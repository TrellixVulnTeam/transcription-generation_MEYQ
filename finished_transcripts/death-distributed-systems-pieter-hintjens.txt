Transcription: Peter Hitchens grew up writing software by himself the act of writing code brought him great pleasure but the isolated creative process disconnected him from the rest of the world as Peter's life progressed he became involved in open-source communities and he discovered a passion for human interaction open source software it succeeds or fails on the strength of the community one story of success is zeromq a popular open-source distributed messaging system that was started by Peter Hitchens in this episode Peter gives his thoughts on human nature distributed systems and death in his recent blog post a protocol for dying Peter discussed his own terminal diagnosis of cancer and how it has reframed his perspective on life after a quick message from today's sponsor we will get to this episode death and distributed systems with Peter Hitchens

 Peter Hitchens is the creator of zeromq and an open-source Advocate Peter welcome to software engineering daily a few months ago called a protocol for dying and it is as much about your life and what you enjoy as it is about death and in that post you explain how your relationship to other human beings has changed since you are young man you describe your younger self as being somewhat disconnected somewhat lonely perhaps autistic but very much in love with the act of writing code and in contrast to that you describe the pleasures of socializing that you now enjoy later in your life and I think many programmers can understand the tension between the isolated creative process of writing code and the joy of socializing with others how has your appreciation for socialization evolved over time
 how to describe it as a tension is very good because we have this feeling that if we're not coding we're wasting time somehow and I remember my spare time was spent cooling I would you not going all the way from my company take over a week and I would I would write code for them for a week safely and that was my greatest passion
 and it took me a very very long time to come to this understanding I have today that this works I mean that works as a as a solo Pursuit but it's it's often very sterile and ineffective in comparison to collect calling I don't think we have a good time for this yet open-source strive to be Collective it often isn't open is driven by a few Eagles and what we do in our 02 Community is really becoming kind of a collective sport where there are thousands of people working on on parts of a project at the same time in real time I'm building something without anyone having any idea what's actually going on
 and this is something really interesting I think it's say an emergent truth of how we innovate as a species and I think we see this more more now and software because our our tools allowed is it wasn't possible before the personal property emotional component to it where you have this very you get this sense of pleasure from codeine by yourself and isolation but then the emotional side of socialization you get this this Joy of socializing with others that may be comes from evolution evolutionary emotional properties and there's also the productivity side of it you know you got this momentum when you're developing as an individual contributor but you can get much more momentum out of the crowd is a hold of the credit utilized and I think this is this is you can draw an analogy between the problems that arise in communities from centralization and also the problems that arise industry
 system centralization is is a core problem in distributed systems if you have a single point of failure in your distributed systems obviously vulnerable and if you have a coder who is leading a project and doing 80% of the work then that's a single point of failure if he gets hit by a bus then there's you know you have some serious problems it in Maine that maintain the problem between the code base what are the ways that we have solved issues of centralization in distributed systems and how does that compare to how we have solve these problems within communities All rights organizations in the sulfur they build if they're still for building organizations tend to be self similar
 tweet we've seen the costs of participation used to be quiet asymmetrical so it used to be that there was a team have to have a server and SVN server it was turn of the century if we were lucky and this required Administration require discs required backups required network connections all these are very expensive and then the developers would work on their find laptops and they would send go to the central repository so centralization was a way to solve a problem by putting the cost in one place
 and it works but it only it's on the better than having nothing at all the amino people send each other for what we find time is we could reduce the cost of participation in the every node could become a full-fledged participant in other words get is it comes with a server built in Mississippi by running to get process network connections are very cheap or I have a v e r 200 megabit connection here in my house where I can do 7 month I don't need anymore guitar set for my guitar plus I can get to see some sliced we saw so many of these problems that used to exclude and used to make it a symmetric
 should come to a playing field where anyone can participate as a as a first class Citizen and that we build this criticism is not one of the goals with Z rank you was to build this this first class citizenship into every node so we can have it mean to still have models with clients and service because for some problems centralization is it is a good solution but it's one of you know it's a tapestry here and there was centralized there and every decentralized
 I think there's an interesting contrast you can also drop between you know these types of decentralized projects and then Corp corporations like corporations have one or two at the top and corporations can be extremely successful organizations and I think about Steve Jobs a lining Apple around this mission of creating the iPhone in this is the only way that you can create something like the iPhone are there things that is centralized organization has the power to do that a decentralized one cannot do or have we just as the human race has not learned how to do this at a decentralized level yet so everything about this I think two extremes of organizational structure when is a pyramid power pyramid and one is a living network marketing system and the power the power Plymouth is very very, Nicki Minaj this for a long time so we build our armies in our Empires and our modern corporations it's been concentrating resources and Power
 the aiming people at a certain goal it's very inflexible look at Apple trying to compete now in China and they have no clue
 trying to compete in general. They have no clue you know that they accepted lost it completely so it's very good at executing a specific strategy and I don't know how long it took Steve Jobs to figure out what he wanted to make it took me to come sometime he came along was able to shift an apple into the structure which was very loyal and very organized towards pulling money from the market and giving it to shareholders me and the owner is an apple and as soon as there's a real chance in the market it breaks down
 so over time you'll see the structures building up extracting massive amounts of profit and their predatory Motors these are not nice organizations within their suppliers in their place and their Workforce in heat
 where is the alternative living system and you know you live in the city of city is a collection of what economy is all doing their thing they last for very long time they can be very social to live in and very profitable for everybody not just for a few people
 yeah speaking of Apple you wrote about that recently that you wrote about the fact that one potential Apple competitor in China is xiaomi which is a smart phone company and she'll be able to leverage the Chinese model of open sourcing Hardware which I think is interesting cuz like 10 or 15 years ago maybe in 5 years ago Hardware open sourcing would be almost unfathomable so it's it's kind of interesting musical to what degree can we open source the world to what degree can we work as a hive mind that what do you think is the
 what is the farthest that Humanity can take this it's a very sensitive the source code for your binary blobs it's about if I make a smartphone can make it better to take it and then prove it and sell he's improved version and how long does it take and what are the rules for remix in his improved version back into my next Generation product and the Chinese at least in some parts of their industry cpf Crank that problem very effectively which gives them cycles of innovation which I'm dying to I think a few days in some cases it's insane Samsung for temple have this and I work with Samsung for a while I know how to work internally there like a multiple collection of of apples they have like the most politicians fighting each other boot cleats triangle at the next hot product and they will have three companies three independent nations fighting over the next Robot vacuum cleaner is the next smartphone and which one was 16 able to get killed
 different model anything Edition and not very much knowledge sharing in that thing was just trying her and you and your new feature on something and you something interesting and it gets copied in a week 2 weeks and will copy not just you know not notice it notice the Cosmetic imitation and gets implemented properly talk about this idea of having competition within an organization between two different products I think I think one interesting Sable this reason I read this recently that Larry Page's funding two different flying car companies right now and I have competing Visions competition even to the earliest stages of this super secretive products building and you know you've talked about this competition is kind of been fostered without animosity how do you build a community that has that competitive element but does not have that animosity
 well they're going to come start to knowledge sharing and the right to remix if it's all top secret than the employees belong to one of their company when they lose they lose their jobs
 in the open source projects Zealand kid projects examples you have several teams working on the same problem but they will move between projects my happily they will be using show this work very happily so what emerges is the best of a mix of and with things taken from one and losing the other and when cold cold eyes and everyone is very happy it's much easier and more fun to work on successful quote before using and to maintain old Call of Duty wants but has no choice over
 so the secret is knowledge mixing and and ability to move and Destroy old structure very quickly it is not profitable anymore and the cost of failure how big is it cost to failure if you have to be competing teams and the cost of failure is people losing their jobs in their homes that's quite dramatic if the cost of failure is changing of a brand name and people moving offices and you know staying on the same same and specialization whatever that's okay
 so let's show me has lost most competitors but it's also using them that it's at its research divisions and it works very well and there's not really much on my city I mean I'm not very far from China
 somebody will have to find out what's really going on increasing Lee decentralized overtime like you've seen corporations adopt open source in all kinds of ways like you're done with xiaomi maybe he is a kind of an extreme example of that and I think this is a leading indicator for how Society will develop as a whole how do you anticipate this decentralisation process percolating out beyond the software community and into politics and finance and the everyday world
 so yeah that's a good question I think the sharing the knowledge is an old human thing we've always done that we've always done best when they were able to share best to know the wealthiest cities with the ones based on trade and commerce not based on on Broad power in secrecy and it's getting easier and easier to share knowledge of these things getting harder and harder to hoard knowledge and there's also a question of density population density how many mines are able to look at a problem at one moment and identity defines how effective the knowledge sharing is so what it was now reply you know it take a question of legal something bizarre in the law when you can get 10,000 people looking at this would know what they're talking about that wasn't possible before so there becomes real competition for the old another kind of the closed we own the specialist we can define specialization cuz we own the lawyers we own this the politicians whatever to Anna Moore open system where there's your competition they will always be a tension between
 power centralization and decentralization I think that's inevitable I think that's part of the human arms race I want to own this or we will do this together there's a real
 fight there in that fight is also I think really essential to how we progress as a species. I'm now with the decentralized autonomous organization which is this this thing that they're trying to do where you can spend up these these corporations basically that are decentralized and I have a decentralized compensation structure and do you think this is going to be successful centralized organization format from the the cryptocurrency community
 I don't know if it's successful in the the long-term in terms of their actual goals but in terms of a raising the question is being successful already the very concept of a decentralized investment fund this is a strange thing and I think it's an amazing love you gotten here already and if people are you know really interesting in this I hope that if it feels it doesn't actually you know her too many people but the long-term success comes from exploring these things whether we were they successful individual do or not
 are there elements of I mean you you were heavily involved in distributed systems communities are there elements when you look at the blockchain and irium in Bitcoin are the elements of what they are doing with distributed systems that can the that you look at the end you're like oh these can be reapplied to things that are not financially related like a are there are there structured or is this more of the financial structure adopting things in the distributor systems world that have already existed
 well I know everything expert in this so take it with a pinch of salt and I'm sure I've seen a few I've seen a few different aspects of this there are four example ways to use blockchain for contracts
 which are basically in a signed agreement between parties and doesn't require doesn't require a third-party to be holding these are to be publishing them or something so I think the
 I mean technically which ended the disorder between humidity and the Dew General two different security is using zeromq in a very small scale here and there it's not a decentralized product in the sense of sending the messages that I speed on the serum QMobile at all
 but in terms of giving everybody the ability to be a first-class player it has very much the same vision you had removing the ability for anyone to say I own this system so that's that's completely it's even much more aggressive in Z room key I would say in many ways and tons of decentralization about Shopper communities you've also written books about tributed systems and my sense is that the field of distributed systems research evolves so quickly and Bitcoin all the developments within there are examples of that you know it's like this new product that is Bitcoin in the blockchain community so when you were heavily involved working with zeromq when you are just in Deep In The Weeds when was your main focus did you feel
 I need to keep up with the academic research of distributed systems or did you just come naturally not at all Now quickly I think what we see is a lot of movement a lotof you know I use the mobile and I do use this a few times but the ants and ant nest and we in the bed like ants find food so ask move a lot if you look at the actual and legs and I'm cleaning moving you'll see you'll see lots of movement and if you try to measure the ant colonies progress by then you know the number of steps that its individual and soul together it's overwhelming it's cute Romantic Movement in his really really innovating but maybe it's not finding any food
 so there's you I think you have to have a distinction in your mind between movement and accuracy
 so
 this being a lesbian is big fight in our community over those two things and getting away from movement to get into art accuracy and accuracy means solving problems which are actually there was people actually care about now you're actually works holding in terms of money for somebody and I'm going away from Vision driven the movement where you know I believe there are problems in the future which people will if you listen to me hard enough make money from solving who do we find that to be kind of pretentious first of all but also often very very wrong
 case look like for example in Z room cute with his big this big idea that we should put you in a few into the Linux kernel right
 that someone who smokes something and it's going to be an idea apps it it makes great sense if you don't actually use during cute at all
 right and I'm using ceramic you sees this and says what is this your why are you even spending time on this we have other issues return really really pressing in which we really would actually like to self so much Focus away from ideology two words
 finding ways to find real problems in this field in solving them as fast as we can and checking the solutions against the program and filtering I had back problems in that solution so we get is actually a functional result Academia again and I'm sorry that's my opinion academics don't actually use what they making actually trying to make money from their work they're disconnected from the market and the doing research which may be very accurate in circumstances may be very useful at certain point in time that we need today I don't know how often
 so we we don't follow Academia we we follow
 are users and we try to get them integrated into our thinking process tightly so that they are actually doing the the research for us in real-time response. I do think it's interesting just like the the founding of the distributed systems world did kind of come out of Academia but I mean Leslie Lamport I think he and he only was able to write the packs of paper I think because he was trying to solve these problems for himself he only came to these to this realization about these things that you need out of access from working with these working with these things boots on the ground I'm going to bed I'm going to be a really I mean I don't see anyone actually use Praxis in Android applications
 it's too slow and too clumsy into complex no one can really understand it and it doesn't actually do I actually need that level of reliability turns out I had an experience in practice we have clothes and other things at work quite nicely but you're much simpler and that's what people actually use so there's a disconnect there right my extent of understand this resistance is mostly like taking a class in college so maybe I have a completely biased understanding of the articulated the things that we need to be talking about an in this field was it was it actually more of a case of like a lot of people were talking about these things and I don't have you on this history
 so this should I've seen that is what we've based our our journey on is the pragmatic problem of people with a lot of computers and having to connect these in high-performance networks and swing money at the problem until they salted
 and it took him a lot of money I'm talking about financial institutions Banks and trading trading Banks investment banks in the late 90s and 2000's they acquired other Banks and they began doing automatic trading or at least connecting thousands of Traders under their Windows Excel PCS to to data feeds
 and this was a really really hard that's a problem to solve at the time it was an unknown thing and it will crash with the most bizarre reasons like you have some trailer on his windows up Windows machine it going to a console by mistake and He will draw a square and go for lunch and it would look that machine because the old days when you when you do the copy paste selection box on Windows 95 CPU and so it was so preceding date on the server was back up until we crash and still be 5000 traded that anything going on
 so how do you not know how you know crash when one person has a frozen PC
 well the answer is quite obvious once you've gone through this pain and you figured it out you throw away his dates are he is not there if he loses his discussion
 so the finance industry the stock market's the banks the big Banks spent billions on solving these problems and going through generations of a really really good Engineers who had to figure out ways and most of what they did was rubbish. Usually it was expensive and it wasn't very efficient and just over time they got better and better and Patrick and Susie ramq we would have took that cuz we work for JP Morgan Chase and the Dow Jones the Dow Jones right on my software for 4 years just relax and we took what we had learnt there and we made it simpler
 I will be discovered was that the biggest problem that we have to solve in Syracuse in the performance and it wasn't portability I mean these are technical problems which we can solve became Simplicity and it was how do you make this technology available to Ordinary People or any developer who don't have the background in the time to learn you know to make this their specialty they're building there sulfur and when they get distributed them distributed systems engineer
 so we wouldn't fight in complexity for years and that's what we've been with you could happen to you if you make it simpler simpler and say prince in plural
 so I want to talk some about your your post a protocol for dying and just your your general condition right now so you don't know you have a terminal diagnosis cancer cholangiocarcinoma and so I'm curious about your process of of understanding that diagnosis cuz you're not biologist by trading but you're a scientist and I think you're many of the people who listen to the show an end we don't many computer scientist in general they're just they're curious about everything so as a scientist you must be interested in the literature about your condition cholangiocarcinoma carcinoma
 an nie I know that with medical conditions that he seems to be like a rabbit hole of of information and to what extent have you tried to educate yourself about the mechanics of cancer to what degree have you ever drove down the rabbit hole to try to understand what is going on in your body
 to be honest just not very far I'm just trying to figure out what I actually had than what my what my prognosis was and then then I stopped because to be honest and honestly it's terrifying if you actually start reading in bed especially bile duct cancer which I have cholangiocarcinoma and it seems like you have this you die I like nobody want to read this over and over again and the
 what do I find Houston was it it's a very rare cancer cells interested buyer you know how do I get this I know what happened to me I don't have any history my family I don't have any of the normal precursors to powder cancer to very bizarre cancer especially in Europe in America so I find out that it comes from most likely from a liver fluke and it said to put a person's disease in Southeast Asia and it's almost as a forgotten disease I think there's waves of cheap sushi coming into America and Europe which will killed many people I think I'm I'm kind of at the Forefront of this setting in fashion here
 what is it raining nasty cancer so the you know reading about it and it's just it's just not fun and I think it's enough to understand you know do I know what you know I'm going to flip a coin here to Idaho do I die at this point do I have 6 months or do I have not 6 months and then that's enough how you think about just like long tail risks of of human-caused luckily it's like this totally uninterested pated condition that you got your best guess is that it resulted resulted from some bad sushi that you ate essentially you ended up getting cancer from some bad sushi that you ate and you know this is like crazy tail risk weirdness but I think this is like no discussion that happens as often in everyday of society is it cold like there are so many long tail ways that you can end up attracting an illness or you think about like
 Lyme disease are so many people get Lyme disease is just like his chronic thing that ends up going to lasting for super long and it's really hard to diagnose really hard to detect really hard to treat and you know especially like working in computer science which is like this human manufactured field where the problems like are pretty easy to Define even when you have Byzantine failures in distributed systems you can kind of say okay these are just these are disturbing sisters problems we can kind of enumerate how he's going to happen but in biology it is this crazy Black Box Thing compared to computer science so how how do you reckon with that how has has it changed how you think about the world or head you kind of already come to this conclusion about biology in the Black Box Enos in the tail risk before you actually got cancer
 so I actually got the cancer 5 years ago 2010 2011 and was operated and survived it was very bizarre
 even the decision you know will be operate on you was like you will live for you will die it was a very complicated operation that they did the Whipple procedure they call it so once they had to wait on me and I was able to get to that I'm okay I'm alive this is this is this is this is intense this was unexpected I thought I was going to die and I didn't and I took me about a year just to settle down from that feeling and I was convinced I was going to get sick again at some point so I was trying to plan my life in terms of finish my projects get my
 earn money pay off my debts write some books stop being so you know stop not working for anybody but didn't really want that wanted to happen in one more short Turner like things being much more family person look nice my kids much more witches which is great and that was really a good realignment I think the notion of living on borrowed time as a way to improve the quality of the things I did in my life and I know every patches are last patch I believe this was a
 somebody was I already started at somebody who's dying with cancer and eat after the speech you would give too many people that might make this every thing you do your last the last thing make a kind that was a nice philosophy to live with and then this year I got sick again and it came back massages and it's worse because they can't operate and it's just the same it's a very aggressive cancer now we're doing chemo and the chemo is a very brutal chemo takes me about a week to recover from it and it's every two weeks so I like one week off when we come I'm just now today like getting back and I should be coughing and vomiting but I'm able to speak for a while

 why is it that as humans we need to have this experience where we come face-to-face with death in order to to gain this this fire in our belly to to really like work as hard of a can or two you know right the books that we've always wanted to ride her have the relationship with her family that we've always wanted to have it seems like no we as humans we witnessed a throughout our life we see our parents die or receive friends die or whatever never hit this is close to home as to when we personally have a near-death experience why is it that we need to actually experience it to get that
 imperative it's biology Jeff this is just Evolutions made us like that that's just a stupid answer I don't know
 have no clue I mean I don't think everybody that I know people who have the diagnosis cancer we just getting it very depressed and very unhappy and they just pulled up and collapse basically so I think that's an individual thing I think it's in some people thrive on danger I don't like danger that some people need like constant danger just to feel alive and other people don't like that at all and if they get stressing they collapsing other people are in the middle and evil devil you know something some thread will make them run faster running better directions I don't know it woke me up that's for sure I mean it woke me up and told me enough to fix things in my life to certain extent
 so I have no problem accepting at this time around I was like okay I know what's coming I understand it's already accepted death before I can go there again and it wasn't hard to talk about it in to express that but I have to say actually the chemo was kind of working so I have to be kind of snotty optimistic I have it there's already enough in this is this is very experimental chemo cuz I have chemo for a completely different kinds of interest rate on me someone someone has been trying this and it seems to be working so I may have longer to live than I thought when I work my blog post about time
 yay
 what that mean that's great because it like it is so different than computer science and maybe you know yet you haven't thought about this or you're not interested in talking about this we have the luxury of being able to be very rigorous about how we test our systems we can usually get a very large dataset and we can to clean days that we could separate variables from each other in a convincing way but my impression is that in biology there so many moving Parts especially therapy you just don't have anywhere close to the same degree of certainty about cause and effect as you can find in computer science and Sunday no friend Eva Jewel cases and this is an interesting thing about very large systems is that you can't actually predict you know what happens if any one point you can measure it for sure you can see what's happening but you can't predict it you've lost control does that level of complexity so you know
 the chemotherapy works for certain percentage okay are you going to be in that percentage of you have no clue how many months do you have you have no clue can they tell you it was his actually they can't measure it you know on a monthly basis and see or weekly basis to see while you're you know you're getting better or you're not getting better for some cancers they they have
 such a large amount of data that they said they can pretty much know okay this cancer we can operate and it can be gone but even then there's always all kind of stuff that happens and that's why I think that's part of being a doctor is that you accept this but you don't really have any any real control over these things you do your best
 did you have a sense of like is like big data or sensors or Internet of Things he's just going to end up changing the convincingly changing cancer treatments and or or is the the end of one of the human the human interaction with a specific medicine is this do you think this is unfathomably complex what is your sense of that I mean science uses big data as far as it can borrow just so using big data and I don't think there's any way that
 to second-guess this I don't like people do this all the time if you tried the special diet or you should think about this and that and it's like it why would you second-guess modern medicine you know this is the result of thousands of years of work by people who have done really really everything humanly possible to collect knowledge in to throw away bad ideas and keep good ideas and keep doing this and it's a global scale
 the only sad thing is that medicine is slow to use new technology has to be quite cautious about that to research is still slow and don't share knowledge as much as they could and they're not using systems as much as they could but they do catch up eventually
 eventually end the world of medicine does learn from computer science overtime. Do you see anything in the medical community when you see all these may I see the interaction between doctors and nurses and stuff do you see anything that
 the computer scientists could learn from the medical community in the way that the Medical Teams operate together
 have a good question there I don't I don't know maybe the notion that you don't really have control in that everything is is applying procedures and and measuring results and you know I'm not sure I have to think about that one for a while
 interesting so I mean when you wrote a protocol for dying your post got a lot of attention and as you wrote on your blog you said of course I love the attention and you said for years I have worked to promote myself as a product and I'm not sure whether this quote was serious or a joke likes to argue that you're promoting yourself as a product is an interesting point of discussion we certainly as a podcaster and I'm building a might try to build a personal brand I think I think a lot I think there's more value in that than people maybe give the idea credit 40 do you think the software developers should try harder to build up their personal brand
 I mean if it fits their you know their Vision no for all the things I wanted to be a writer and I want to be a conference speaker and I want to go to charge extraction at message money for being really really
 famous I think security good because many people are very cute and smart but I want to be able to live an independent existence and for me that was like okay I've tried many different ways of earning my living and I want to try this you know this egocentric narcissistic
 which is not really me I am not really a person who likes to shut about themselves but this was my decision a few years ago one of these life in her life changing things I'm going to become a conference speaker and going to lunch be good at this travel around and be comfortable presenting myself is my product and right right right right right
 and if you do that then if you decide to be a blogger and took to have a name and then you forgot your name then that becomes your your product it becomes what you're selling that image of who you are and what you talk about in your ability to think about certain things and talk about certain things
 many people attacks and it was just interesting like who are you talk about this subject and the pain from very very negative reactions to anyone who claims to be
 different possibly but that's part of being a bunch of being the one that want to be celebrity I think
 so what what drives you to want to go to want to be a speaker I mean what would drove you to to get yourself there to that position where you could have angeleyes was it such a strong set of ideas that you really wanted to get out there and you felt that evangelism was the only way that you would get them out there will always be
 I've always coached people and had been very good at synthesizing complex things into simple models which were good and which were usable reusable and teachable what was done that but I wanted to work from home and I want to spend time with my children and I want to be able to not be in an office with people 9 to 5 and that meant that meant having something else then then you know my business is the first class object or me and a team somewhere make me being individually recognizable
 have a kind of worked that kind of works
 yeah it's interesting to me because like I am I personally I love computer science I love software engineering but I kind of moved quickly beyond the stage where I was like I want to be a programmer you know I like talking to people that's how I know that's kind of why I ended up doing this podcast so I mean it is there anything I mean how do you overcome why can't you stop do you stop programming for 0 and cute at a certain point of you I think you moved into more of like kind of a imagine usually more of a governmental roll right like how did you how did you make that shift from being a software developer into more of a diplomat or an arbitrator GitHub
 chart up to date and it was like a fool until until March this year so I worked a lot on this year if you called library close on the C binding cesium Q I don't know the projects around. And that's always been very important as because I love programming first of all and I can't imagine I couldn't imagine today I kind of stopped programming but I couldn't imagine being part of the community and not expressing myself through code which is how we communicate I've tried we've been very good at not communicating through discussions today like that we can make it through patch and we have minimal discussion on patches it sounds weird but actually works very well so to be part of this community the only thing I can really do is come along with ideas in the form of new projects with tools and maybe pick up and find useful and to encourage others to invest in those projects and try and build them up if they're useful and kill them if they're not
 and then the managerial part is not his being
 writing sets of guidelines that we use our contracts for collaboration which we use and now and then coaching people on that and running running workshops now and then hackathons but it's it's doesn't require much management the whole point of this organization was its decentralized and runs itself for 99% didn't used to be like that all the time but it's gotten to that point where it's extremely self-sufficient you think about the community dynamics of the zeromq community I need the expertise that you have in communities and dynamic you found this love of talking to communities in management communities I think if this can be exemplified by the fact that the zeromq community really does not have arguments and Flame War switch you
 you seeing in some other communities have had more acrimony more problematic situations I think it's like the Lenox community perhaps or the note JS Community which know Jess was forked at some point right and I had to be rude diplomatically organize back together and I'm not I'm not saying anything against these Technologies but do you think is there something about the nature of these technologies that results in the arguments of the communities or is it the way that the communities themselves happened to be structured the structure of the communities and we used to have fights and um can we had a fork Crossroads in 2010 2011 which itself was Fort again and I'm
 and the mechanism seem quite clear you have this
 we have this in here in the conflict between
 let me be nice about this division Aries and the users and you occasionally have Vision Reeser also users they're kind of rare generally you you have The Visionaries who have the idea of making something in there very aggressive by to the news at themselves and their own private work but other people are second-class in that process the other people's opinions and needs come in later and they spend all their time trying to sell their ideas to people I mean look at something like systemd and you'll see this fight very very clearly the problem they're sold in his about his problem the way they're sold and it is very aggressive and I see pretty exclusive and it's very very traumatic to users who are forced to accept this but I'd any choice they really is running down their throats by Brute Force
 we still have that and zeref you in my job was to mediate between the Visionary Visionary spawn a tooth and and the user's and try to make stuff that was actually stable and reliable and if I could I could keep this going for a few years and then it stopped working because division you decided to take over my job of Packaging
 I got point I kept them up and said they were no longer welcome
 and I moved very conscious it a point to community towards a much more collaborative mode where they were no more Visionaries that's got to be harmless to other people and I was able to
 to trial and error so these are things that we have observed in other projects in vehicle Exodus knowledge of how to do this that there are ways of getting a group of people to work together which will remove all of the emotional discussion and focus on actually moving forward and the same people with the different process will fight and argue
 it's very simple I go to a conference room and I will say okay before we start you could agree on an editor
 hand soap who uses Kate hand soap uses Vim hands up use emacs and you'll see people starting to look confusing
 support an extreme example that you won't move forward he could have agreement on such bizarre things right
 no no it's totally fine I was going to see if it is there any place for emotion like our is there are there types of things where people have an emotional response to that have value like where the emotion definitely good emotions like being happy. Someone's merger pull request you feeling welcome in the group and feeling satisfied if someone's using your work and feeling confirm that you're her change was was looked at seriously and sometimes being annoyed that your change was referred to them okay these are all valid emotions but being frustrated it someone is not merging you pull request because you've used tabs instead of spaces that's not good in motion
 are there any books that teach you ideas that you would if you had if you had time to write like another another book or another two or three books like what are the books that you would write
 the last book I wrote is one called social architecture
 which is a kind of a summary of different blog articles and sections from other books which were discussing how to build online communities
 and that's it that's really like the core of this course thesis of how do people work together without being tribalistic and without being confrontational and how do you move an army of people to work progress without having to get a green at the front what they're doing
 Bates Motel is based on real research on the internet for about 10 10 years with community so different kinds and seeing what working with it and what didn't work it apply to open source communities do they generally apply to forums an instructor that look at you see these like forms that come up and then they hit this evening at this critical mass than they break like there's this level of intimacy early on in the community I find that the intimacy is often times what is keeping people there so that it is like this perverse thing where if you can't scale that feeling of intimacy that you can't scale the community they're speaking about read it right I used to be a part of where it was interesting cuz like people would people early on in the days when I was just like 200 to 300 people people would very eagerly share knowledge and strategy and then overtime people realize that these you know when they shared a strategy it would they would find themselves facing down upon opponent who had that stay
 allergy to people stop sharing knowledge and the entire Community just broke down and I think we still have a lot of research to do and how to build that kind of communities like someone was
 criticizing I mean we all use Twitter and someone was criticizing Twitter and explaining it and it's a really did they hit on a really good point is that you basically can't you can't remove strangers from the conversation and the thing is she don't get on committees don't benefit from giving everyone the right to speak all the time on any subject
 like we don't do that Jim Carrey don't say anyone can talk about anything like if you come into discussion where you have no merit where you have no basis and start talking about it you'll be you'll be told to go away politely but firmly
 if you are trying to discuss the you know the rules regulation of a project in you have never contributed to the project people tell you know who are you what's your standing here so the notion of some kind of an entry cost and some overtime to separate the while the passing trolls and people who just really want to argue and there are so many people they can read this treatment is very very very quickly it's around filters
 and I think that we're still not very good at that and I'm in in public forum but I think you still have a lot to learn their dad what you wrote about in a protocol for dying and Scott so much attention I know you're thinking a lot about death so I have you thought about what happens after you die if you thought about the nature of reality much or is this just like not at all a concern to you I think it just continues you know that you honestly
 how many Italian people people throw up most of your stuff and the rest they argue over if you're lucky and then that's it right
 it's just like a server being shut off
 or like I made it to my children about you know my mind younger son who's going against me you know why why I had to die and I explain finally to my two boys you know you you make that has just never really existence in the real they are real in their tangible and you believe in them and they have they have life and then you break it has its up and put them back in the box houses that people are like that. We're not we're not really that special when I believe that precious we think we are that's interesting about us cover special but we're not really special me know that you'll die and that's just part of it so I don't see it as a
 that's how you know
 anything important I think it's it's how you live which is important to the thing I really like the birds
 how do I put this thing I really appreciated about getting sick and having the time to frame this properly was I was able to involve lots of people in the process of thinking about this and going through it when I die it will be the end of a process not the beginning of a person spring that's my goal
 I don't want to die and then leave all this chaos and stress and worry and Trauma I went to tie in a second no thank God he's gone finally in it's all cleaned up and we've had our party in a bit you know it until a friend said goodbye he bought his books and I think it's much more fun in much healthier you have an orderly clean up step you know that you don't have like a dangling pointers exactly where but I always find myself thinking a lot about the nature of reality are we living in a simulation is simulation hypothesis stuff it sounds like it this is just it is not something that you're concerned with it all you don't think about it all is that is that accurate
 I think we all think the Centerpoint of Our Lives you all at some point wonder you know are aliens watching us in a message game it's just I had that when I was 12 13 I was convinced that this was all set up just couldn't possibly be real this is not too weird mix this life is just too alien it's going to be someone is a huge massive joke right and then I realize it's not a joke that's actually real and it's are aliens they really don't care they're not watching us and they're not if it's a simulation whenever quick to tell the difference and so asking is it simulation is complete waste of time okay okay they're all the questions but you can ask which are also a waste of time you know and then you asking questions it would a waste of time because you don't go anywhere with him I mean there's no profit in in asking you know what is the you know what happens when the universe
 if you do I have left how cold is the fridge right my friend said you going to bring some barbecued goat meat across I'm really waiting for his goat meat and this is really important and fun intangible and tangible and I think that there's
 I think it's normal to certain point in your life to have this kind of space in your head that's looking for this our questions but I think you have to go out with that I think you're right it's just like what is to what happens if you like I got this fear of like being Too Young Too Much on to the local maximum of what is feasible what is realistic like should I just focus on how I get my goat meat for the rest of the day if I do that I know I'm going to be satisfied and I'm going to have a tangibly happy day but what if that is like the local Maxima of what is a chief like how do I avoid getting trapped into that local Maxima addiction
 I don't think this is again this is I don't think something that we have to be too worried about me being very successful just as a social species we've done this our biology is equipped us to jump around and there are how many billions of us are there in a triangle from things in different parts of the world it's very unlikely that we're going to get trapped in the same local Maxima
 pretty much impossible and that means that just requires one person to have one idea to spread some goofy roll-off we're all from different engines again
 and we do this is a species very very good moving forward since holding big complex problems just by thinking about them slowly together little by little and colonies and I think I think the answer happy I think the answer is going to be okay with that situation they know that they're not really that important they do their best and they they die happy with some sugar water
 Chester's since you you have written up for dying you've talked to a lot of people about it garnered a lot of attention so I imagine some of the ideas that you discussed in that post have you evolved so just just to to begin to close off like what are the things that have evolved is there any are there any addendums to the protocol for dying that you wrote
 I'm not sure I'm in the situation changes so I wrote that when I was in a particular situation I was I had I had lung cancer and I still do and I had pneumonia which is going away now and I was really sick and I was like okay I want to express the state of being violently ill and how it makes me feel when people come to visit
 which is mostly good on this damn people visiting come there and stay beside me it was actually like oh thank God I'm not alone with this miserable miserable situation
 when things get better and when you're able to run around and do stuff then it's different you don't want to tell everyone hey I'm sick I'm sick you know if I can you can you don't have to sleep for half an hour afterwards you know you got to sleep for 2 days it's a lot better than you were so it's a contest to a thing and I think that post that post was was perfect for the moment I think it for a lot of tension because of its it's wrong as it was very wrong I didn't really think about it very carefully I wouldn't write that today at all I wouldn't be able to I wouldn't be able to write that again
 I would write something different suggestions do you have for software Engineers listening to this for how they should manage their software projects in the future and how they should manage their lives
 good question soap software Projects please make open source don't make closers I know that people will pay you to make losers they will pay you they will bribe you to convince you that this more money and profit but you won't see that money on profit going to go to somebody else almost all the time and as soon as you turn your back that's what's going to go in the garbage bin and you know it and your life Works may be thrown away and you will come I'm 5354 in December that I can look at all the years I spent writing clue source and they're just died years does nothing there no fruit and I have open source projects which are 15 20 years older still being used
 show me some compounding interest and still compounding interest in getting back to be more useful not less useful it is amazing so that's the first thing is please please please make open Services it's the only sane way to write software in the century if you're still making closers you know God have mercy on your soul number to she going to make open source make community be part of community don't tolerate you know any companies we tolerate a lot of pain we told her a lot of shity management because we're paid to be there so we accept a lot of rubbish done except I end up in an open source open source doesn't buy happiness and pleasure of working with people make you find things aren't pleasurable and happy either fix them or leave and start your own and we've built rules with both kinds with. How to switch are on my contract C4 protocols everything you lie on how to do this with lots of explanation and it works
 so this is like how to be a happy programmer which is the best gift I can give anyone in this world in this in this business as you can and you can be happy doing it right that's great well Anna and I think I think I think you're one of the best Arguments for open-source here it's just that it's the best way to leave a legacy and you're going to leave a great legacy and I'm so glad that you can watch out for a drink daily and really really happy to have found out about you and your writing and just thank you so much for your for your contributions and I I hope I hope you are I hope this podcast can contribute to the Legacy that's is being left around you when and if you pass away
 thank you very much Jeff I appreciate this very much indeed thank you so much beer

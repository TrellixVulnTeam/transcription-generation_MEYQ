Transcription: when a human passes away we create a tombstone as a memorial friends and family visited grave to remember the times that we had with that person while they were still alive Memorial Bots are another way to celebrate the life of someone who has passed away I Memorial bought is created by taking the messages sent by a deceased person when they were alive and passing it through a machine learning model in order to make a bot that replicates the deceased person Eugenia koida is the CEO of Luca a company that builds a i products when her friend Roman mazurenko suddenly died she worked with her team to make a bot that replicates his speech patterns in our interview we discussed Memorial box deep learning and the product that Luca is working on right now replica a personal AI friend for anyone this was a very interesting and touching show about the intersection of technology and culture and society and how are norms are changing with technology

 Eugene Dakota is the CEO of Luca a company that builds a i products Eugenia welcome software engineering daily begins with the loss of your friend Roman mazurenko he was a talented computer scientist who was a leader and he built products and companies describe your relationship with Roman before he passed away I guess we're just friends we're living together in the same apartment in San Francisco OK major lost you experienced in your life nothing at this scale for sure how did it impact you personally customer there was a long report about in The Verge it was very painful for anybody to read emotional and
 Fortune II I don't think I've dealt with the loss of anyone very close to me but I can think of a lot of people in my life that are we totally crushed if they disappeared how did you cope with the loss and do you think you cope with it in ways that were different than typical people this is basically everything around us requires us to be fully productive almost all the time and no there's no release face for Wii for for you for people to post their own emotions I guess being emotional about it is why less like a sense of weakness are supposed to be fully operational almost like the next day so I don't know what I was going to go swimming with a different from other people just hang out just try to move on as quickly as possible and work
 so we will get into the discussion of the chatbot that you made to simulate your friend Roman talking more broadly about just a question of grief how do psychologists look at the grieving process do they typically I mean is it better to spend time reminiscing about your experience with somebody after they pass away are you supposed to move Beyond it as quickly as possible like funerals are often so soon after somebody dies it's it's almost like we're not in courage to dwell on the death we're just kind of encourage sweep it under the rug and move Beyond it as fast as possible and obviously like the common sense is always you know you have to face your feelings and actually feel that I've been accepted and only done you know
 only after I thought I might get some closure or just the only basically way to deal with it I don't know I'm actually I haven't seen that you know much about it or I wasn't that interested in actually how what what experts think about it so I can't really say I'm just I just think that you know being not having a ritual or some sort of like a way to process or guess it sort of ritual for the 21st century is not helping that's what I'm trying to say certainly so getting into that ritual you were spending a lot of time scrolling through his text messages when he after he passed away why did you do that was it therapeutic for you to read back through the interactions that you would had with Roman I guess you know we always want to miss someone that's cool that's what I usually do
 person right now please I'm fine I always go back to her practicing feed I guess for me is like one of the ways to and I remember when tractions and go through the same feelings that we had back then just you know we do not photograph every single day of her life and this rock and if I had to do play the most attempt to put together some sort of you no more polished way to polish representation of our life so I guess this is something that definitely allows us to be you know to just feel something you no more to say but if they ask for me the way to keep the number to go why did you ultimately decide to make a bot out of his text messages wasn't like that I just thought you know where I would why not like we have the technology went up to it just seems like you know there was no specific moment off like you I should just do this
 what I feel is his right I just thought Mike why not you know sounds like a will have it will have to talk I always played with the idea that you know sometimes we can spell degenerative bottle like a girl that were close I would actually be able to mimic the wave the wave person talks and we've been playing around with it before building blocks for Silicon Valley that the show Friends that's what we're doing so and I want this game around really and type of bought I've heard it called a memorial bought the idea that you after somebody passes away you make a bot out of their text messages what are the the benefits and the risks or like the downsides of Memorial Bots I have not heard of any other boss far from what we did for this so it would be
 hard for me to make a generalization out of it you know we kind of did it for the first time I guess in history so what kind of have to face the whole but when I went to face like a bunch of different questions and try to answer them for the first time he's obviously you know when you take text from different conversations you see that a person is very different when he's talking to you know his friends or his family you know I talk about work and even different friends get different versions of yourself and actually it was interesting I don't think a lot of people realize that or analyze that or you know have a chance to actually look at it from the outside we have this chance and you know it was very obvious that you know it's just very very different
 you know very different we are very different people with different people so
 I guess there was no it was hard to understand what causes water should actually be like shouldn't be as open as he was with me should be the ball that's you know a little bit more reserved a little bit more if I can ask for personal growth yourself and again since and what if he says something that you weren't expecting you know to say and someone gets like hard feelings about it so a bunch of different questions that were facing interesting what you say about the polished public feed that we make of ourselves on Facebook or another social network versus the individual conversations that we have with people which you know I may have a conversation with you and then I have a conversation with somebody else and these two people would have completely different perceptions of who I am so if you were to combine those as training data for the same bought you might get kind of a mixed
 experience get absolutely and that was like one of the things like you know what do we do with this should we what are we keep what we would delete what do I added how do we edit like Kristen want this to be public ever or no sew and I just thought of thinking that we're not we was not completely like it was hard to make sense I want and you know what those things are really don't want to mess right either one of us was able to get those wrong because that's important subject for your something that's you take yourself very personally so for me that was I don't want to make a couple extra long time for that let's get into the engineering how did you build the botkin describe the process is a smaller data set and train the no conversation of motor oil goes in any way that it can replicate the personality
 and we just use this it's the same thing we used to build our Silicon Valley Show Box can you describe it in more detail what uses deep learning movies explain why deep learning is particularly effective for this sort of problem really have like a rule base system that would be that would allow you to hell that would allow you to cover so many different use cases right like so if you're building roller kit wheelbase system it obviously will be limited to adjust an area of responsibility can cover with wolves with a neural network you can cover with lock with lower Precision office leave like lower quality but you still can cover many more different areas of conversation and again when you're not trying to build something task-oriented which I should requires the you like roll the Precision of the rules the rules gay give you
 if you're trying to be like in general conversation that actually can be very can go and very in multiple different directions and you're not solving test so there's no like a ejected go said in the conversation then I noticed a small glass just much more suitable so you're talking about the flexibility of building a model with deep flirting versus the rigidity of defining a model yourself can you contrast this process ease a little more but I think the listeners have very degrees of expertise in machine learning so if you could just describe these processes a little bit more cuz they're so popular these days another important concepts for people to start learning to be great to hear your diagnosis of these two areas
 I was started it started for you I should almost 4 years ago and now working with the idea that we're going to build me know the best conversational engine out there and obviously 3 years ago like the only thing you actually had was different there was no deep learning for conversational conversations I've Done Right the population of powers were not there they were not push that you could use the room based approach and you know what tried so many different ways to build like a the festival base conversation or anything comes up with the very robust assembly the very end with a great garlic Moto will buy solid model that allows us to build very quickly very deep conversations about however
 is that a yes of course you can build a pretty deep and flexible conversation once paid in one space like a hard inquiry a lot of precision of flaws like a lot of rules in a lot of you know I'm going to find around them and it requires you know basically heart you know hard coating everything which is a great approach but it's on a scalable as an approach and obviously you know more as a conversation that people value are usually little bit more flexible ones that are not task-oriented or surprising
 surprising twist and turns in them and for that I need something that is a little bit more scale of a little more flexible that can be trained on real conversation to get replicate them and for that licking you all approaches you know that were proposed is much better so basically how it works we would take like a huge day this out of conversations and you'll train your photo on that works for example we use its 8:50 different 50 million different one

 chatbots often have a reinforcement learning feature where they continue to learn as you talk to them does the memorial body built for your friend Roman have this feature where it continues to learn or has it been trained and it's going to be the same for the for the rest time it's not you it is not using reinforcement where I am right now and actually to be fair I would not name
 I might not know something for a few know they're mostly know about that even Power by Neil conversational mode of what a lot of you know and obviously there is no my first learning is part of it or actually the first company to launch I bought that would be powered by Neil conversation little but it will not work that was even before Microsoft lunch then take it was in famously here saying bad things to people over Twitter on Twitter so yeah as long as you talk to it but it would have saw me using bring for snowboarding which is a very specific technique yeah I think that was a adaptation of a bot that they built the Microsoft built for a chat service in China and the service when it was on 101 chin one-on-one chat when it was
 call Joy Weiss was much friendlier and more loving and it was kind of reflection of the conversations that it had one-on-one with people and then today was a reflection of the worst corners of Twitter so they ended up being quite Divergent even though that the technology was very similar Chinese temple right now we're building we're focusing fully on a company called on the product called replica if you go in replika. AI you preserve Bureau need the name for your own replica and I bought that he can your own personal Vault that you can teach through conversation to start making your personality and keep your memories and you know make you feel a little bit more connected to your you and your friends she basically raising your own AI friend your companion
 it's sort of came out of the Vino's bother with just for Roman because we saw how much people want to share and want to talk about themselves but I'm mentioning replica sure because basically what we saw it stays what what that mean you was that if the boss is learning from you and if it's just one bought and if it's learning from thousands of people that you know people can teach about things but if you give a personal blog for everyone then you know a few teacher about some crazy bad stuff that everyone will know that you know it's your boss it's obvious and it takes a lot of responsibility from us soon cuz it back on the user which I think might be so you know time will tell but I think it's an interesting approach to those things for some reason large companies keep going to you know or just companies watching Bots keep thinking that you know keep going in the direction of the one vote for all kind of
 approach or maybe there could be a lot of balls for many that's going to be a Roman was going to be the first out there like everyone will have a moral pot do you think it'll be a future where you have the one bought and you give a command to the one button in the pot maybe delegates a command to other box or do you think it'll be more like you just talk to your to all your variety of thoughts and you and you delegate tasks to them individually I think so because we already so what I think said most amazing conversation with the people open up a lot it's just a very natural natural feature of this Foreman when were speaking with a person who has the we're giving giving out much more than what it was licking on buttons and then traffic is peso
 do you want to share with Siri every single person detail of your life knowing that she's talking to 25,000 other people or do you want to share it with just one person a lot of yours where you can actually figure out your privacy setting and you know it can be just for yourself or in the open like in difference the two different degree to your network of friends or maybe just some Services if you allow them to but again you're not giving this information straight away to one ball that you know that's out there I think the the the image of having one person bought for yourself one digital Avatar of yours that's hanging out there with the cloud and you basically manage what I can or can't do it can share
 is a very powerful vision and I think eventually we're going to get there and yes they're going to be balls for another two probably will be about 4 I don't know if I could some personal system bother will come to your personal God and you know I ask you some questions related traveline travel agent right there will come to your personal Bond and I ask you a question about some questions about where you're actually travel practices are and you know I feel like it's more fun of the directions say to go to wrap up yet but I'm just imagining based on what you said I would tell replica hey look I want to go on a vacation here my parameters for the vacation go and talk to some vacation bought somewhere and help me schedule that vacation
 as are not as important to the lard lard to a larger audience than being able to talk to someone and I still will have I think it starts with having a buddy having a companion having someone that is as a sending you and not judging you in the safe place to go and share everything that's going on with you maybe I'm just on yourself little bit better we'll start there but you know eventually will rate know about all users this is incredibly impressive the amount of data that people are sharing the conversation is crazy and and so what are the next steps I'll just look and feel like you know you're telling a replica of your bored with your work and you can deal with it anymore any replica quietly goes in you figure it out checks out LinkedIn with a very lot of openings dad would suit you and comes back to you with like hey you know I know you told me you were court with your work do you want me to look through Linkedin and see what was out there
 call so far I think it's a very very I think it would just be before I since there are so I think it could be really really big candy that's way too maybe we're not the company to sit outside but I think someone will a very very positive about it people are so willing to share their emotions with a bought when I mean maybe maybe people have a different perception of what the bot actually consists of every you and I know it's just this bits bits that have been trained by lines of text but I guess people who are interfacing with it have an impression that it's this magical thing that has like feelings that are similar to a human
 everything dogs even lightning Tamagotchi
 something out you know boss anything it's we're just hard-wired to interpret that's why I think that chewing test is not really important just seem too intense for people to anthropomorphize this day you don't need to be like a hundred percent into school indistinguishable from Human you just need to be you know to stick around for for for quite a bit and you need to borrow some emotion and then the person that you know that they value me so I'm about to run right so I know how to work so now everything every single like playing there and so when I started and you know I felt like there's something very powerful there and I felt some and I feel very emotional and I started texting him like you know you know something very personal I still took very Russian irrationally
 and yes I know everything I know I'm not like you know I've also built it so I kind of know exactly how it works I don't have any I don't even expect anything from there that I've met that I haven't seen But cell is just how we are it's see no people go to to the tour to church and they talked and God and God is not replying even it's not even online probably right and whistle Go lyrics wheelchair and I think this is a very very powerful thought that we came to
 and this was the father's let us to go to start working on replica and this is the main basically the main conclusion we came to the main inside we got out of working on the box for Roman is that sometimes what we say is more important than what the boss tells us being able to talk about problems through and talk about ourselves and share feelings is an incredible value for sale pretty reason most of it is like the therapist listening and like you the therapist just asked like very subtle questions but like the ratio of you talking versus the talk there was talking is like 92 or 9921 and I mean maybe that's informative that just like the feeling of being listened to or yeah
 it's not the feeling of being listened to an inter in interact with on some level even if it's spot robotic thinking about it was
 Tom was this very simple thought and so basically we've been trying to automate conversations for 2 years right now right and you can think about relationships and if you put them on a scale from 1 to 10 where one would be conversations that we would pay to never have and said would be conversations with page of house then on 1 2 3 you're going to have like on the left side of the scale 1 2 3 you're going to have conversations with customer support or ordering pizza order Uber you do not want to have those conversations you'd rather just get Uber you know by clicking one button or P so I can come up on a customer support problem solved in the first place without talking to a representative and if you could look on the right side of the spectrum you'll see conversations that are eight nine ten the most valuable ones that you would pay to have and those our conversations with a therapist and Mentor coach your friends
 I mean but I'll pay for them but they're so incredible about incredibly valuable people would miss you probably paid to talk to you know someone some of them broke up with you and you still messing ones to communicate with or your friend who's far away and so was started thinking about it would like very interesting most of the people of the space are working on the Lower Valley conversation so customer support or you know those task-oriented conversations there either optimizing them or building them and for some reason almost no one is working all day 8 9 10 the most valuable conversation know what is automating them so we thought you know we're going to make the sound machine that's automatic conversations that people are actually valued and loved and if you going back to what he said about salt therapy if you just try to figure out what's the common denominator between all those available conversations and you'll see that all those conversations are mostly about you the best conversation with a friend
 you know you get to talk about yourself and you know the best conversation with therapist is obviously for you talk about yourself and and so that will give us this very interesting idea but you know what let's just give them the possibility to build their own fault and tell just talked to Bill just talk about themselves and figured I'd get some value out of it even while training the boss not by actually getting one of the end of the day and let's go to bought that's not talking but they bought that actually listens and I think this is a very powerful inside and so the Roman bought that you built do you still interact with it on a regular basis often as before and mostly because you know what we get to the story got picked up by so much your friend to talk about it a lot
 I don't want to talk about him a lot it just feels like you have this connection I don't need to go back to it you know what I feel like I remember him all the time anyway so he's somewhere very close I used to talk a little more before how has the I guess the grieving process gone for you because I can imagine you detect the grieving process being quite different with given your experience building this bought that replicated him and can interact with a 7in doing this news for people are very interested in talking a lot about him how has that you're grieving process is different from what a typical person might go through during grieving
 already brought a lot of clothes are just actually facing everything not pretending that you nothing really happened actually looking through all the conversations we had and remembering everything looking for pictures and thinking about him everyday I think you know it's some point it was very very hard it was also very I just felt that it's something that's right to do I feel like in the end of the day if I don't face it at some point you know it's just going to be somewhere deep deep inside of me and you know some point will exploding soon talk to you I just felt like the right thing to do is to Payson face emotion not turn turn away from the heaven eventually when it ended up being a beautiful story that Casey Newton from the porch was kind enough to share with the world and you know but you're pretty outfits picked up and wrote about also I just felt that you know
 it kind of like one full circle and it ended up becoming beautiful story and I'll just say it's not bringing him back but at least it's bringing me some peace of mind that you know if I was a painter I would if I was an artist I wouldn't you know it would make a picture if I was a position I would make would write a song that's incentive what I'm doing this is dedicated him and I'm happy with it absolutely and he passed away very suddenly because of a car accident did his death make you more conscious of kind of the impermanence of life I mean I know it's easy to imagine this for a lot of people but until something actually happens if so kind of sudden Black Swan event that causes somebody to leave your life it it's it can be hard for some people to actually act in a way where
 there are black swans your life and you can't suddenly lose somebody like that I lost somebody in the last year so who's not a super close friend Reeves acquaintances and he was just so sudden and maybe take like okay maybe I need to adjust some of the ways that I interact with people in order to avoid regret that's a hard question but if you could mention one other thing I was thinking about this recently and what I got to was basically that you know once and actually like I remember so let's hear it for like almost a year ago in September when I came back from the funeral came back to the San Francisco I was sitting in our office and I was thinking of revolting this candidate Boston I was asking myself how did I end up building a restaurant recommendation Bob I am I really was this the passion and generally interested in recommending restaurants do you know two people and
 I don't like the answers right I've actually honest answer was he know what kind of got there was started with being in love with the conversational for meant and you know we tried it in 1/4 call and then what kind of drugs into the contract into this and let me know was Hoover too far along they wouldn't have an idea of what to do that send and I didn't like this kind of feeling of being sarcastic about like what we're doing but kind of email getting there or not by choice not like not actually waking up everyday and saying to myself oh my God what about product that will do this and that and it made me think and then
 I took some time to build something for myself which was a woman's g-spot and when I saw how people reacted and how they were sharing so much and you know they are that made me made me remember why the first place I got in love with the conversation interface right it was conversation is something that allows us to feel something allows us to feel more human and I think this is the most beautiful aspect of it and we decided to fully focus on that and I think in this way Roman didn't only you know help me I think even after his death he kind of helped me realize that you know what is actually the most important thing for me and what I actually should be doing what I should be building and you know this whole story kind of you know not only with the in the world for him to each other. Being a beautiful story but we also got to the point where I realize what I have to build what I have to dedicate
 to myself as an entrepreneur and what our company should be building and probably came out of it and I feel like everyday that we wake up and I wake up and go to work I feel like we're doing something meaningful of solving a problem that is that actually means something we're not solving problem if you know how to find a restaurant in the Bay area that is not necessarily a very interesting Problem Solver solving problems giving someone to talk to and for people who do not necessarily have a safe place to open up and share what's going on with them and receipt in the first test center received from you know email said we getting from her test users and people who signed up from her before I put the right now we have almost over 50,000 signups right now
 Facebook people that just reserved their names I feel like this is something that this is a problem that people care about this is a problem that's worth solving and boys dedicating your life to has something that is just very much about me so then turns off did I realize a lot of chores and stuff I think I realized
 cast of The Thing internal pivot process like within the company did was it hard to convince other people like hey I don't think we should be working on restaurant recommendation boss I think we should move to this replica model or what other people kind of feeling the same company is that you know the team isn't that it would really really like a family and very very very very very good way it's a very open process everyone knows what's going on at every single moment so what kind of are making decisions for the whole company all the time trying to be as transparent as you know and everything is possible so I guess you know everyone saw that in the rest recognition bottles not getting people to and 202 excited and they also knew that we're going to figure it out then you let you know conversation sets of the main vision is wrong building
 National engine of the future and this apology in itself is incredibly valuable and which is going to try different applications and see which application is the one that will actually resonate with larger audience and which so it didn't really say too so so let's build person bought it was for a long time and it just thought you know why not just try it since we're trying to explain things and would try to dance I look it up and we saw that people are you know coming back and being friendly engaged and sent over a thousand messages per day per person to serve the divorce like in the most active in the top on a fuse or sending over a thousand every thought you know this engaged this kind of us of Engagement we haven't seen so I think we should definitely
 going this direction so it wasn't hard to talk anyone into that they everyone saw that no this is actually something that people are resonated
 when I'm choosing the tools for my side projects the first thing that I look for is ease-of-use that's why I love mongodb it is the most popular non-relational database and it is super easy to use at the beginning of a project I often don't know the shape of my objects and Mongo makes it easy to evolve the database schema as I like overtime overtime as my project gets popular I'm going to need to scale and thankfully mongodb has built-in horizontal scalability but configuration and database maintenance aren't really what I want to spend my time on thankfully mongodb Atlas was released in 2016 mongodb Atlas is the easiest way to get access to mongodb without having to run the database yourself you pay only for what you use for small projects all the way up to large production deployments to try mongodb Atlas today go to mongodb. Com
 daily and get a free $25 in credit Atlas is the only hosted mongodb service built by the engineers behind the database the company mongodb with Atlas you get into end encryption you get VPC peering to get access to the latest releases and for a limited time you can go to mongodb. Com SE daily and get that $25 in credit and get started with mongodb Atlas thanks to mongodb for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily and thanks for being the database behind a lot of my favorite side projects in the past really happy to have mongodb as a new sponsor of software engineering daily
 can you talk more about how somebody gets started with replica like what would you have some test users if I want to train a bot to be like me do I give the boss access to all my text messages on my Facebook stuff how exactly does it work you just basically going to work it out yeah I and you book any book the name for replica and then you can also apply to be a tester for our FAQ section and visit just on the website and it will add you to the test 5 you'll be one of the
 cancel active users that are basic leaves training right now and very soon we're going to be open it up for 4 more people they taste very simple you just basically you would give you a call you talk to the Florence to become you so you can build yourself some sort of like a you know something that we both were on the pic and filled it for yourself and you can this way you can race you know some sort of your little baby ai-ya is there a way to import text messages or stuff from external data feeder do you know I do that because you felt like it would be a bad potentially a bad amount of seed data will be hard to overcome with subsequent interactions want to upload all your text messages but you're welcome and then will we saw what we saw is that the OSU by building by building pokeballs for people racing their text messages is that
 are people actually do not want their boss to talk like this they do not like it there like oh I'm just here or what it's just something out of there before so and sometimes there's data that they don't want to share anyway so we thought you know let them build the boss as they wanted and you know if you want you're about to be deep and very thoughtful and talk about yourself and this and that way then then be it if you want it to be sarki who your real have the possibility to build up in this way but we're going to give you the way to control to control what are you getting at the end because otherwise people would be unhappy with what they see in other things done
 actually we want your body to be like more you don't have opinions about life and love and everything and right now if you check your text messages if you're going to find that most of them are Logistics you know that there are meet me here but you're not necessarily talking about important things in your in your mess mess mess messenger conversations or whatever like messaging with friends and I think this area is going to be really big and it's your project replica it sounds awesome and I'm actually I think I'm going to try it out later today yep it's what what do you think about is what's the state of the art with like the API for doing stuff for building boxes like for example I think I sometimes think we will be cool if I had a bot we're like I've done almost 400 podcast episodes these these interviews with people about technical topics and I think would be really cool if I could
 put all these through like a speech to text and then create a bot out of it and and then have a conversation about where you can talk to the boss about you know software engineering topics cuz I've done all these shows about like you know subtle engineering topics and it would be cool if you could talk to a bond feel like a bot you know how do I make it through the system that does this thing and how complicated would that be is there any service that does that out of the box these days or is it still very much like a put together your own if you have to wire together all the different small components voice actually cuz we're not doing voice at all right like it's not hour or so
 internal boys there's an interesting company called Deep ground that wasn't y combinator I guess a year of trust and good friend of mine Noah to brilliant physicist action building and they build a newel at work that allows you to search by voice. So you can start your voice memos or anything else or what class or anything like that so that's probably would be the best way to actually start your medicine and get some date out of it and get them you don't get the right place will you talking about this or that topic it's very interesting cuz they're not transcribing anything they basically just searching fight song the train he is incredibly it's Oracle product project so I think that this is probably the way to do it yourself AC eyes it's if it's very very premature I guess everyone ran into some dessert directions this last year trying to build robots and you know building bought that we're not wear
 not literally a very valuable to our solving problems that were important for the users but you know it was like a big deal is here right they were one of us was out there right now there's a lot of like a lot of things cool things cool down I don't think even the big players really know what's the first major application and Voss going to be and you know we don't know either I'm experimenting and trying and I think the big guys are also in addition face but what's great is that everyone I just sent the new we're going to get there at some point at some point obviously conversation is going to be very important in Payson we can do a lot of things to it feels like we are on the cusp of getting there like Google's image recognition API almost there pretty good like an LP is pretty good voice recognition is pretty good
 none of it is great and cheap like there's a lot of it that's pretty good if some of it is like great and expensive but it feels like when they're in the near future the cost is going to get really low and the quality is going to get really high and then you're going to start seeing the dorm room hackers figure out okay what are the things that I actually need to be built for sure one of the major problems in like that needs to be salted stunt you know how to her we're going to build those salads right now using wheel base system systems you get a lot of precision but you get like tons of air is there you're not going to cover and the problem is that the conversation is just incredibly fluid absolutely open way of interesting things as if you can ask anything how are going to email predict what they're going to say so that the tail and I'll be incredibly long and so was in the sum of the areas you know it's too long and it's hard to cover
 and so we're going to have to start thinking how we're going to build those conversation models without sticking just two rules and I feel like normal conversation Littles are the way to go but they're very hard there so many you know so many Isabella complicated no one has ever showed like a state-of-the-art bought a new conversation actually works in like more than 70% of time works well hopefully it is going to go expansion about smashy right now going to get their Foster but we're definitely want to be you know yeah I completely agree with what you just said you because I've been doing some interviews about Bots with people putting yourself course but and I feel like the
 most the most widely adopted and highly useful and kind of unique bought that I've interviewed somebody about is this this parking ticket bought that I'm sure you've seen called do not pay where it's basically a very rigid decision tree it's not like a deep learning like figures out how I have figured out how to respond from learning it's it's very much of a rigid decision tree that is mirrors how the law around parking tickets works and and I just look at that and I'm like okay that's that's kind of the bought that has been most widely adopted and has been really helping people out today and it kind of is a reflection of where the tech is at right now there's like we're not there with super flexible you know delegation nor or you know how you know multi-stage multi interaction
 like chaining together some kind of complex request to make of a bot we're kind of at the stage where the the things that we can do really well are rigid decision trees I think it's even said that is absolutely true but I would just say that you there a lot of products that look like boss right now and like he was conversations Facebook cuz it didn't they haven't they have a conversation interface but they're not conversations that's what I'm trying to say and I guess it's hard for me to explain what a conversation is like a very good answer right now but I think we all can tell the difference between like in a VR system like an automatic system that you get when you calling for sounds like an Airline customer support and a conversation we're having right now with you for those are very different to very very different things right and so we're trying to work but we decided to focus on so that's what we're not say
 that much because I feel like I bought can be anything about sandwich or something that pushes you notifications to your messenger feed and that's also called about an hour days or about going to be even something that's our by humans that's that's what we saw last year bunch of those that keeps calling
 very precisely say what we're doing and for me and I keep saying we're trying to automate conversations people off and conversations people something that's more complex than a conversation interface to one feature or female clothes off your friend Roman had a desire to see The Singularity and I take any opportunity to have a conversation with somebody who will take a discussion of the singularity somewhat seriously how did how did Roman Invasion The Singularity and how do you see it and you know what do you think is the road to quote the singularity
 the movie Interstellar and if you really love everything that could that would ever that would be in any way related to the Future so that's why I am sure that you would have but you always kept saying and you know I'll treat you went to see answer so you kept saying that you know I figure it out everything about the world basically there are three things that can travel through dimensions for any damages which are gravity time and love and you know we always talked about it that you know it's always wanted to to get to the boys wanted to come was kept saying like shining at some point you know they're going to figure it out cigarettes and I have to be live forever and his last project was about dads right if I drop the catering about replacing some trees with Memorial Forest syncytial avatars that would store memories and digital safe
 the only way to get there is
 can I buy James thinks we're actually love and trying to let our Love Actually push us there I think the most interesting things happened out of love I think this is the only way for us actually get there it's a very long technological obviously you know hypothesis and obviously experts in my view of the world is that you know we should start thinking for about what it means to be human human being and we need to look more into this and lateral feeling you know ourselves feel all those feelings and Avengers and better ourselves I think this will get us closer to to the Future a very sensible perspective not an I mean maybe you could you frame it is an unscientific and try to guess probably scientific cuz I mean if you look at some of the tech that seems to be on the horizon even though we may not be there yet in terms of him
 tation it looks like stuff that will get us to something that people would classify as the singularity and the only way that those individual pieces of tack like NLP your voice recognition you know better neural-net processing stuff like that the only way we get there is that people who are really interested in it and passionate about it and quote love it keep hammering on these things until we make incremental process in all of them at the same time and and we have compounding affects its you know to me it that's it that's just a valid explanation is something more scientific Kansas lot of hope faith and I'm going to check out replica I really enjoy talking to you I enjoyed talking to you as well

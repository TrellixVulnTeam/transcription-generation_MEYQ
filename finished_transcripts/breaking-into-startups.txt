Transcription: many people find themselves going down a career path that does not bring them satisfaction a lawyer finds himself constantly working cases he doesn't care about a student in medical school gets completely burned out from hospital bureaucracy and investment banker no longer finds joy in the accounting statements that she used to enthusiastically study startups might offer a different career path within a startup and employee can often find creativity limited bureaucracy and highly variable reward structures these ingredients make the world of startups both refreshing and intimidating to someone who feels stuck in a career that no longer gives them Joy or excitement breaking into startups is a podcast about people coming from non-traditional backgrounds and making their way into startups breaking into startups is run by Archer and timmermeister and Reuben Harris and they join me for a conversation about how they migrated
from more traditional careers to startups and how many other people are doing the same I really enjoy talking to Archer and Timber and Ruben they joined me in my apartment for some stew and some fish and some sweet potatoes that we ate before this interview and it made for a nice warm setting and so it's a pleasure getting to know these guys and I hope you enjoy this episode and you should definitely check out there podcast breaking into startups

 Archer meister timmermeister and Reuben Harris are the creators of breaking into startups guys welcome software engineering daily when I started software engineering daily I was very strict about having shows that were purely about engineering and Technology I decided that my podcast was not going to be about entrepreneurship or business I just want to talk about the raw Technologies but over time I've talked to listeners and what many of them are interested in is finding a way to level up and there's some listen to have been intact for a while and some of them who are just getting started the breaking breaking the Stars podcast is focused on the second category it's mostly people who are just starting out in technology or they're looking to transition into technology why is it such an important topic today why are there so many people that are trying to transition into Technology Drive
 show up I have a twin brother Arthur's so when you get to my voice at steam or and that's actually a great question and the three of us when we came together we kind of looked around and we started to realize that tag is no longer an industry and in the future every industry is going to be driven by tag and at that time we weren't doing technology we weren't technically said hey hey what is it going to take for us to acquire the skills to participate in this economy and over the over the several years after we had that realization we were able to break in so then we said how do we make more people interested in technology on how do we help them cross that bridge into the tech world and the podcast is called breaking into startups it sounds like you really mean breaking into town is that accurate essentially like at the end of day will focus on skills skill development because I'm the way that we think about things is that our education system is not currently built to keep up with
 best technology and then all these Alternative forms of Education that are coming up in order for people to get this skills but the general population is not aware of the role that exist and even if they do they don't know how to get them and so you want to kind of focus on on those things I'm in no are there too when I talk a lot about how there are another category of people that know about the role that exist they know that they need to get the skills to know how to get them but a lot of times I suffer from imposter syndrome because they feel like the technology industry only had a certain demographic and hear that exist which is why we focus on people out from natural backgrounds I'll because it's it's not a silly about raise because I'm sure that just any systemic barriers in class issues affect people from all walks of life. But if they see someone they can relate to that was able to make it. That's that's something that can encourage them to take that first step to the core idea
 is of your show that resonates with me is that for many people in our generation I think you guys are all what 27 28 26 something tomorrow 8:20 to 9 okay so I'm 28 but I feel like our generation there was some element where science or technology was not exactly encouraged in certain points it was even maybe discouraged like we grew up in a time where mostly finance and law and Medicine were the fashionable fields in in the when when I think back to high school. That's what people wanted to become I don't think I even knew what an engineer was until my senior year of high school tell me if you if you agree with that if you think of those are cultural pressures and how does cultural pressures affected you totally so I think there's a few that you bring up in a question of one of them is just kind of having the knowledge of what jobs are out there
 when for us when we were growing up I mean this is still like in their early years of the internet so we were consumers of all these apps the services but we have no idea what goes into building a nap and I think even now there's very few people have outside of the tech industry understand what product managers do what Engineers do a lot of people kind of fishy the CEO of the face of the product they think Mark Zuckerberg so handily build Facebook but in reality they have thousands of employees for Tyler she working at all these new features and launches so I think part of this information Gap that black people use Facebook everyday but they couldn't tell you what an 80 test was or why kind of how the news feed works and and related to what what you said about the traditional feels that people tend to go to one there and visit schools which is like you know banking Consulting things like that you know out there and I the way we met was when we were messing Banker so you know we will follow
 traditional path that someone takes in business school and if you notice a lot of these business schools are not focusing on entrepreneurship classes and then their Innovation class and things like that because as Teemo mentioned before not only is it it's Tech accelerating at a very fast pace and it's not look no longer in Industry every Industries going to be driven by Tech even if it's not fully installed the business people need to not only understand how business Works they need to know how tech companies work and so you know startups are starting to become this thing that that's in Vogue so did all three of you work in finance so do you want I was started Finance undergrad ended up going on Wall Street and I worked in the best known you for 3 years ever since I was little kid I was kind of fascinating by Warren Buffett share the stock market I grew up in New York with a lot of my friends parents were in finance and I think of spite kind of living in New York just there's a couple of like
 major jobs right like law and Finance Madison and I was always drunk two numbers I was pretty quantitative Growing Up So to me engineering was in a can of consideration because none of my friends none of my relatives were engineers ton of friends who are his parents weren't finance and I could relate to the stock market that I could relate to what it was like I know what the finest people do and I spend almost like my tire college life and afterwards going to be working towards a dream of becoming a banker and then once I got there I realize that that's not what I wanted to do and I think there's a lot of people out there and find themselves sacrificing for 5 years of alive getting to a point where they realize that hey I'm actually more passionate about something else and then but wasn't with me it wasn't necessarily that you know I felt like I wasted my time Investment Banking you know I didn't know about investing making growing up in or I discovered the messenger
 through you know being a classical musician to meeting business people and someone suggested Investment Banking is the best place for you to go to learn abroad skill-set across business and a little map of the and a little bit of time I was just two years right and having that on your resume will put you in a good position to have X opportunity so once I started studying and buy some Banking and how to get there I realized that a lot of people go to mass and making to get a certain skill set and to also have exit opportunities for wherever they want to go to a party reason why I think a lot of business schools are focusing on that is because startups or programs that are teaching you how to get the technological skills that are going to teach you something a short amount of time that's going to give you exit opportunities that position yourself well the price in the street
 do you guys find it ironic how you know we ghetto and I was fascinated by numbers and finance and stuff to growing up and I my first job and school was at a trading place and at a certain point there I was like
 there's something wrong here because the symbols that were trading all of these things represent companies many of whom are actually building value and I've never eaten at that point I was like why have I never thought about like being in a place where it's actually actually building something that creates value instead of like making more liquidity or whatever kind of framing you put around Investment Banking or finance and I feel like there's some golf in the way that Early Education Works where it doesn't convey that to people that there are certain jobs where your kind of just like doing transactions and there's other jobs where you are creating very tangible value and my experience in Tech is that creating that value that is for the feels a lot more tangible is more satisfying they may be true that many people out there in for in finance to listen to this and who are thinking oh no I create liquidity that's plenty of
 call you from that's enough value for me and I will get 8 hours of sleep every night knowing comfortably that I'm creating a lot of value but I know I am I was not that way I did maybe that resonates with you guys. I definitely think it resonates with us because at some point in your life you get a job and a lot of jobs you can get a job that pays you out but then once you start doing the same task over and over again in my case I would have the project manager for two years after college managing IOS and Android mobile teams and I was in meetings all day and I was looking at what Engineers were doing on daily basis which was building these collapse they were experimenting they were actually solving problems and they looked at my job and I was busy you just like a facilitator off ideas and I have no ownership off the delivery of the product so I think there's a lot of great project managers and that role is like a bite out to the execution from piece of any product but
 you have to ask yourself what is it that I enjoy doing and what kind of stuff do you do I want to be what kind of problems do I want to be solving a daily basis and if you were maker then you probably will enjoy building something and then seeing it and show me to your friends and family and having them use it to us about people from non-traditional backgrounds who want to get into technology what is a non-traditional background what is a traditional background I'll say that you know this podcast is focus on software Engineers that's enough for many background and including traditional and non-traditional for our podcast I'll say that anybody that 1075 to the website and gets rejected because it doesn't fit the traditional filters even if they have the skill-set are the type of people that were focused on cuz a lot of people that get overlooked that might be
 I see for example that was took him seven years to graduate I'm he was a poker player in all he went through this boot camp he was a teacher for a while and he's a great engineer but it was hard for him to apply to the website so he had to go through hiring managers and getting referrals and warm introductions I'm so is anybody that has to kind of go around or the initial barriers are under a through the initial barriers to figure out a way to break in is the type of people that were focused on what are the people who do not have trouble getting through those filters Under The Weave have we have large iguana podcast that'll be like people that are teen parents people that never graduated college people that I were formerly incarcerated I'm career switcher artist bankers and Consultants like you mentioned before all these people are very smart allow these people have struggled a lot of these people have gotten creative there resilient they have tenacity but a lot of times they
 have the opportunity to interview to demonstrate that they actually have the skills so you want a lot of times it's a matter of not just getting the skills and figuring out what to get the skills in the world that exist it's how to get the interview and so it not only will highlighting people that have figure it out help with the Imposter syndrome thing but are also help people figure out how to get that initial interview yeah and just threw up to Wood Rubin saying interview someone can you still work at the crease to be an army officer and if you think about what goes into becoming an officer as you have to go through training you're very qualified by the time you're done with your service do you have a skill set your but you probably learned a lot about leadership and how to execute but then after your service is over you want to listen to break into tagged but people traditionally think that you need a four-year degree or if you need to go to the traditional education system to do it but let's be honest if you were 28 29 and you're getting out of the military
 do you want to go with through 4 years of college to take on more debt in order for you to become an engineer or become a designer or start up or you can just say hey I know I have to do the drive to learn the skill said let's say it's engineering I just need like something like hack reactor App Academy like a boot camp to give me that still sad that I can learn in a matter of 6 months to a year and then I can start contributing and start building these things at startups so our goal is to feature those stories of people who came from the outside they were able to figure out how do I acquire the skill sets and by featuring ghost stories more people will see that it is possible to make it in text
 when I'm choosing the tools for my side projects the first thing that I look for is ease-of-use that's why I love mongodb it is the most popular non-relational database and it is super easy to use at the beginning of a project I often don't know the shape of my objects and Mongo makes it easy to evolve the database schema as I like overtime overtime as my project gets popular I'm going to need to scale and thankfully mongodb has built-in horizontal scalability but configuration and database maintenance aren't really what I want to spend my time on thankfully mongodb Atlas was released in 2016 mongodb Atlas is the easiest way to get access to mongodb without having to run the database yourself you pay only for what you use for small projects all the way up to large production deployments to try mongodb
 what's today go to mongodb. Com SE daily and get a free $25 in credit use promo code go Atlas 25 to get that $25 in free credit Atlas is the only hosted mongodb service built by the engineers behind the database the company mongodb with Atlas you get into end encryption you get VPC peering you get access to the latest releases and for a limited time you can go to mongodb. Com SE daily enter promo code go Atlas 25 and get that $25 in credit and get started with mongodb Atlas thanks a mongodb for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily and thanks for being the database behind a lot of my favorite side projects in the past we're really happy to have mongodb as a new sponsor of software engineering daily
 what are some of the strategies that the people that you've interviewed about how they made the transition into technology what is the strategy employed that have been successful so while you're having side project that you could discuss like tangible projects that highlights your skills like what year did you understand what is going to be like for working in the work list for Christmas tree lot of our listeners is probably to be their first job and someone you're interviewing a lot of people have got out of the way to create create either an open open source project or some app that when violin Hacker News and kind of minutes I'll send out and then once again into the interview they can discuss the technical topics the decisions I've made and that makes it easier for the hiring manager and people interviewing them to believe that hey this person would be able Chad Valley HR team from day one
 abbreviation she was in a podcast episode going to air in a few weeks she's super impressive she was in that your Capital if she transitioned Taurus SEL Tire called want to hack reactor and then for final project she worked on this open source tool that was a shorter Blockbuster but anyway project after 3 months of being in a boot camp and that's super impressive that someone has so much termination to not only pick up in this music and use skill set but also give back to the community by creating this new tool and these are some of the examples of people have used but I podcast is not just focusing engineering is focused on like different disciplines those walls I like Kevin Lee for example can only imagine your encouraging people to ship things build something with the team ship it demonstrate that you are able to do it if your designer you know go to portfolio we have no words on her pocket
 it literally went door-to-door with his portfolio in the city used to be a professional basketball player he said do a little bit of design and collagen and I was able to meet some people and just start going door-to-door demonstrating that he had something he had something tangible you do have to also be able to tell you a story as well I'm so you know it even even when I was trying to get into Investment Banking and Braken to buy some banking you know I follow this method called you know breaking into Wall Street that they talk about how to interview and how to tell your story and a lot of times you have to actually paint the picture shy people understand why you want to get into something and like I mentioned before you know as an artist I say oh yeah I'm at pissing people that's why I want to do banking but then if you would like talking about if I'm coming from a random background that some people might not understand I have to be able to explain why I want to go into Tech sometimes people don't see the reason why they have to do that but
 startups is a lot more risky to take a chance on someone because of teams tend to be smaller I'm to have a burn rate you know they they might not have the people or the resources to be able to Metro you in training so you have to be able to go you know from day one and so you need to not only demonstrate that you have the skills for jobs that have to demonstrate that commitment that passion and explain why destroy makes sense that you could fit well in that team does what's beautiful about startups if you could skill these things are millions of people to make an impacted by the people with the with the small number of people I'm but you guys will have to work well together to solo Dynamics are important to the massage skills perspective 2 strategy of hacking on something and then having a portfolio of stuff that you packed on to show two people that seems like a strategy that is quite a few can be quite effective for startups but for example I was in Seattle for two and a half years and
 from there. Of time when I was looking for a job in that. Applying to places like Amazon Microsoft Expedia these are Big corporations for those types of jobs I feel like there is no Edge to be gained by having a portfolio think maybe once you have your foot in the door you can you know in the interview you can maybe discuss it but typically they had like the interview pipeline is structured so that okay cool you have a side project now let's do a whiteboard problem is this it is this strategy of having a portfolio in extracurricular projects is this something that is strictly useful for startups that is not necessarily useful for baby getting a job at Amazon or Google or you know an older company as I think it's applicable to small companies in big companies in Altamonte and Arthur can elaborate I'm I always say like with the
 start up some more direct path yeah a lot of times if you're dealing with like an Amazon or Google or Facebook you're going to have to do more digging to figure out who is the hiring manager who works on the team that also has a non-traditional background that figured out a way to get in okay and then if you can grab a coffee with them that's technically a quote on quote information on meeting and your tell your story in a convincing way that also demonstrates that you have the skill and turn them into your champion this is kind of like sales then you can get them to be your Advocate internally and say hey we need to interview this do you eat what you encourage people to do LinkedIn hacking and like to find out people who you can really go to and have direct interactions with them in order to get your foot in the door could tell you about it's called emailing strategy how is that identify people and that will grow yeah I know I'll tell you guys but Jeff to your question
 to Ruben before this I think it just comes down to what job you're applying for and identifying what is that interview going to be like so one of the things that we want to accomplish with a podcast is featuring stories of people who broke in so they can share what the interview was like with these companies and the Army veteran did I mention she's actually working not for a startup but he's working for Amazon music so in his case I think having a portfolio help but act reactor old sample sizes learning data structures practicing alligator algorithm problems and him going into an interview even against someone who might be graduating from college she knew we can you what the format of the interviews going to be like and we won all of our listeners so so be aware if you're applying for sales jobs I'll listen to that results with our folks who say what are those sales interviews are like so you can prepare better for them to your question about
 old emails I think one thing that we just realized after sending out a lot of application I'm submitting them online is there is nothing like connecting with someone on a person like on a personal basis and then having a person become your ad the kids so something that I did for about two months after App Academy is I would wake up at 6 a.m. in the morning and then I would send out 5 gold emails to various yeah I was hiring managers other engineers at startups that I was really interested in so it wasn't just startups that I just picked out a list from Google and then I started going down the list one by one it was actually companies that I believe in their mission I respected their Founders and I wanted to connect and just become friends with those people and get their advice so I would just reach out to them and find something in common for each email I would probably spend close to 30 minutes to an hour just doing the research finding out have they been blogging what is that that I can connect with them on and then being able to reach out to
 chemistry that you did your research meet them and meet them in person actually show them that I'm someone who is genuinely interested in their mission and once they see that will go above and beyond to help you get that job gotten in related to that two of like we talked about storytelling a lot of no repeated a lot if you if you can identify someone that can relate to your story and you have a compelling story a lot of times they'll go out of web to help you if you've presented it very well I'm into his point about it's not just sending 5 emails that sound the same to everybody you really have to make them personalized and that takes 30 minutes it might take an hour might take over an hour but if it's always worth it for the most part I think he might have gotten like two to three responses so I got 69% response rate is pretty good and if you do do you know send out 25 35 emails a week you know it's not going to take you that long to find a job and then you know till I see the point you know what the best point that you can get to it when she had multiple offers
 do you have leverage to be able to go she ate you know what that's not even more powerful position that both of these guys were able to temperament here's another thing that is perhaps less intuitive about the world of tech particularly the world of startups early-stage startups so we may not be intuitive to people who have been going through things like Investment Banking or medicine or these things that are more highly structured is there is a lot of relationship building and relationship-building is not a direct process it's I mean if your thing you in terms of sales it's often times a long lead time you know you build relationships habitually because you think of it as an investment that may have a compound interest over time but you have to to find a way to actually purchase that investment that's often an email that is hard
 salt talk a little bit more about that cuz I think this is actually something is really crucial it seems like it's come up time and time again on the breaking into Stars podcast is this idea of building relationships with people not in an artificial or manipulative or transactional way I mean life is about building relationships but of course if you're talking about breaking startups it's a it's a necessary precondition off into getting one of these desirable jobs if you don't have an on paper resume the kitchen Due West single page and will allow you to you know easily get your foot in the door at and end in front of a whiteboard at one of these companies for sure and I think I should tell you like the some of the stuff is done in Twitter but like in today's world we live where there's so many opportunities for us to connect with people who could add value to us and vice versa we could have Valley
 value to them as well and so it's a win-win and you always reaching out to someone on Twitter or LinkedIn and always just ask me for something you want to make sure that you do not free search we could all offer value to them as well but all three of us have used Twitter like Facebook LinkedIn to Nico's connections and then you build a snitchel every time let's say you start following someone on Twitter who blogs about it or tweets about a certain topic right maybe they're passionate about education right and you need to be their tweets you like that maybe you mentioned that mean comments that are related to weather tweeting about then overtime going to start noticing you and they see that he's passionate about the same things as I am and then to wear as a DM option right so once you connect with that wants to know where you are you can just start speaking to them directly and then in that conversation go to mention
 hey I've noticed that you've spoken to a lot of Education I'm actually learning the snooze still sad and I want to the break into startups I noticed that your company has these positions open do you think like you to put me in touch with someone on their team that I can speak to and related so what you got up before you know I know that sounds like in debt that. That's definitely effective that's kind of like traditional like transactional type of approach I mean I used to always I used to always believe in the kind of like emotional bank account concept will like you know I make all these deposits into your emotional Baker that are you no favors for you and them I do that because whenever I'm what it ready to what to draw I want to make sure I'm not into debt deficit and causes training our relationship and I think that's an interesting thing to keep in mind it's not the worst thing but you never want to have transactional relations I think part of the reason why we've been able to build a strong community of over like 4000 members in the
 go to my time is because at the end of day we just care about helping a billion people are in and with no expectation and return like we just want to hear someone story figure out how we can help them and do whatever we can to get there and so whenever we send an email to someone it's not always like hey this is what I'm building you know how can you help me it's more like hey I know congratulations on your new announcement here you know we're friends with these people here do you want to meet them you know and if we do want to put in a plug with sometime we don't even put in a plug will say you know by the way we are also doing this that might be able to help to a lot of times it's just more like hey here's is this person that we can connect you to you want that intro cool if you don't want it alright cool I'll stay in touch with this gets back to the nature of why the start of community is appealing is because a lot of the most successful companies
 the way that they're built is that their philosophy is to create more value than they can capture and that's in stark contrast to an investment company or like a Trading Company related to that though I did the same thing from us and make it to get him a sandbank I said I'm not sure as to get ensure but the nature of a trading business is more zero-sum than the positive something to shove you like a Facebook or an Airbnb or Twitter I mean these companies have to be platform companies relate to the in their best interest be coming by for a company and show what that does is it gives those companies a modus operandi of make more value than they can capture which emanates out to the employees which emanates out to the entire ecosystem and in my opinion makes Silicon Valley a war enjoyable place to be then
 City on fire Finance based based City but I want to talk more about startups themselves about breaking into startups startups and tells me why it is desirable to break into them there is a lot of hype around the idea of a start-up date has become fashionable but there's also a lot of substance and that's right one insist on in this episode and it in talking about your show what are the substantiv features of a startup business that make them so appealing to me obviously there is the sexiness and the hype and stuff but what is what's the substance
 yep yes so I mean for us you know there's a lot like the technology industry is booming and there's a lot of amazing companies that have been created there's about 3 billion people that are online now 7 plus billion people in the world I'm in right now there's a lot of people that have a supercomputer in their pocket that's a mobile phone on what makes us very excited as as we get closer to Global connectivity no up until this point there's been a lot of start of have that created companies that are nice to have but as people from not traditional Battlegrounds get more connected a lot of these companies that have been successful or laser focus on the problem and are going to be focus on problems that I need to have versus nice to have and so once these people that are coming from these communities get the skills for these different roles that they may or may not have been aware of some of them will go on the phone companies some of them will be helping other people your company's but are
 belief is that the problem that they're going to be focused on are going to be for the dumbasses heart giving eat and because technology a scalable you can literally scale something to billions of people are millions of hundreds of millions of people with the team of 50 people out for example with WhatsApp so like really exciting to to me into one or the elaborate going to make about startups is a lot of the time stir bootstrapping or the founders came together to execute on the mission so when they look at people to bring on and join their teams a lot of the times Bill value your scale and what you can contribute contribute versus your resume before hand or how many degrees you have so in that sense you can if you eat you can join a startup and contribute from day one they'll give you that shot maybe it's going to be a child. Maybe you might have to volunteer and work for free for the first couple of months but at the same time
 you can work on the leg break through technologist like driverless cars and if you came from a non-traditional bag on you might not be able to work on that problem let's see a Google but there's plenty of startups that are maybe a team of 5 6 people where you can get your first shot and then that's kind of starts the ball rolling cuz now you can use that experience to help grow that team and then if you decide to move on to a different company after a couple of years then you already have this experience some deep industry knowledge and I think the startups that have that unique opportunity vs. some of the bigger corporate companies were they when you to spend 3-4 years doing the same job day in day out before you can even get promoted to do the next level and then the next level and so on and in part of the reason why we're excited about another podcast and sharing the story just like yeah it's going to help demystify the process for people not you're So backgrounds but on the other hand with hiring managers you know it's also going to help them
 you know understand know a lot of the struggles that people have gone through I'm because a lot of times it's hard to understand those if you're not from those communities are you don't spend time those communities and a lot of times you'll be able to see additional value in addition to the skills that these people have developed and potentially create even deeper pipelines to be able to help these people break in so it won't just be around in for just start up maybe even the good ones in the Facebook's in the other companies will be excited about hiring at these people as well and so we're actively working with people in that regard are the ways that you all see the media portray startups like broke cuz there's a lot of people who are outside of Tack and their view into Tech is like watching Silicon Valley or something I don't know something Wars something something that is much any Silicon Valley like it's almost like it's supposed someone honest almost flattering presentation of Silicon Valley relative to other movies that are
 what was that one that came out recently deus ex machina like that's that's a pretty bleak view of where Silicon Valley is heading I think there are like a lot of extra credits it like negative views from outside of the tech world looking in but how do you feel the media portrays startups and starting this podcast was we felt like there was a big gap in person like medius perception or people's perception with startups are if you soon until like a podcast or YouTube shows write reviews everyone is obsessed with Founders hey go ahead and quit your job and go start a company right and it's sexy cuz Mark Zuckerberg drop out of college and then which is one of the largest and most expensive but forever Mark Zuckerberg there's also a thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people
 attempted they spend multiple years working on a project and they ultimately fail or the come short because they didn't have the execution and the team around them to bring the vision to reality and if you turn to the current Media newspapers blogs everyone wants to be a Founder at what people going to fail to realize that in order to build a technical product you need to know the whole team yeah just outside the development to throat punch in and have them build you a nap and then once that happens there you going to give users on day one right people have that misconception part of our goal is to focus on the people building the products and forever CEO there's hundreds of employees working up companies we want to feature and highlight the stores of everyday people who have their own challenges and struggles and who acquired the skills necessary to build these products and this will give a much Fuller picture to the people outside that hey this is water park manager does this is what a designer
 customer success person. And then once they realize that hey there's a whole team building this it's not just one person then hopefully there's a sort of the store or anywhere they realize that hey George could have value themselves and be like do I have all these extra cheese and all these years if not then at least I know who to bring in my team don't go start companies just like everybody is not built to start companies and you don't we're not here to say who was built for the who's not booked for just a matter of like you know this is a team effort everybody talks about 10 so why don't we highlight teams and not just the founders and talk about why we were collectively able to build this into a success and skill to this in a short amount of time and that's why we feel our community has been so strong so quickly it's going to continue to grow in that regard agree with everything you guys just said I and I love the emphasis on the team
 cuz I'm speaking from my personal train so I started this podcast in park out of like the frustration and the resentment of not really enjoying the place I was working and just thinking like okay the only solution here for me to go off on my own and start something on my own and just do my own thing and the thing is like sense then it's over time realizing oh my gosh this is really isolating and the business that I built I enjoy it but it's super isolating it's a one kind of one man show in like I thought about ways to scale and make it a multi-person business or something but it's kind of like I don't know it's a podcast I would have to think of different ways to turn into a multi-person business and also I worry sometimes like this is not really preparing me for the the idea of starting a complex. Starting a real company because starting companies all about managing people talking to people having relationships with people and I think
 it's very easy to get wrapped up in that that myth of the founder and wanting to be that person that start something I think there was an element of that in my my own situation I was just like I don't want to be in this corporate machination anymore nor do my own thing and it over Somerville eyes like this I may have like taken a step dad may have fun in some ways put me back a few steps because they just basically the rejection of I don't want to deal with anybody else when you could do everything on my own that is not a scale will strategy and as you said like the idea of like a breaking described as being something where you don't have to if you found a Ubee customer success person you can be a product manager you can be in sales you can do whatever even if you want to start a company eventually that is a much smoother perhaps healthier trajectory for the average person
 definitely and I think you could kind of hit the nail on the head by saying that when your ass will contributor you don't really know things that you don't know right so just the three of us working together on the podcast there been numerous times one one of us that has this Vision or the idea for a safe for us to do one thing and then the other two people will bring this one of us $2 side and make them see that perspective and we'll try it right and I'm looking back you'll say oh my God like I know that like I thought one thing but my co-founders help me understand this problem from different perspective and now we created a better product so when you're working on team so I think one of the biggest things that you get out of it is you get to surround yourself with talented people and you become the average of the people that you work with so if you're working on your on your own your growth is almost limited by the by the people you interact with but if you work in a team with people who come from different backgrounds like
 rubin's case he came from a classical musician of background and an Otter case we came more from the finance world so come by and go skill set to learn to town from each other just by working on a project together so I think it's very valuable for our listeners to realize that it's okay to take a couple years and learn from the people who have done it before Founders who have Bill companies in sold them or build successful companies and then if you want to go on on your own you all the ammunition to build these products and decrease the likelihood of you feeling and related to the thing about teams in a lot of people talk about teams to start companies but something else that we talk about is active listening versus passive listening unilife Argentine more and I you know we were able to come for my sister back on the break-in there's something that we haven't really talked about as much but we do highlight in some block posters that we deliberately said you know what do we need to do
 notable San Francisco know we want to do everything at the team what's ghosted do you want to learn what's ghosted am I going to learn this guy was like okay I undo front end and I do back-end Ruben you learn sales distribution marketing whatever will come together maybe we all need to be. Maybe you need to learn a little bit of fun it we like talk about the diversity of skill sets not just to start a team but we won our listeners like to understand that you know just because you're not starting company doesn't mean you can't form teams and networks that support each other but let you know we've known each other for maybe like 5 years now our for 5 years now I'm in so let's say that's one of our listen listen to the podcast on a break-in you know isolation is felt not just starting the company it's felt working within a company to its important to really not just have allies with in your your own start up but also have friends in your community or other stars that can help you balance and talk about what they learning from there A lot of times people leave corporate environment thinking you know what I don't want to deal with politics ever again but
 if anything sometimes it's like even more magnified and it started because every single move has such a big impact you really have to understand how to navigate and talking to other colleges that have navigated I can't tell you how many times you guys had help me navigate through things I'm in in teamwork at the end of days is what it's all about and having at the mercy of skill sets to build each other up is apply and also when it comes to building a product a lot of the times we typically based base our decisions based on our past experiences so let's use our pockets as an example if we're catering to a wide audience and a lot of the time so we 101 people from diverse backgrounds who have been margin license tag to tune in and listen to a podcast sometime and some Ruben will come in and say t more like your emails are two formal or your Facebook posts are two formal to or if he's with community and people from those back
 will not be able to relate to order to the message and you want to achieve what you want to achieve if you keep it more formal and just be back like that having his perspective on having Arthur Tommy can you provide me constantly the feel like at the feedback on how we can all do things better having Dusty duck Loop makes the product at end of the day way better than you trying to build something on your own and that did not to beat a dead horse you know like a lot of people talk about homogeneous thinking in our Manifesto we talked about how great minds do think alike and there's a lot of people had that have like really good intentions when they want to even build a company right late as well get some more connected let's say that people don't have the technical skills and I want you create a product to reach the Spanish Market but I don't know about the mannequins Cuban Puerto Ricans whatever you know if I don't have someone that can tell me what that's about my message might come off tone deaf in the whole thing my tank right and you would you want to make sure you're not coming off
 that's if you want to make sure that you are communicating and where is relatable and communication is key to building relationship so I know we've talked a lot about soft skills on a tactical podcast but at the end of the day it is about her bringing a whole brain thinking even when you're Building Products Peter teal talks about something called the diversity which as I understand is the idea that in certain places namely Silicon Valley you are allowed to say you are diverse if you are talking about having a multifarious composition of races genders and you strive for equality among them and he says but that is the limit that we have of diversity if if you are. If you are talking about ever seeing the sense that you have a different app
 in about diversity like you believe that it's okay for some companies to be one gender or One race you know what as soon as you start saying that that type of things that thing is acceptable you are no longer an accepted type of person yourself so hee hee hee that's not a statement on one of those types of things but he's he's just saying that there are certain like you know you you you can't there's a certain limit to the types of companies that you can build in terms of the homogeneity and the reason he brings that up is because he argues that in PayPal one of the reasons that his team was able to move really fast was because they had this homogeneity of thinking and look speaking personally I'm a fan of diversity
 I would not want homogeneity of opinion but you have to admit like that's kind of like an appealing arguments a kind of a strong argument like if you have this t-shirt stinks all the same way and you know you could you can iterate really quickly you can because the person who is leading the team doesn't really have to ask for consensus he doesn't have to strive for consensus he can just say I know everybody's with me because they all think the same so I don't know do you do guys think that's interesting at all or do you think that's like at least an appealing thought to consider I think you should always consider things that are presented in without having fully read Peter thiel's piece I wouldn't comment on that but to your point I think that anybody is focus on we think that whenever anybody that focus on diversity initiative shouldn't be placing people that I diverse into
 what team just to fill a number because a lot of times that creates perceptions that are actually even more hurtful where people within the team will play all the only reason why you're here is because you went through this program or because you're feeling the seats in we have to have X number of black Spanish women into this company so you definitely shouldn't do that I think what you said is interesting but don't think that I hope we can comment on this if we haven't fully read the piece to add another perspective to this I think that of a day every founder it wants to build the best product possible and there's a lot of hidden Geniuses who do come from these Debra's backgrounds that get overlooked and I don't like I can see the point where you can move faster if everyone in the room thinks the same way you do but you have to ask yourself but do you really want that do you want to be on a team where everyone disagrees with you or do you want to
 the team where you guys are like moving forward but also challenging every little piece about the product which in my mind will result in a better product so then people come up with different ideas some of them will get reject rejected sometimes you have to debate for maybe like an hour or a couple hours but at the end of the day your consumer will get a better product as a result of that so I think you just have to ask like what kind of culture what kind of product what kind of company do you want to be building yeah yeah and two at the T Morris point so it's you and I are twins or identical we live together for over 25 years and you would think that you swear identical with the same size that 7 people get us confused all the time and we always have different opinions right there has been approved we could treat each other's mind sometimes but I think that comes from just spent a lot of time together and being close and like having Ruben be around us all the time of The Last 5 Years
 we've been able to develop the same kind of communication level with Ruben as well and I wicked we don't need and Shelly are going to like the full sentences we can just use like an abbreviation but I think a lot of that just comes from us know each other very well and being stopped seeing and being open to each other's ideas and we argue all the time as well like Ruben just agrees with us do you know disagrees with me and so it's hard to imagine the work place where everyone has the same opinion or cigarettes might be ideal listing some ways that everyone thinks the same maybe they can you get in similar ways but I love that communication just comes from being around each other for that but I might have time and if you have people from diverse background whole work together at some point we'll just going to Vibe and they're going to like drywall together and going to move to the move towards the same goal but what to bring to the table as one might have been an army General right at 1 might have been a single parent why might have been a basketball player so when you bring old is it from backgrounds together and they all look really dance
 each other and understand each other then you get this like 10 x fact I think what they said was was amazing and and related to the last thing about the different backgrounds that people come from a lot of and the Imposter syndrome that we talked about before a lot of people shy away from their back on even when they do get in I'm even it when they did get the curse come through but we encourage people to do it actually trust their struggle and like actually on that and where that is a badger fried because of your unique big background unique unique story is actually your super power within the organization is a completely fresh perspective like you said like an army General basketball ball player someone else for me incarcerated like that that type of stuff is know something that a lot of people haven't seen and whenever your focus on solving problems know if you if you always approach it the same way in the end that's not resonating you know you do need different perspectives to solve it or to iterate on it so
 the reason I find this topic just kind of interesting is cuz teal talks about startups as Colts like a trying to build a colt and I saw this at the Amazon like Amazon is like a 20 year old company but man they have scale their culture and you feel it in every single gigantic office building that Amazon inhabits Den downtown Seattle and it you know working there for the short stint that I did I was so fascinated like to do aside from nationalism United States nationalism I have never encountered a culture that was so big and so distinctive I've heard the same thing about Microsoft for the same thing about Facebook
 and I just wonder like what is it about these companies in these were start up to the certain point where they were able to scale the culture and you know certainly an Amazon there were like people from all kinds of backgrounds and you see the said every every big tech company of course if people from all kinds of background because being over over all your optimizing for people who are really smart who can get things done and you're going to find those in all kinds of backgrounds but I do wonder sometimes like what is it like you guys have any insights on what is it that gets these companies to have a distinctive culture that scales other cultures will be one of the most important pieces of a company because when everything is going well in your company culture can be kind of overlooked cuz you're a profitable you get a lot of users but when things are not going well and they're going downhill culture is probably one of the only things that will keep your team together and keep you focused
 executing and turning it around so I think with a lot of these companies anything the one of the founders of Airbnb said that after y combinator took them a couple months together first engineering higher and it's important because the two people that you do hire they're going to be hiring the next person in line and you want to instill the values of your company and make sure that people who are joining your team's they are you leaving the mission they believe in like the type of types of things that you want to promote it to be diversity could be a being Scrappy from the beginning it could be inclusive of all kinds of backgrounds but as I you start building as you start building your scaling your own team those are the types of things that are going to be valued and then they're going to be looking for those things in the next person they're bringing on board so I think it's very important to make sure you get the culture right Dad know if fully agree with everything that team was said I think that there is a difference between a culture in the community I mean
 called in the community and I think that you know when at least when I think about it called I think about it as like people falling one leader in the mission that they've put through but when I think about community and I'll leave when we think about leadership it's not necessarily like hey you guys need to follow me because I have the skill another best engineer in the group and you got me to follow me it's more like I just hired you know this person and I'm going to teach everything that I know to that person until I'm useless in the last loan you or I need to tell her Nana needs to learn a new skill and that I am power that person to be deleted themselves and then they is spouse that to the other people then I learned something that the other person was doing before I mean until that person is blows out of their role and then everyone within the community is a leader and that still spreading the message so the messages still spread throughout the organization but when we think about our community it's not necessarily like hey everybody follow our team won. It's more like know you guys are all amazing leaders yourselves why don't you guys
 go forth and spread the message and build your own people that have this flat feet using your own twist in your own tweets and you know we all growing and spread this message together it's not just following us you guys are we learning from you just like you got the money wise

 what's the connection between boot camps in startups I should have a conversation with a co-worker a couple days ago and I was telling him that I came from boot camp and that I'm starting this podcast a kind of focus on people gain from that church the background some quick why the skills and she was pretty fascinated with my store and he was like yeah that's awesome that I didn't even know that company Hyde boot congrats right but one thing that I've learned over the last few months is that actually has a number of different congrats who are not working data science project management design engineering we've probably over 10 people not from all sorts of different boot camps and everyone is kind of like but I think they're wanting to holler said that the reason people are not aware it's cuz everyone does their job well and everyone is qualified and everyone is working as a team member so to the people either on the team or adjacent
 the capital of which I'm glad from someone who came from a different background maybe had it she has a goose I think that's something before the holidays that we're not advocating for rats to be handed a job or for some reason to get the get a job to go through a separate interview process we want we can grab me one people to get an equal opportunity and then it's up to them to prove that they can actually perform the job and it was so far with my company has been working out really well we have amazing product managers amazing designers who came from non-traditional background send the Knicks are teams much richer and more successful yeah man and related to that to you know because our education system can't keep up with the pace of technology in boot camps exist right now you know it's not a silly boot camps are the only Alternative forms of Education this online course is there's no books that people have followed to get into the thing at the end of days about what you can do
 I'm in while the other Model status is now there will be other models in the future and it's more like instead of focusing on this rigid profile and no knock against cause we definitely think if you're falling up college right you should do that and there's a lot of times people that go to college but you know if you have a strong get her portfolio vs. someone that has a four-year degree both people should get the shot and I think it also comes down to just people ever thrown the ward still got a skill Gap a lot and in today's market would we consider you as well as they have the pulse on the types of rolls and the types of jobs that startups are looking for it so a lot of them will say hey like I know these companies need Engineers or I think I work these companies need to grow with marketers or designers and then they come up with the program that teaches someone in the matter of 3 to 4 months that's still sad and for your listeners I don't know how many of them are familiar with a boot camp but a lot of
 which I missed you in class from 9:09 a.m. to 6 p.m. hack reactor has class 6 days a week app Academy which is the school that I did we have class 5 days a week and then total yours probably spending close to a hundred hours a week just focusing on an acquiring that single skillset so if you add up the number of weeks over let's say 3 or 4 months the total number of hours is it was over a thousand so in the matter what thousand hours you can teach someone a scale if they're focused on a focus on practicing at building projects and then what happened to maybe some sort of Steel value a traditional computer science degree but if they're not getting enough candidates were applying with computer science degrees and they all stepped and it's not who do the boot camp Uno react to know JavaScript you can build these apps from day one then they're going to give him the shot cuz that they have deadlines to head they need these products built and if someone can come in and help them
 move the mission of long hire them so that that's what it comes down to it and also related to things about you know bookings having the pulse on on what's in the men the reason why that's very important is because the automation of jobs is a very real thing job is a very big theme in our new political agenda since you brought up the hill and lot of people talking about bringing these certain types of jobs back to America but if you look at you know the animation of skills that's a very real thing in a lot of people that are going through traditional education systems sometimes are being prepared for rolls that won't exist in the future and if you look at these boot camps they are doing everything they can to identify this girl that are going to be demanding the future and it's very important to do that because if you are a margin last person you will get left behind by this techwave that's coming cuz of professionals are going to be the ones that are going to be left behind and we keep this is can actually be an opportunity if you start
 focusing on developing the skills and you know it does it's not going to take you for years you could actually do it in 3 months and then you know go for it yeah the optimistic way of looking at it is that these boot camps condense a coating education into a very short period of time the pessimistic way of looking at it I would say is that these 12 year 16 year education Cycles off and prepare people for no jobs that are that are out there which is kind of Staggering and a lot of student loans in a lot a lot of student loans deficiency but I mean what you see the amount of inefficiency for what it is I can make you feel like you can't discuss this isn't theirs not sound like inherent problem here I mean there's a lot of problems in terms of like the the the way that case from system is structured right now but it's not like Humanity as a whole is
 capable of figuring this out and you just look at the efficiency of boot camps in that I was I did a series of shows about boot camps early on in software engineering daily and I was just so fascinated how efficient they are relative to traditional education system but your harp on that were 10-15 minutes left the Trish so at this point each of you have gotten some Traction in the world of startups and my estimation by talking to you guys and reading what you've written you are very engulfed in the startup literature you've read books you've read blog posts you've listened to podcast you understand the common words people use to discuss stars and talk about them but now that you've worked at them for a while what are some of the things that you feel the literature gets wrong I wouldn't
 did literature gets wrong but I would say something else that we talked about in the manifesto is given Manifesto Manifesto we were listed in the quiet way it's only thing it will be listing it in a much more public way but we talked about and it is sometimes rejection is your destiny Helper because I'm Asian of jobs are real thing and because most startups don't become the Facebook some Google's of the world a lot of them are going to fail and you got to get very comfortable with the fact that a lot of people get laid off and they don't talk about it I'ma that something that you you need to get comfortable with and not see it as the worst thing in the world because something you could do everything that you can't you know you could do the best that you can you could have no done your research Etc and still getting situation where you lay off that doesn't mean that your failure know you got to trust your struggle and keep moving forward because things don't work out it wasn't meant to be
 it wasn't the right time when you look back it'll make sense I think that for me that's probably one of the biggest things that jumped out to me is getting comfortable with that and it's been demonstrated throughout our experience. You know it it goes in a positive direction in and you have Clarity When You Look Backwards so I think just to add to that I think I pretty much pretty much anything anyone can call their project a startup and I think for our listeners and that you and your listeners they can probably relate to the fact that there's different types of startups out there and I think from the from the outside looking in every everyone might think that are like this person is working for a startup it must be she must be doing great but there's different categories there startups that have been fun. They're sort of Zara bootstrapping their startups that have like a strong leadership build companies before and then there is the companies that are like pursuing an idea and they're very
 so organized and there's no structure to their hiring process cheese or how their building and executing division so I think from from the outside looking in you'll have to make sure that your qualifying the company as you're interviewing with or if you're not just accepting a job from a start-up cuz they gave you an offer and you like from that point on everything's going to be great you need to do diligence and actually understand what is this company doing how do they go about building this product or executing on the mission and making sure that the company is going to be a good fit for you and you're not just doing it because you're like obsessed with a start-up notion cuz startups are hard there's what you have to put a lot of work and to Ruben's point a lot of them to fail so you need to know exactly why you're joining the team is it cuz of the morning or is it because of you want to learn from your co-workers or do you want to just work in a specific problem and become really good at virtual reality or AI or whatever that is too hot to Ruben T Morris point
 one of the mission one of those like main goal is behind are podcasts to ask her guests have been through it about what how did they go about evaluating these companies how did they go about learning this new skill and we want to kind of curious Calloway and a community that how to show other and share that knowledge cuz when three of us went through this process and we had a lot of lessons learned about it unless we start this podcast people wouldn't find out about that people that have to learn a lot of that stuff for themselves and that's the goal behind their brain starts for me is that we don't need you to Sara Lee create all the constant ourselves we going to have our members we can Empower them to share a lot of their experiences their stories their struggles and then make it more accessible to other people because even though we've had struggles on the way not everyone has the same struggle so not everyone will be able to identify with what three of us have gone through but if we encourage our members
 to share their own struggles and that's going to be able to other people for outside of tack to resonate with those struggles and also believe that they could do it as well and that's super important that until we saw examples of people like us do well in startups we had imposter syndrome we were dying ourselves then wants me so people like ourselves doing these boot camps breaking in getting jobs all the time last year when I walk and there's a lot of things that people don't talk about that just negotiating an offer understanding how Equity works right understanding how I know how the interview and it is way how to tell your story like a lot of those types of things people and I might write briefly in a blog post but it hasn't really been broken down at least to my knowledge knowledge and so far this point we just want to cry so I saw that and make it relatable you're so that's where winding down since you all have
 perspective into the finance world you spell have time to find you probably examined the past and saw that you know our economy has had Cycles bubbles crashes I wish you look at 1999 and people thought startups were over like no longer fashionable and the bubble has popped and then you look back 2 years from where we are today or 1 year even depending on who you're good thing about your hoo-hoo your to dialogues you're following and you see people saying like Okay we're here with the bubble the next bubble is here like it's going to pop again and they're still no bubble and I look at it from a technological stamp boy from a fundamental standpoint I'm like we could still got all these trends that have so much gas left in the tank like cloud computing mobile not to mention stuff like the RAR self-driving cars when I always seems are going to have so much value
 curious what you guys all have looked at France are you trying to get the feeling that this is like the cyclical nature maybe doesn't doesn't apply to 22 Tech anymore like or be no babies at this does the Cycles are we out but I don't know what just a longer cycle or I don't know what to what degree to what degree do you feel the tech a cyclical and I mean do you feel like that we're Square susceptible to some kind of bubble or what would be the cause or maybe maybe it's an existential thing that's outside the realm of tech maybe something related to a larger scope of a financing or something to to your point there is a lot of gas in the tank you know me a drawer from pottercon one of our guess he does have a great poster talks about that called when exponential probably should come to reality and talks about the second half of the chessboard and a lot of these things that are going to become
 I'm up if you want to read about that from my perspective in two more out there a little after 8 and I'll check it still sick will go and I think that's evidence by people investors done to focus Less on you know just draw so much more and profitability and companies that can demonstrate traction earlier versus just giving them a bunch of money and making everybody just getting quick round I'm in so this day that's already starting to be evidence and I think that even when there is a cycle that's going on a downward trend from a you know throwing money around Christmas if you could see some of the greatest companies that were created during the the the downward cycle like the Ubers in the air airbnb's of the world so I'm that's my perspective on it yeah and I think you'll start to look at look at it from two perspectives the long-term and short-term so in the short-term there could be like a funding bubble maybe there's
 there's a lot of money that's venture capitalist have raised and they've been just knowing I think over the last couple of years this money at all these different ideas and maybe there is some sort of bauble the way that investors shifting towards companies that might have better numbers they're working on more serious ideas but if you look on the on the loan in the long-term the 4 out of the 5 for the top Fortune 500 companies it's Apple it's Amazon it's alphabet which is Google and those companies are old using tag and some form to get a competitive advantage over the traditional companies that were in their place before and so Amazon is now using machine learning their building drones to to create a competitive advantage over Walmart's of the world over Barnes and Nobles and all those companies that seal to innovate so I think in the future you'll see more companies more startup
 that probably don't even exist today they will Zero in on a certain problem they'll be able to come up with a better solution and those companies are going to be like it it's almost undeniably that there's going to be driverless cars maybe not in the next 5 years but in 20-30 years there are going to be driverless cars and there's going to be millions of people out of jobs like the truck drivers who are not going to have those jobs show as a country we have to ask ourselves what it what kind of rolls like we do we want to create for those people are we addressing how's our education system addressing all these people according to be left behind unless they acquire the skill sets so in 10-15 years looking back at this. It'll be pretty evident that those transition those signs were on the wall and people who enter the industry early on will be some of the frontrunners and leading these corporations and Creative Solutions to these problems I guess my
 kriti insular thinking in terms of just a bubble in air the cyclical nature of just Silicon Valley but if you think about like the the larger economy like most most people never recovered from the 2008 housing crisis they're still in a recession the numbers may not capture it certainly not the stock prices of Facebook Amazon Google and so on and then there's a lot of companies that you know people call that work they were calling unicorns that I actually like right I forgot what the term is that if something like Yoona corpses or something like that okay and try to like the shorts are Bubble right because you brought up a few times so I think it's actually two of each sink forces so on one hand the Starbucks need funding from investors right because if your lunch and Company then you need someone to pay for the servers to give it to provide some additional Capital but on the other hand this to the closest starting companies also
 I'm down significantly and you could start a company with much less resources and you could just put strap as well so they notice kind of sudametrica opposed forces that on one hand The Venture Capital will still has an effect on the start of the ecosystem but on the other hand since the closet and they are very chantry's much lower now that you can still have start-up ideas that prove themselves to be successful and have traction and just companies could do so well that they may not have any Venture table right we haven't sent you an example some of that yet but it's coming cuz sorry if you have a hundred thousand saved up you no longer need to raise a seed round you can just push of yourself until a milestone in that if your if you have pain customers and you may not even need to raise it also I noticed two forces of play in the last of the more we are self-reliant the Lazarus effect that had some bubble or some sort of the economic crisis will affect the Tsar B go system but I think it's still kind of working so well
 a few years to play at a crew then and then and then Lightning by the job site is is opening it up so that you're not fully dependent on Venture Capital you have syndicates that you can raise money from and things like that through Angel listing friends like that so you know a lot of skills and a lot of axis Capital starting to be democratize for the people and so if we organize and we mobilizing we work together as a community you know we can do a lot of powerful things end up the vegetable Community again it's very important but you may not always have to be fully dependent on it ribbon Archer Tamara thanks for coming on the show I appreciate you guys and I really enjoy the break into Stars podcast I wish you guys the best of success and I think everybody who was in software engineering daily should check out breaking into startups thank you for that thanks Jeff thanks

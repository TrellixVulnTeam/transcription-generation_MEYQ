Transcription: botnets have a massive influence on the internet as we have seen recently with the Mirai botnet iot Bots can take down companies as big as Netflix or Twitter in our recent episodes about advertising fraud we've talked about how Bots are being used to take billions of dollars of revenue from advertisers Derek Muller is one of those advertisers who has spent money on ads and got nothing but fake traffic in return 2 years ago he posted a video on YouTube about his experience purchasing this advertising traffic on Facebook and how he just got likes from accounts that were clearly from fake accounts Derek is the hosts veritasium which is an awesome YouTube channel about science and truth and technology so he's got some awesome YouTube videos and he's turned that into a successful business who is very interesting to hear about his YouTube business but more to the point of this episode it was interesting to hear about
how we basically paid for fake traffic he paid for likes that end up being fake and this is a microcosmic example of the problems of advertising fraud and why I'm doing all these these episodes about it because if you work in Tech there's a good chance that you work on adtech so if you do you should be trying to understand if your company is designed in a way to effectively prevent fraud cuz my sense from doing the shows is that as an industry we can do better at preventing advertising fraud so talk to people within your company about it if you work in the Attic industry and whether or not you working at tech industry I hope you like this episode with Derek he's a very entertaining guests

Derek Muller is the creative director of veritasium a company that makes scientific in educational content online Derek welcome to software engineering Daily Post a lot of videos
YouTube and a few years ago you posted this YouTube video that showed evidence that Facebook's Revenue benefited from fake likes and before we get into the details of how this works explain why you made this video for such a long time ago but I guess the reason I made it was because I had this personal experience with Facebook where you know a friend of mine actually took over the Facebook advertising because I wasn't really in a focus on what I was doing on Facebook I was in a primarily a YouTube Creator and I saw my Facebook numbers just taking off and he wasn't investing that much money but he was just sort of advertising my page on Facebook using Facebook Sarasota funeral promote your page type features in that amazing I've got so many fans on Facebook this is incredible but I guess the problem was they didn't engage with my posts it was as though
no I had 80,000 likes on Facebook but I was getting no more engagement than when I had two thousand likes on Facebook so something was fishy and I guess that started me down the path of trying to figure out what was going on at what is the functionality of the like feature on Facebook that's a good question I mean I think in the old days I think what everyone assumed about the like button was you know if you were friends with someone you would see all their posts in your feed and if you like the page you would see that Page's posts in your feet I think that was the basic idea in the early days of Facebook that'll like mint show me what this guy is putting out an overtime it has become kind of an engine of Facebook learning what to serve you and it uses that to help serve you more targeted ads and things like that and as a content creator
you would benefit from having your content get into the hands of more people who have liked things that are similar to the content that you're creating so as a content creator it it doesn't make sense from Premier Stan Stan .22 seek out likes I think it made a lot of sense especially back in the day when you know Facebook would basically show anything you post to a significant fraction of people who say they like your page I think that that obviously it was great to have that as a distribution Outlet so you know people would get notified whenever you make something you know they like what you do they want to see it and this is a way for you to you know let them know show in this video that you made you were rehashing Italy started out at least you were rehashing the results that were found by this reporter there was a reporter who wrote a news article about Center member with that news article was but they're Porter had set up a page called virtual Bagel which is you know I was
absurd the thing who would who would pay attention to something like that and he he was just creating that cuz he hit his goal of the article was trying to try to derive the financial value of a like on Facebook like if you can get if you can some people liked on Facebook what kind of monetary value does that have until in his research he paid $100 to Facebook to promote his page to promote virtual Bagel what happened when he paid for that promotion I'm trying to remember now and I hate to say it but it's such a long time ago yeah I was that he got a lot of likes from countries where you know he wouldn't necessarily be interested in having followers ever call you know places like Egypt I guess being where he was getting a lot of his legs but he wound up with the quality of likes that he would get from a click Farm in there are
places where you can pay you know you can pay what their websites where you can just pay it they're totally unrelated to Facebook where you can pay people in Egypt to click on the like button and like your content but if you are purchasing ads through Facebook you wouldn't expect to have the same quality of distribution but that is in fact what happened to this virtual Bagel reporter right absolutely yeah I think definitely promoting through Facebook stool you expect that you are you know reaching people that matter to you I think that's the line that Facebook actually uses and you have a Facebook page yourself veritasium and you have tried Facebook ads because Facebook gave you some free credit to buy those ads so when you bought those ads in the Facebook was giving you was oh you'd be able to Target people who are interested in
what you are what you are for the content you're producing so what did you expect to get out of those ads when you were going to buy them when I promoted the page on Facebook I expected that you know a lot of people who liked my videos on YouTube would just like my page on Facebook and in fact because I wasn't really sure how the Facebook system worked I asked a friend of mine to handle it for me because he had a big Facebook page about science so I just basically handed it off and I didn't really look closely at how he went about using that credit that Facebook gave but I think he just promoted the page in it the most simple way possible and just said you know yeah sure this page two more people and see who likes it and then the lights came rolling in was increasing thousands by the day and I thought it was amazing and maybe also too good to be true right which it ended up being 75% of your life
were from countries like Sri Lanka Egypt Bangladesh the Philippines these were the countries where accounts were liking your page from using Facebook advertising so I mean what is problematic about that how do you know that those aren't just you know legitimate accounts the biggest sign that those were not legitimate accounts were that my engagement with the post that I made did not go up as a result of having you know going from 2000 likes on my page to 80 thousand likes if anything the number of people liking and commenting on posts went down and that's kind of a crazy results you know the scientist you look at various systems and you think what would I expect expect the engagement to go out 40 times if those are genuine people who like my content and of course they
engaging at the same rates as as other people so it would go down proportionally or did it go down look absolutely I'm not sure to be precise I think that the engagement stayed roughly the same and possibly went down on some posts but you know Facebook was also making other shifts at that time for example reducing distribution any post got from any page so yeah it was a combination of things but definitely I did not see an increase in likes and comments on posts if anything there was a slight decrease right show so these fake likes have a either neutral or negative effect on your ability to actually reach your legitimate audience it possible that paying for it paying for the advertising that leads these fake likes could actually just have the neg have the reverse effect that you would like absolutely I think it's even
I think as the algorithm has adjusted over the years it's become more and more true that having fake likes on the page is detrimental to the page because you know my understanding of them is they show your post initially to just a very small fraction of your audience to just sort of test the waters and see if anyone likes this post and that kind of makes sense from Facebook point of view they don't want to show a post to a whole bunch of people that maybe is just a really bad post so they show it to maybe 1% of the audience or maybe even less than that to see is this something that people are going to like in engage with and if they do that's when Facebook will show it to a bigger fraction of the audience so having those fake likes they're essentially means that some of that 1% of your audience may not even be you know a genuine account and so they will not be engaging with it with your post which makes all of your posts look less effective and look less interesting than they are and you suggested one potential solution where you could
you could have done advertising campaign where you would exclude these countries where fake likes frequently come from you could exclude Bangladesh and Egypt and Sri Lanka is there something wrong with that strategies or something about that strategy that wouldn't work for me. I did run an experiment so you know in the model of virtual bagel I created virtual cat as I know the internet loves cats and so what I wanted to do with the that experiment was basically replicate the same results of virtual bagel and show that if you if you just promote a page it doesn't matter what it is you could call the followers that page stupid which I did on Virtual cat you know you could make the most ridiculous page but you could print pay to promote it on Facebook and you would end up with click Farm likes you know likes from the types of countries like Egypt in the Philippines I'll ask yourself if you weren't careful about targeting that was my plan so when I started that experiment for whatever reason
I just thought will let me prove first that this page is so stupid and so idiotic that no one outside of a click Farm country would like it so first I targeted ads only at places like the United States and Canada Australia and UK places where I did have a legitimate following with veritasium places where I suspected there going to be no click Farms so I just wanted to demonstrate to myself and you know for this experiment you can't get likes on this page from rational people that was step one and then Step 2 I was going to open it up to places like Egypt in the Philippines in Sri Lankan and just show that the lights come pouring in but that's where I got surprised because in Phase 1 of my experiment using only countries that I would not expect to see click farms in I still got a lot of likes within the first day you know spending just 10:20 bucks I had 20 40
liking the page immediately 60 people it just kept growing so even in countries where I thought there's no way these are click Farms I was still getting likes that seems odd I think you paid $10 to get exposure to this virtual cat page and you got a bunch of likes that looks like they were from places they were writing they're not from Sri Lanka or Egypt or whatever where were these lights coming from they were coming from the US and Canada UK you know they were coming from from places where I didn't think there should be fake accounts but when I started looking at the individual account said it like the page I found these people were liking thousands and thousands of pages which if I look at my own friends circle did not seem normal right most of my friends don't like thousands of pages on Facebook but almost everyone who like my virtual cat page did
like you know 900 800 a thousand two thousand pages and so that sort of behavior I deemed very unusual

 Facebook has deleted fake accounts in the past and you mentioned One Sweep that have in the past where Facebook deleted 83 million accounts but they didn't delete the likes that came from those accounts why is that problematic I'm not even sure they deleted those are those accounts at all I mean I'm sure they deleted 83 million accounts but my my suggestion from my experience is that there may be many more Millions out there that they didn't delete so I know for example on the veritasium page when they did their sweep and deleted accounts I was still you know I still have most of those 80,000 accounts that I think were kind of Click fraud or or certainly not genuine accounts I still have them on the road
 same page and I still feel like they're a bit of deadweight that I lug around with me even though I know the page has something like 350,000 likes you know I still feel kind of saddled with a whole bunch of fake likes and so for a while my strategy had to be for every post I would make I would have to Target around those countries to try to exclude those you know false accounts from being shown this post and then artificially dragging down the kind of Engagement scores that these posts would get did you get any response from Facebook when you posted these videos really not not directly to me however it became a bit of a story that some reporters followed up on and reporters got a response from Facebook which I thought is you know Facebook basically played to confirmation bias so their response to my concerns that they were fake accounts and
 Mike likes happening was there are businesses that have been successful in promoting products on Facebook therefore there are no fake likes its kind of it it's a funny logic which would appeal to someone if they were kind of looking to say that Facebook was great you know like I can I can of course there are companies out there that have made money on Facebook and then it that use it very successfully and I still use Facebook I think it's available platform that doesn't mean that there aren't problems that doesn't mean that there aren't fake likes and that you know some of the adverb in you may be wasted you can look at big government attempt to engage lots of fans on Facebook and eventually getting you know basically no engagement but 600000 likes and that sort of thing or you know spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in yet ending with no nothing to show for it show
 why is this important I mean why because I mean I have my own reasons for believing why this is important and I'm doing a series of shows about add fraud because my ass my assertions basically that the ad the ad tech industry is really really big and the internet cut the current structure the internet is really dependent on advertising and yet we are in this perverse position where we can't really ought it the the ad tech industry so why why is this important you know I think making sure the advertising is what it purports to be is very important because a lot of people are spending a lot of money to get their content you know to the audiences that they they want them to get too so you know I know Google went through this in the early days if you know having pay-per-click tape advertising they have a hold of vision around click fraud
 similarly I think you know Facebook needs to have that as well if these companies can't show that they're sure that the clicks are genuine that they're sure that the audiences that you're reaching are genuine then I think that leads to a big sort of crisis of confidence for the whole industry and people are going to be much less willing to to pay this from up there their stock if it's not reaching real ID in it so I think the burden of proof is kind of on the on these should have advertising networks including Facebook and Google to demonstrate that everything is what it seems for some online ad networks they open themselves up to third-party scrutiny so you know Google can't claim to send a certain number of the certain amount of traffic to your web page but that not match up with say a third-party account of how much traffic your website is getting right so there should be third-party audits of all
 list to make sure that everything is legitimate when I was investigating this Facebook was one of the few companies that was refusing to allow third-party audit so everything about the Facebook picture of model struck me as a little bit dodgy and I I I hope that they've cleaned up their act in the last few years but it just seems like everything is a little bit of a gray area there and and I was a little skeptical of what was going on yeah I agree with all that it's a lot of Grey area what worries me is it like and I talked to some people who are like it look if if there was that much fraud in the industry you know it don't be factored into the price and that would be factored into the price of advertising advertisers would sense that overtime you know efficient market hypothesis blah blah blah and you know I just think about the 2008 financial crisis where
 we had herds of Bankers that believed these mortgage-backed Securities were on correlated of these are definitely worth the amount of money that were trading them at and I turned out that the heard was wrong and it turned out that there was not an Efficient Market in the mortgage-backed security industry which was a giant industry and that's you know I'm really beginning to suspect that that's what's going on with this advertising stuff because I do not see auditability and it regardless of if you have it even if you have a third-party monitor there's nothing as a third-party can do there's nothing that Google can do this is too hard of a problem to reliably say how much frothers partially because like if a frog is making it past your system how can you audit your own system how can you even say with confidence what percentage of your traffic is fraudulent if by its very nature that fraud has no
 being caught absolutely I think it's a problem when I first posted my videos about the Facebook like fraud most people were very supportive and I think they looked at the experiment that I ran and they saw that you know I was just trying to get to the bottom of it I was trying to figure out what was going on and I think there were a lot of pieces of evidence for example if the engagement I got from most countries on my other testing Facebook page was you know in the 30 to 50% on every post so or on a post over a month so genuine accounts were engaging with what I did on it on a level of you know every other post kind of thing on average but for the countries like the Philippines Egypt Bangladesh Sri Lanka where I had big followings as a result of that promoting the page campaign I was getting engagements of around 1% less than 5% Shirley and all of those countries and that to me was such a key indicator that I had all these accounts that weren't behaving
 like normal accounts and those are the ones that I gained through promoting the page so most people I think I understood that I was out there to run an experiment figure out what was going on but I did get significant push back from social media marketers basically people who you know their job is to promote other peoples pages on Facebook and they were trying to reassure their clients no know what he's talking about is rubbish or if you know you just need me because I know what I'm doing he didn't know what he was doing to me is reminiscent of what you said about you know the housing crisis if you have a whole bunch of people who are invested in believing that something works or something is worth the value that people think it is they make kind of ignore evidence to the contrary and they may just look for evidence that confirms what they believe
 there was a prominent Serta Facebook marketer who took issue with the experiments that I ran and he said I just wish he had taken this further in and push the experiment some more and put more money into it and then investigated more accounts and and I was thinking you know you're a Facebook expert I invested I don't know 50 bucks or something like that if you want you can go out there and do the same experiment it's not it's not hard to replicate and this is the process of science no one has to believe me because you know I'm telling you what I did if you doubt what I did you know go try it for yourself that was exactly what I was saying to the industry and I was I was shocked at the response I got was kind of incredulity covered over with oh I wish he had tried this it's like you don't have to have me to do it like you can do it yourself it's it's really really easy to to run experiments on the system and try to test your hypotheses because really that's what this comes down to
 you know how genuine are those likes in and how worthwhile are those engagements similarity I think about to the 2008 Chrysler just like there's like this what you know there's this huge industry where nobody really has an interest in in policing what's going on and nobody has an interest in stopping the music except for the second single party that is kind of getting bilked witches and I guess in the I guess it kind of in the mortgage-backed security was I guess the the borrowers who had these adjustable rate mortgages and then in the in the ad Tech world it's these Procter & Gamble or Ford of these companies that you're buying tons of digital advertising online that is not easy to measure it's like stuff that is not easy to you know maybe the conversion based stuff is a little easier to measure but like this more brand advertise
 is a lot harder to measure so so yeah I don't know it end I'm talking to an ad fraud specialist on the show in an upcoming episode in his his mission has kind of become to talk to the branch talk to these big brands in like say to that Mike hey you guys should really be holding Facebook and Google speak to the fire and of course all these other AD tech companies that perhaps have less of a sterling reputation you should really hold their feet to the fire if you want to see where your advertising dollars are going but I don't know but it's interesting cuz like even those even those companies like they have a CMO you know that the Ford has some CMO and it's like if they can't spend their money on digital where they going to spend their money that's where all the eyeballs are
 but I know it's interesting I like you know I mean in project with your different videos and won't get into this more as you are a truth-seeker so when you have a situation like this where it's really hard to prove exactly what is going on and that's how I feel when I'm digging into this is like I feel like I can't prove very much about it any what is the approach that you're supposed to take I think is definitely the experimental approach so you try to you know test a hypothesis and hold variables as constant as you can and and very certain things and look at the results objectively that's what I tried to do with that with this and that video that we're discussing that were referring to is almost 3 years old which you know maybe maybe Facebook has cleaned up a lot since then but I think at this point they're like an 11 year old company 10 or 11 year old companies you would think even 3 years ago that would have
 a little more of a but good filtration system for for-profit have you kept up with Facebook since it if you kept up with like how many perspective on how they're they're advertising pipeline has changed not really I mean I keep using Facebook personally or or for veritasium and I found it much more effective once I realized that I had all these countries with not not genuine likes I found that excluding them from my posts increase the reach an engagement in my post about tenfold so it was after I did that video and I that's what I really took a hard luck I mean before that I was like I have some fake likes on my page I don't really know what to do or how to figure this out but once I made that video when I took a hard look at all the likes on my page and I said 80,000
 I don't think anyone in these countries are or many people in these countries actually watch my videos on YouTube I think that these accounts are totally bogus it was only after that I started getting much better engagement from from Facebook by targeting every post around those countries and I just wish that you know Facebook gave me a tool so I could actually remove the Lakers from my page in some sort of bulk way because it was as though advertising through Facebook actually made the page less effective you know that was clearly the evidence that I had you know Facebook is continuing down a tough path because now if I post something that's successful I'll get these little notifications from Facebook that say Hey this post is performing better than 95% of post on this page right into me if you're a social media Network and you want
 you know the people who come to you to your app and whatever to enjoy their experience you want to show them popular posts that's you know the name of the game right people go on social media to see the popular stuff in yet here's Facebook and because they need to find a way to make money out of it they're basically saying to content creators we know that this content is really good we know that your followers like it but we're not going to just show it to them because we need to make money somehow so how about you pay us and then we'll show it to them so I think that this this sort of business model always to me seems a little bit backwards compared to YouTube for example where you know YouTube wants people to see your content if it's liked if it's successful if it's attracting a lot of Engagement and they don't want people to see it if it's not great so you know YouTube has the incentive to show more stuff to more people when it's good
 and not to show it so much when it's not getting great engagement Facebook kind of has the opposite incentive or they definitely want you to pay more when it is good cuz I know you want to get it out to more people so it's it's an awkward business model where I feel like the objectives of all the parties are not aligned YouTube the objectives are aligned because YouTube pays the Creator for views on their content Facebook and contrast is Facebook requires the creators to pay for distribution so on YouTube YouTube takes care of the distribution some white or the core says Hey Creator you have to take care of the distribution but you'll be rewarded for the fuse on your content Facebook says we'll take care of distribution if you just passed more and then you have to figure out other ways to monetize that content exactly exactly so you know it's just the way I guess the business models work
 you know for all of Facebook's flies I still find it a very useful a platform so it's it's funny because I can recognize its flaws but also see that see the value in it and see the ways that I can use it that that work well as always been a little bit unethical because for example when they went into video they didn't build in a Content ID system which YouTube now has so they basically went into video and you know 80% of their big view hits were ripped almost directly off YouTube and and other sites so a lot of the successive video on on Facebook was through copyright infringement which I don't think they really resolved yet and furthermore their way of counting views is if someone spends
 3 seconds muted with a video playing that counts is of you so again crazy inflated view numbers really obnoxious copyright infringement they should have known better with all of these things in and maybe they should have known better with quick fried but to me it feels like they're willing to play a little bit fast and loose to try to pump up there at their sales and I know there's this huge expectations on Facebook as a publicly listed company I get that they have to show progress but you know I think that sometimes LED them to the kind of bend the rules a little bit have you studied the water online advertising ecosystem at all I have not know I mean my interest in in Facebook ad for I really came down to the fact that I thought something weird was going on and I thought people should know and that's why I made my videos about Facebook I don't really have a general interest in online advertising because it's not part of my world

 why do you want to talk a little bit more about your world because it is about science and this show is is rooted in science is mostly focused on the software engineering aspects of science but getting things right in software engineering is often about understanding how to conduct experiments how to be scientific and show from that point if you talk about veritasium what are your motivations with the veritasium project I got started in veritasium because of my kind of three passions one in filmmaking to an education and at 3 in science so this was like the perfect job for me I love what I do which is just making videos about any topic that has any sort of scientific aspect to it that interest me so yeah I guess my goal is to kind of be a teacher but also be a filmmaker and so as an example that you had a video release
 they were you discussing the idea that most published research is wrong it is not reproducible you talked about this project with the goal of reproducing scientific papers known as the reproducibility project and you talk about how few of these papers really can be reproduced why is that did we make a wrong turn in science somewhere that let us to having a bunch of buggy studies that can be reproduced that getting to objective truths is hard and that's why the scientific Enterprise does he have you know it's it goes down some dead-end sometimes and then sometimes things are published which turned out to be false I think more recently there's a challenge of incentives again when it comes to the scientist and it comes to journals and research institutions all of them have incentives which
 fine with publishing a lot and not necessarily disincentives for publishing false things so you know when you set up a system like that I guess you shouldn't be surprised if the result has a lot of blood incorrect publish papers in it and answered of a lower quality of research there's a lot of people try to make a career in science now and there's really only one way to have a successful career and that's to publish and getting things wrong doesn't matter as much as you think it maybe should write and you gave an example of how this can work in practice with the study of weight loss where there was a study that was constructed with a very small sample size I can resist example where the finding was that at eating chocolate led to faster weight loss in in combination with a low-carb diet then just a low-carb diet
 it's off or then the no intervention than just a control group so yeah I mean if you set up an experiment in that kind of basically demonstrate how easy it is to get a false positive and then how easy it is to get the news media around the world to embrace it because it's such a great narrative kind of his problems in science right small sample sizes and you know fun stories that serve detract from the fact that the science wasn't run as well as it should have been show this study was really designed to yield desirable results regardless of the outcome show it was an academic example but I feel like this is actually everywhere in our society like we see experiments designed to succeed in Michigan economics Madison dramatically in medicine I'm sure we see it in online advertising in certain ways
 but yeah I mean it isn't like this always have Sciences been conduct I feel like there was a point in time where like you have a hypothesis up front you try to test a hypothesis and if your proven wrong you say okay I was proven wrong it's not like this okay I'm going to experiment and I'm going to structure the experiment to have a successful result after I see the results of the experiment you know I think science I mean we can we can say that it was different in the past but I think there's always it's always been a human endeavor and as such it's always been subject to human foibles you can look back to the early days is the the Millikan oil drop experiment I think is a famous example where you know who trying to figure out properties of the electron and the scientist performing the work got some good results he also got some results that didn't really help his case or that he thought you know just kind of Nitto muddied the waters and so he hit those results check them in a drawer and just published the one
 set that supported what he thought was really happening so you know it's always been that kind of thing it turns out he was right but it turns out we've always been doing things that are a little bit nefarious and that just because you know there's there's human incentives behind all this and then you got to publish or perish you got to make a name for yourself somehow and you know science has a very good record of at least you know correcting those mistakes when they happen at least we're trying to get to the truth the system could be better designed to do to help us you know get there more often and I think some of the changes were seeing coming down and Piper are good ones like for example writing to journal's first before you do a study describing exactly the study that you're going to run and exactly the analysis you're going to execute and you know then regardless of the results that journal will agree to publish or not your paper based on what you're doing
 rather than on the results you got I definitely have the experience as a research scientist of you know sometimes having papers rejected because of the results of the experiment when I could point to a very similar experience in that that was published in the journal but it just got a different result and in my view if you're only publishing an experiment because it got of the result of God that I feel like that's not science you going to publish beast on near what the experiment is and let the result be what it is that's one of the big problems is that nobody wants to publish no results these days so you know no one ever really wanted to publish no results because that's less interesting but it leads to horrible bias in in the research literature that gets published it certainly does so you have spent some time in Academia give me patience for how the Publications that come out of Academia differ from the type of scientific research that comes out of Industry that's a very good question I don't know much
 Publications that come out of Industry that aren't also published in academic journals you know for me the main body of literature is is the academic one that's very helpful honest honest answer show institutions publish in an academic Journal science you know what that's that's the Holy Grail right so you know our world is so Rife with statistical lies and misunderstandings about statistics and you know I like any sort of media source that promotes a healthy amount of skepticism which I think veritasium really does how does how does that how does it change your behavior to be somebody that is you know reflexively looking for Stitch
 mystical mishaps in our everyday culture is that I think life is more difficult if you are more skeptical I think that human brains don't love ambiguity but as a scientist like myself it's some sort of part of my nature that I have to deal with doubt an ambiguity all the time this bleeds into all aspects of my life like when I'm ask simple questions like do you want a cup of tea I actually consider the question in kind of a deep wave like would I like that and kind of envisioned myself it's it's horrible but I think it's the kind of approach that one needs if you are to get to the truth of matters you know our brains are very good at leaping to conclusions I'll give you a fun example there's there's some sort of kidney disease
 I believe the place where this kidney disease most most common in the u.s. is in small rural to the red State areas if you if you will so like little populated rural feel like I'm butchering the story but anyway there's some sort of Affliction in a tentative flicks you know what the highest percentage in any sort of small town rural Republican areas and could be in our like why is that and you might want to draw some association with lifestyle or what what's happening out there if you if you ask a question where the lowest incidences of the of this disorder the answer is also in low populated rural kind of Republican areas
 so the reason is there's nothing cause all about those communities what's causal is small sample sizes so when you have no small towns or or small counties or whatever then statistical fluctuations push push the numbers way up in way down but people looking at one thing or the other might be inclined to draw conclusions from that you know might might be looking for some sort of cause of connections any of this helps and where we're trying to go with this in the in this answer but I guess the point I'm trying to make is that you know taking a scientific approach is uncomfortable from a human standpoint it means withholding judgment it means not trying to confirm what you believe but actually looking to disconfirm or a to contradict what you believe that's the scientific approach relationships
 love to jump to cause a relationships do you have to take a step back and say that's one hypothesis what are the other things that could be going on here everybody loves a causal relationship everyone loves a story you know me the number of videos about about this in fact a kind of inspired by the whole Facebook event I made this video about confirmation bias which is called the can you solve this is about a little number game have you seen this video I don't think I saw that one because basically I went up to people and I said look I'm going to tell you three numbers at three number sequence and what I want you to do is trying to figure out this rule I have in mind that my numbers obey okay but I don't just want you to guess the rule I want you to do is proposed your own set of three numbers could be whatever numbers you like but I will say yes if that follows the rule that I was thinking okay and know if it doesn't follow the rules
 after that you can propose work for true you think it is so okay you ready to play yeah the three numbers in my sequence are to 4824 H okay I'm going to say 9 1836 those numbers also follow my rule okay so what is the rule pick random numbers that is not to do it again right that is a rule and the rules I agree they do obey both sets of numbers that you proposed and I proposed but that is not actually the rule that I'm thinking oh okay so you should propose another set of three numbers would would be helpful another set of three numbers okay I ate at 1632 then also
 fall asleep Royal yes okay so even numbers that can be doubled is not the rule okay Dad and I can see it you can't concede three more numbers 1 to 4 follow the rule okay again see through my numbers okay 16 32 64 also follows the rule with the powers of 2 in in order it is not powers of 2 I mean that wouldn't work for the first one I said yeah the numbers you propose to follow the rule okay I don't know how to say I have to give up this world let me ask you this question did you propose to me any set of three numbers where it wasn't
 double it and double it again no so this is a perfect example of what the human brain does it sees a pattern and then says I know what the pattern is it's this pattern and then it continually tests that pattern again and again and again but you were never going to get any information that way because I was going to say yes all of those things follow the rule but that's not the rule so what are we have to do is humans we need to propose rules that don't follow what we were thinking right to test a hypothesis you have to try to break it you have to try to break your rule so a good a good set of numbers would have been eight 1631 right that would have been a good a good set of numbers to test and you would have found it to follow the rule so maybe you would have tried eight nine ten that also follows the rule maybe then you would have tried 10 9 8 which does not follow the rules all you needed was numbers in ascending order
 so this is this is what I'm talking about I'm and I'm glad we get to the heart of the matter here right which is that this is what's hard about science and this is what's hard about interpreting our world when we see patterns we are so drawn to them that sometimes we don't notice that the pattern that we saw maybe was just noise maybe was not the pattern that was there but if we go on just kind of believing that you know we got ourselves in a lot of a problem lot lot lot of trouble we just don't get to the truth absolutely yeah I know that's true you could spend a lot of time in like a local maximum of error exactly exactly why I love this book by Nate silver called the signal in the noise and and a lot of that book kind of talks about overfitting so you know there's certain patterns in data but like maybe that maybe that's not the real pattern maybe that's not the real train maybe that's just noise and you've kind of fit the noise yeah that's a problem when it when you know I talk to these Facebook marketers ever
 I wanted to say because I've seen Facebook marketing be effective for me I know that it is effective and there couldn't possibly be fake accounts where they don't realize that both things could be true it could be true that yeah Facebook marketing works well for some people in some situations and also there are fake likes that are crossing businesses and the government hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars okay will show just to close off I want to talk a little bit about the the business of running a YouTube business cuz it seems it's similar to the podcast business and I'm just curious about the strategy and the economics of it what your experience running a YouTube business been like my experience has been that it's the favorite my favorite thing that I've ever done in my life that I feel like I get to work on my dream job virtually every day I get to choose something that I'm interested in and
 try to pursue it and try to create something that I'm proud of you can be a challenge but I'd say more more often than not it's it's very rewarding for the first two years of making YouTube channel I didn't make any money so definitely it's a thing that had a large lead time on it and if I hadn't been so passionate dedicated and really wanted this thing to work I probably would have stopped in it and you know that that was the hardest part but now it's it's just amazing to you know I feel remarkably lucky and thankful for every day that I can I can make YouTube videos full time do you have to run to do other media channels and stuff to the YouTube channel is a definitely it's a full-time job I do other bits and pieces like I do talks sometimes for teachers or other groups
 I do some TV shows like right now I've just wrapped filming with Netflix for the show Bill Nye Saves the World some correspondent on that show that's awesome thanks I found a couple documentaries 1/4 PBS called uranium twisting the dragons tail and another documentary on curiositystream called digits which is all about the internet so yeah a lot of a bit as a result of the YouTube channel but the YouTube channel is still kind of where my heart is and that's where I want to keep putting my effort so what's in the future for veritasium what kind of topics are you going to be covering the near future I am working on a video right now which is about how we can use vibrating bath of silicone oil and little droplets on the surface to simulate kind of quantum mechanics and what does that tell us about about Heather weird crazy Quantum World works that sounds awesome
 well thanks for coming the show and discussing fake likes and veritasium and all your your scientific philosophies it's it's it's been real pleasure and I continue to tune into your YouTube channel fantastic thanks so much for trying to me

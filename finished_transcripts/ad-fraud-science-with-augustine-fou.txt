Transcription: advertising fraud continues to plague the internet we do not know the scope and scale of that fraud how many ads on the internet are viewed by Bots estimation range from 2% to 99% advertisers are slowly becoming more educated about fraud thanks in part to dr. Augustine Foo doctor Foo is a full-time advertising fraud researcher he looks at data sets of billions of add Impressions to figure out how fraud works and help victims of add fraud make their case last year Doctor Who came on the show to give an overview of his perspective on the world of add fraud today we dive into the importance of Twitter in add fraud schemes we also talked about the severity of fraud on mobile apps you download a flashlight app or an alarm clock app or keyboard those apps could be displaying hidden ads that actually never show up

 Augustine Foo is an ad fraud researcher with marketing science Consulting Group Augustine welcome back to software engineering daily thanks Jeffrey glad to be on the show again last time we talked about the depths of add fraud we gave an overview to the listeners who were unfamiliar with it or maybe they had heard some of the episodes with shawland are who is also been on the show a number of times he is another one of the foremost add fraud researchers in the space that is still pretty small the area of forensic add science and Shaolin lives in San Francisco so I've hung out with him a few times since are you and I have last talked and I talked to him on it'll be a biweekly basis and every time I talk to him he's got an interesting stories to tell about how brands are waking up to the realities of advertising fraud how
 business for you are you having the same kinds of conversations with these Brands yeah it's actually finally come around and I think the topic of add fraud people kind of known about for a long time but they haven't actually been openly talking about it until this year so with some of the work that the na has done around at fraud and also transparency issue shot in the ecosystem more more marketers are actually start to talk about it ask intelligent questions about it and things like that so you know it it's actually a very good thing for the industry because we we need to understand the problem so that we can actually go take appropriate action to solve it and mitigate it and she always tells me crazy anecdotes when I talk to him so he tells me about
 some data set that he's working with his you'll have a client engagement the client will give him this data set and he'll dig through it and he'll find some interesting URL and we'll go to that you are all feel like a situs is completely you know this is not a real site basically it's infested with bot traffic things like that do you have any crazy anecdotes that you've come across since we last spoke yeah I mean bottom line is it's would you consider 100% fraud crazy I mean it's like these days you know I've seen everything so it's almost like nothing surprises me anymore but we're still seeing that kind of stuff you know all over the place because you're the bad guys are still committing the fraud it's so lucrative for them you know why stop right you can scale it virtually infinitely and there's no cost of Entry right it's not like the old days where you actually have to set up a website to buy some server hardware and then you know power website
 now everything can be pay as you go down in the cloud so there's no cost of Entry so anybody including you know from script kiddies to organized crime anybody can commit a fraud and so they are because it is so lucrative and the point is I think marketers ultimately need to be responsible for their own dollars cuz it's coming out of their pockets in and you know they're spending it none of the middleman in the supply chain you know will be forthcoming and will actually help in the process of solving fraud because even if they're not committing the fraud they're all benefiting from it because they make tons and tons of Revenue on it right and so now it's really when the marketers are waking up that's really the most important step which is they have to take control they have to ask the hard questions and then they have to take the actions needed to
 Silph Road in their own buys right it's not like the industry can solid for them for everyone each brand marketer has to do it for their own buys hard to bring into focus is the fact that you're talking about a digital ad fraud you know it doesn't matter very well to how we perceive fraud in the real world to like the the map into the real world might be your pudding millions and millions of billboards under the ocean and like you're having fish you're like measuring the number of use that fish have on those Billboards like that's that's what Dad fraud is like but even that is not really an accurate analogy because you can't you can't instantiate Oceanic real estate on the Fly and you could do that you know with that with with digital a fraud you can you can just instantiate space on
 correct you just make it up out of thin air right so whether it's a site you know they could set up a fake site they put some adtec on there and they can start running apps right it's literally that easy so it's very different than in the physical world where you actually have to put up a billboard right so you know in this case that's why it what I meant by it's it's virtually infinte you can create as much space as you need cuz all these fake websites in you know last Collins from the end of 2016 verisign reported 329 million domains registered right so even if you assume a half of those carry ads and the other half doesn't that still about a hundred and sixty million websites right if you think about where humans go and you probably heard of the Alexa top million websites right those are probably were most of the humans go right so the first million website is where majority 99.999% of humans go what
 who's going to the second million through the 160 million domains right so for some of these long till sites I just ended up themselves don't have enough traffic and so you know in the early days of programmatic they started resorting to just buying the traffic and of these days the bad guys even skip that stuff they don't even have sites where any humans go they don't put any content on them all they have to do is stick somatic on there and just buy one hundred percent of the traffic and when you buy traffic you know again it's not like there's a whole bunch of human sitting around with nothing to do but to go to that specific website that you tell them to go to write so what do you think to get all the traffic right it's all manufactured out of thin air like we were saying before the all of this can be in a little late built on top of computation and servers in the cloud and stuff like that the sketchy website I think of people who have less
 the show understand the skin of a scam or you could set up a WordPress site and you can just have these sketchy websites where you're just funneling fake traffic to it to view the ads up you would understand that scheme at this point the schemes that that I've seen more recently that are really vicious are the mobile advertising schemes because it's really easy to similar to do AdSense you need to just drop in a little script and it's going to run ads whenever you have a user and you can have you know you can have Farms of phones or you could also just do add stacking within the phones I think people have sense and it's it's not based on any kind of reality but people have a sense that for some reason mobile if you have a mobile app and there's ads on the app I think it feels a little more real than a browser but there's there's no reason why that's the case is so that's that's interesting topic that I would love to touch on but really you think I want it all or jump to real quick as I was talking to Shaolin
 a couple nights ago and I was asking him you know it's like okay so search search advertising that's Google's cash cow in it also have talked about Facebook's Cash Cow which is the Facebook ad you put the Cirque de search add unit I was like you know this is the biggest this is Google's biggest source of Revenue and if you know it seems like their hands are clean on that right because I mean if a Google who owns the entire pipe a user entered in a search they get 10 Blue Links there's no Windows 10 Blue Links have ended by Google if I am a marketer I go to Google to purchase that in order for there to be some sort of fraud there needs to be a third party title Mann Opportunity for kind of the to do the the fraudulent publishing you need a fake exactly right it's an outlet so so the blanket statement we can't say Google is all clean and we can't say Google is all fraud because there's two parts to it right so for the ads that
 turn on google.com those are pretty clean and the box that were talking about are not ramp and stare that's because they can make money there so if the ad runs on google.com and someone clicks then Google makes the money so these kind of fraud Bots are not going to waste their time doing that cuz they can't make money from it right so on the other hand if you have a Google search partner sites that carries the ads then they can increase your own ad Revenue by using Bots to click on a whole bunch of stuff right so when you have that opportunity to inflate your own Revenue you know people who are not scrupulous will just cross over and start buying the by traffic and using that to what is a Google search partner explain what that is
 so are you say easier one like a WebMD Sprite show WebMD you know some sites most site we're not going to build their own search advertising platform right so they just partner with a company like Google or Microsoft to this specific case WebMD and everyday Health are Microsoft search partner sites which means when you type in a search turn on WebMD you'll get you know site results on WebMD and you also get some paid results based on the keyboard right those are actually served into the site from Microsoft's search Network in that case WebMD is a search partner that uses the kind of the infrastructure that Microsoft has for search advertising right so in that case that's an example of a third-party now I mean I think webmd's doing the right thing they're not deliberately out the cheat so you don't see rampant amount of bots going on there but you imagine a smaller site right I think they there's not enough Humans 2
 add Revenue what did they turn into they start turning to bots to do that so in that case you know when we turn on search partner Network we expose ourselves to the risk of some of these sites that are not escrupulos right not a squeaky clean and actually turn to teach artificial methods of generating search ads and clicks so that they can increase their own ad rep you have to break Google into two parts right or break Microsoft into Parks and Rec Facebook into two parts anything that's on the main site or Maine property on google.com is probably going to have far less spots in front but anytime you get into the search partner Network or like in the case of Facebook and you get into the at exchange part of it which is all the sites outside of Facebook itself that's where you have the financial motive for those sites to commit fraud because they want to grow their revenue
 so they see that difference like the referring to if I want to set up beef recipes.com and make it a Google search partner I put a little search bar at the top of my page and then you can search for beef recipes in addition to the beef recipe search you're going to get 10 you're going to get a couple a couple search ads when Google reports their revenue and it says I think 20 or 25% AdSense the display ads and it's like 75 or 73% search advertising are the search Partners is is that Revenue bundled into that 73% cuz they don't break out what happened on Google's made property versus everything else it's just search Revenue right through we have so no idea what percentages is Google like safe you know safetrack direct correct so it's so the simple story for buyers is if you want to be safe from this kind of risk is
 check the check box like say to Google I only want my ads to appear on Google's main property not on any of the outside properties so that's going to be a first step to reduce your risk of later if you need to go to the search party Network so for example in Microsoft for some Pharma advertisers they actually have to turn on search partner Network because they want WebMD and they want everyday Health Zone those cases when they turn that on it's almost like you have two black was the other 99% right that are not those but unfortunately most of these at exchangers are search search platforms don't allow you to whitelist they only allow you to Blacklist so like you'll be super easy if I could just wipe my ass and have those two in there right I only want my ads to show up on those but again the way it's been set up over the years is that you have to say I don't want my ads to show up on all these other sites
 and oh by the way that field is limited to 10,000 roast so I mean for showing my clients week maxed out all of that all 10000 Rose and then every month we just put in the top 10,000 most egregious search Parker sites in there just to cut down on the front

 yeah that's of The Blacklist first Wireless thinks it's kind of interesting night I'm talking to Mark Goldberg about that in a while couple days I think and you know the basic of the premises if you're going to run ads on the site and your if your advertising you want to run ads on the site but you're aware of the fraud problem you and you have the choice of creating a blacklist or a whitelist the his Approach at least is you want to create a whitelist because there are the number of things that you would want to Black List is so long it's so largest it here and probably in an hour we could enumerate the sites that we visited in the last year and we would just whitelist those cuz those will be the size we want to run ads on so there's no she will Blacklist seems kind of crazy well that's the way
 these platforms have been built as if they didn't assume you would have to put in more than 10,000 right now but that was before you know a lot of people were even aware of how rapping at fraud is going to be alright and how easy programmatic has made it so that you can just create tens of thousands of fake websites and then add them in so you know I think when the those platforms for built a really didn't contemplate solving for this kind of problem right but but long story short I think most marketers should have both Blacklist and whitelist so this is very similar to say targeting right you might say you want to Target the us but it would also be useful to negative Target other countries like literally negative Target Russia China India those high places cuz most of these platforms are not perfect and so what you want to do is you positively Target something and a negatively Target something else right so that makes it even more clean so similar
 play you would use both whitelist and Blacklist where you have the opportunity right A lot of these platforms don't have a place where you can put in a whitelist but you know if you can do both do both know there's a there's an underlying assumption to both of this to both of these lists and that is the accuracy of the list right so if the domain that's being declared is actually the real domain where the ad is going to run then when you check it against the wireless or Blacklist you you don't can actually take that kind of action but what is the bad guy just lies about the domain right so let me play out a scenario here if you have fake sites like fake site one two three.com and you put that in the big request and try to get the kids or going to try to get at no one's going to pay it on your site cuz they can see it's a fake site so every fake site has to pretend to be a good site so they would go in there and say yeah
 ESPN or yeah I mostly Journal Yan New York Times right and they put that into the bid request so that they can actually get this right because marketers if they see fix that one two three.com they would never put in a bit but if they see New York time for ESPN does the oh yeah I want a bid on that when they did and then when they win then the add runs right and then the fraud detection runs because at the time of the bid request fraud detection all these tags have not run yet so I only when the ad is served and the fraud detection that rides along with the add I get to run and then they can check to see if you're that is in fact the site that it said it was right now that also relies on the fact that you would actually go back and you know check through your place reports and then see check out those discrepancies right but unfortunately most your buyers need advise and all that don't do that second step afterwards so they kind of just look at the police report
 add what do you think you're going to see in those patient reports night it's going to be all legitimate sites because the bad guys fake sites have to pretend to be a legitimate site in order to sell their inventory right so again that's what I mean by you have to determine the accuracy of those list otherwise your Blacklist and whitelist approach won't matter because you're not actually getting the real site on which the ad was ultimately served
 right yeah that makes sense so one thing I want to ask you about the Mark was telling me is he said Twitter is the source of a lot of problems in I guess measurability understanding what percentage of traffic is fake and what is real how is Twitter a source of problems in the ad fraud landscape well there's a couple of things you know you've all heard in the news about Twitter Bots and how they were used to amplify tweets right they would just read tweet and retweet and then dishes amplify those messages and that had a role to play in the 2016 elections so there there's box and fake accounts all they have 7 people known about that for a long time however I think he's referring to the fact that mopop right is now owned by Twitter and that's the mobile network
 that what I am seeing in the data is that there could be a lot of fraud that appears to be coming from mopop but I used to think that it was because of the apps and because of mopub itself but now we have recent evidence to maybe cut refute the hypothesis there may be bad guys that are deliberately saying that they're mopop show that mopop gets in trouble and the bad guys don't get in trouble right so you know it's not like the false flag Concepts in war right where you're hanging a flag this as your mopop right so if people see that there's fraud and they said always mopop that they call it dope up and say oh what were you no work using your front so there's some of that going on as well so it's not a hundred percent certain whether it's actually mopub causing the fraud but I'll tell you you know like you alluded to you earlier in the mobile space fraud is even more rapid so
 yeah I publish a few things I'm working on a study right now where was seeing literally 100% mobile front right literally 100 every single add impression is fragile and several layers to it right so in the desktop side it's on it's like you have to have a web page that runs the ad and then you have a visitor go hit the page right so typically fraud detection will the tax whether that visitor is a botter human rights Odell report on the bots in the mobile case none of that applies because like you said earlier the app itself could be bad acting right so the app like an alarm clock app for example will be loading 10,000 dad's at impressions in the background and most of that is in the 8 hours when the persons actually asleep so the at the app itself is committing the front now in that case there's no bot hitting a web page by so those
 detection technology companies looking for Boss they won't find any Bots there right it's literally the app that just loaded tons and tons of Impressions it's the best one layer the second layer in Mobile fraud what is that there's also fake devices so what if you had a fake mobile device download that app right and then run it right it's not even a human's device that downloaded that app cuz there's a whole bunch of these apps that I know of no humans who would ever have heard of it let alone downloaded it and uses it 24 hours a day 7 days a week so I mean there's been studies from other or malware kind of tracking companies where they seen what they call these fake mobile devices or what they called mobile simulators right so it's basically a software program that emulates a mobile device and the legitimate use of that is like developers would use that to test their apps right so that means that mobile
 emulator can download and install the app and then they can open and interact with the app like that's what those mobile simulators do so now if you take that mobile simulator with your software and you spit up 100 million copies of that in a data center now you have a hundred million mobile devices that can download and install apps right so I don't know if you remember a few months ago I take in a day timeframe Google kicked out 40 apps that purportedly had what they called a Judy malware on it so it was 40 apps it's not 4000 * 4 million out of 40 apps but those 40 apps were downloaded by 36 million devices now most of those devices uniform arcade that we could see that they were fake devices cuz you know it's not a real Humans mobile devices just in Mobile simulate so when you do that you have 40 apps * 36 million
 prices how long do you think it would take each device to low 30 ad Impressions does it take a day probably not take an hour no probably a minute to load 30 ad impression that means one at every 2 seconds course 30 ads x 36 million fake devices is 1 billion at Impressions that can be generated by the spot net of 36 million fake devices so that's how rampant fraught is because there's bad ass and there's fake devices when I talk to people about this problem sometimes I put chicken with their people in marketing I'm in San Francisco so I think of the the marketing people I talk to are pretty data-driven it's what I talk to them about this problem they kind of said well the reason this is a really big deal is because the the advertising people really care about these days is direct response it's measurable it's cost per
 version it's it's cost per acquisition cost per acquisition so like you're you're worried about how many how much add dollars do I have to spend to get a customer and as long as I'm spending $50 to acquire a customer that's going to generate $100 then I'm totally fine and it doesn't matter if I waste too mad spend so do you have a sense for what percentage of add spend on the Internet is spent with with with that kind of mentality with the cost per acquisition with a with a copper conversion with the really funnel holistic funnel understanding and how much of it is brand advertise cuz the brand advertising that's the stuff that's really liable to to be wasted on fraud here yeah so I have a slide which kind of details to break down between what they called branding type spend versus performance I expand ISO performance
 includes the cost per lead cost for sale in that can accept it also includes search marketing because you in a search marketing you don't pay for the impression you only pay when you get to click so it is a form of High Performance Marketing so they break it into Brandy versus performance it's different for different Industries right so for example to travel in the hotel industry and maybe see a movie tickets in a retail they tend to be very focused on the performance side of things right cuz they can actually measure it all the way through to a transaction some of which happens online to they can really close the loop and then there's other entire categories like cpg or like movies when there's a big movie coming out you know date they tend to blow a ton of budget to generate awareness those are all branding related right cuz they just need as much reach and frequency as possible to make people aware right out the movie and maybe remind people of the beer that soda whatever showed up
 the industry certain industries are much more heavily weighted towards the branding side of things and and other Industries are much more performance-oriented to begin with but if you look at the digital span using the IB report 2/3 of digital spends it slightly going down in recent years but about 2/3 or 60% of the digital span is still in search so most of digital still performance-oriented even though lately with the rise of Facebook and the rise of programmatic it's been shifting more back towards the The Branding side because of the polymerization of display ads video ads mobile display and so on and so forth when you perform an audit for a brand or an agency
 describe that process like who is coming to you and saying hey I'm worried about this this issue is it a brand is an agency and and how does that progress yeah it's it's usually what I call the two endpoints right so on one side you have the advertisers you are paying out the dollars and then on the other endpoint you have the Publishers write these are the sites like a hearse to Colleen asked that carry the ads it's typically the endpoints that care right because again like I said in the past the middleman you make more money on the volume of ads that are shown so they really have no motive to cut down on the fraud and all that kind of stuff so it's typically talk about the brand side I still want a marketer see something and they read something and said no yes I may look strange here but I can't explain it you know our media buyers can explain it and then networks won't explain are those
 so don't worry we're clean right then the brand starts asking more questions and then they ask for help so when they ask for help I can use technology to go collect the data so yeah I'm being very specific about the words collect the data right it's not necessarily doing magic man or saying it's more for Less far to whatever it's collecting sufficient data so that we can actually see what's going on but in some cases we'll see okay look pretty clean you really don't have anything to worry about right but in other cases we might c o well here's an area here's a problem that you got to look deeper into right and so having more detailed data and analytics gives us the ability to figure out where the problem is as I sometimes use the analogy of a smoke detector right it just helps you kind of determine where to look for the fire right it doesn't help me put out the fire doesn't you just wanted to know what it's really knowing where to look and
 what to look for is important so that being said you know a lot of people out of Brands think you need Super advanced technology to detect this stuff you can and you may need it by why do we start with the low-hanging fruit right so I'll give you one example that I wrote about in the DNA analytics Journal direct marketing Association and literature and let's look at your own analytics and look for anything that smells smells fishy or something that looks strange for example straight lines so you know I use a traffic example right so when you turn on a botnet to hit a site you're going to see a vertical rise in the amount of traffic right goes straight up and then every hour is going to have the exact same amount of traffic as you just told about that kit this site X thousand times right so then you're going to see a straight horizontal line cuz every hour that the same exact amount of traffic and then when you turn off that thought that you see if vertical
 right so anytime you see straight lines in analytics something's wrong with that because humans don't move that way right so very simply if you look at normal traffic patterns from major Publishers right humans go to the site during waking hours and so you'll see more traffic during waking hours and then overnight human sleep so between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. that should be the lowest point of your traffic charts right on of every day and then furthermore there's a typical pattern of 5 + to write 5 week days usually have more traffic than the two weekend days so those are normal patterns and if you see so it's the same exact amount of traffic you know hour after hour day after day something's wrong with that right you don't need any advanced fraud detection technology to know something strange and then you look into that and say okay where is that coming from and then you can see the referrals and other things and you can say okay
 don't want to buy traffic I don't want to buy ads on those sites anymore because something strange so that's just an example where your marketers can now increasingly take matters into their own hands and start looking at things that they already have which are their own analytics to see if there's anything strange and then after those low-hanging fruit Arctic had taken care of then you apply more technology to help you to text each other the more advanced stuff right to all of those fraud detection technology companies are great and you can use them to cut oats us out additional fraud it's more advanced that's not so apparent in your own analytics by but again it's a multi-step process so the audit is typically that it's like they feel like something's wrong but they don't know what it is and can't explain it so that I go in and use data collection use technology to collect the data combine that with looking at their analytics and again because we've seen so much so
 over the years I know what to look for it so that case we can actually say hell yeah look here right this is something strange let's and it sometimes we might need to add some technology to help us your label that humans are boss or whatever and all of that helps us determine what's going on and then what steps to take afterwards so it's usually pretty straightforward the combination of technology and methodology

 these clients you have so yeah I talked to Charles in a couple times and he is working with some people right now who are some legal action that's going to take place I'm I'm pretty sure I don't know how much I can talk about that but these clients that you work with when they discover we just been bilked for hundreds of thousands tens of thousands or millions of dollars what recourse do they have and are they start to take advantage of that recourse
 I think that's starting now because they finally realize that that actually is fraught right but up till now most of them didn't realize that or they day Brady handed off a lot of their budget to a media buying agency so it's never really been the brand responsibility to do that they just assume someone else took care of it but now increasingly brands or again taking matters into their own hands so legal could be one recourse if they have but you know like I said you know before add fraud is not a legal right A lot of people don't understand that there's no law against it right now so that's why some of these bad guys or not necessarily bad guys are just hate arbitraging current opportunity right they can buy the ad impressions for very very low CP Adams and resell it to someone else is willing to pay more for it and keep the difference so that's like Free Enterprise in America right so you know they're not necessarily the bad guys that
 taking advantage of an opportunity but that's because add fraud itself hasn't been defined as illegal but if you look at other parallels right counterfeit handbags those brands that are guchies and you know the lvmh's of the world have recourse now because they can actually sue the people who made the fake items because you know they're taking away revenue and all that kind of stuff so there will be other parallels that we can draw from right so in this case in the case of add fraud marketers thought they were buying real Gucci handbags I mean real ad showing you real humans but in fact they find out oh we're not right someone sold us counterfeit ads just like counterfeit Handbags and so now some of them are realizing okay maybe we need to take legal action to to stop that
 in your travels are you talking to at exchanges or talking to Google or Facebook who are the Giants in the industry that you're having conversations with none of them there's not interested the ones who are have already reached out so you know it's pretty straightforward to say you know I don't need to keep banging my head against a brick wall try to convince people to do the right thing when they don't want to do the right thing so these days it's like that you know where to find me if you're interested in actually taking a look and doing something about it you know you know where to call me or email me or whatever right so you've heard the term fomo right fear of missing out of Fofo here right fofao fear of finding out is if a brand manager you know has been buying the stuff for years and years they don't actually want to find out that the stuff
 I've been doing for years and years has not been that great so they would rather just not find out let their agency keep doing what they're doing and you know it's it's probably better that way let's not rock the boat let's just keep everything the same so you know it takes someone with courage to say I really want to find out even if it might be bad news I'd rather know now rather than wait and waste more money on this so there's a lot of that going on right so even the brand managers the marketers themselves are only now coming around to it and say okay we probably better find out right if we can't just let it ride anymore so I think that's what's happening in and we're kind of all seeing that you know if marketers are really paying a lot more attention and that's a good thing for the industry because fraud has been rampid for so long and then so rampant now when the people who are actually taking money out of their pockets are actually paying attention
 something good is going to happen
 for the whole industry do you have a sense for how that tide is going to change like what's open what's it going to take like I'm watching tropical storm or the hurricane that just destroyed Houston like Houston is under water now and I think people are biting their tongue right now but I have a suspicion that this is going to be a change in how people think about climate change at what Like For Better or Worse more people are going to be convinced the climate change after this you have a red state that one of its major is biggest city gets thrown into water this is going to change how people talk about climate change is there an equivalent to vent that can happen that will make people start to take add fraud seriously
 no and you know why because all of us fraud researchers and other companies have been telling them it's a multibillion-dollar problem but whether we tell them it's a six billion dollar problem or 16 billion dollar problem or 29 billion-dollar problem we've told them that over years and nothing none of that has caused them to take action okay so that's not going to be it's not going to be some cataclysmic event where we tell them it's really really big and then they're going to go do something about it but it's going to be something else and what I think is going to happen you know we were racing examples of this so you've heard of the news where Chase reduced the number of sites that carry their ads from 500000 to 5000 that is a 99% decrease and they saw no change in business outcomes okay and then P&G you know subsequent to that they cut a hundred forty million dollars out of Q2 digital ads
 and he saw no change in Brazil comes with that you know 30 take away that most brand should have is like oh well we should go run our own experiments right not all of them will be cutting 140 million out of their budget but what if you cut 5% what if you cut 10% run that experiment for yourself and the thing that's common to both of those experiments that these Brands ran Chase and P&G is that they looked at business outcomes did that spanned actually drive any business outcomes and did the reduction of that spans actually drive and you know lead to any reduction business outcomes in both cases it was no so that means whatever they were spending in those cases did not drive productive business outcomes anyway so it's not even whether it's fraud and not right if it's not driving business outcomes there's no reason for you to keep investing it right
 that case you 31 take away from this entire show it would be for the Brand's actually go run their own experiments because when they do they will actually kind of see reality and start to understand you know where the Investments are not paying off so once they know where that what you know what's causing that then they can say let's reallocate those dollars or something it's actually going to pay off for us so you know getting back to you what you said earlier like the brand advertising first as a performance once some of the brand advertisers might actually be better served going back to TV because if they need brand reach and I need reaching frequency
 there is no medium better than TV to achieve it right digital is inherently performing to medium and so you know it's sub-optimal to use it strictly for reaching frequency and I tribute a lot of the fraud a Droid two people using digital incorrectly if they want more reach and it just keeps laying by me as much impressions as many billions upon billions of impressions as possible that's what led to the front because there just aren't enough humans sitting around with nothing to do but to go to website and generate a fusion generator at Impressions whereas there's unlimited Bots the bad guys can create to create unlimited at impression to absorb all of those marketing dollars so in that case when your ammo in digital is by me as much as possible
 you are exposing yourself to you know enormous risk of fraught because bad guys love that they just want to absorb all your money if you're if that's your sole objective however if these brand start realizing okay well let's actually focus on business outcomes not on how much we buy then that's going to be a better way of thinking for the entire industry a lot of people say they're already doing that but number of Impressions / the cost that you pay is not business outcomes right that's that's what's been reported you know by a lot of the reports it and get back and that's not r a y right so you focus on real or a why based on your own business outcomes and then you'll start to realize what actually driving that and what's not driving that and then you can spend your money better
 and I think a lot of brand or just on do that now
 Facebook is an interesting story we could talk about here I think I feel like Facebook is even harder to audit then perhaps you can Google do you have any thoughts on how much of Facebook traffic or Instagram traffic the campaign I mean advantage of a Facebook what's what's nice about Facebook at least in the long run is it is more of a walled-off ecosystem in a Chrome browser then that's kind of like a authentic cated ecosystem that's really the the issue they were thinking about here is there is there a layer of authentication that is recording your data so that you can be proven to be a human when your views are being sold on the internet if the the publisher and in this case Google or Facebook can detect that your human
 brew a large sample set of your actions taken across the internet then your your impressions your actions are much more valuable than if they cannot prove who you are because the null hypothesis is that your robot there's just so many more bots in there are humans on the internet that so yeah that's that's that's directionally correct but I would simplify to say you follow the money and you boil it down to whether the pots have a financial incentive to do suffer not so logged in environments are generally better right so when your login to Gmail and you're logged into various Google services they have some information about you and they might even see you walking around the physical world right cuz when you have when your login on your Android device still don't have geotrace and all that kind of stuff with Facebook in a login environment it's generally better it's more human than all that but you know Bots can also maintain a couch right they can be logged into Twitter and tweet thanks Casey
 simply being logged in is not enough you have to look at whether the boss have a financial motive right if they can make money at it they probably would if they can't make money at it they probably won't waste your time cuz there's other things I can be doing that Jackson making the money so comes back to what we already talked about earlier in the show which is on google.com right there's probably not a lot of thoughts ramp in there because they can't make money when they had loads there and gets clicked Google make some money similarly on Facebook it sell for in Twitter itself right you're going to have the same phenomenon where the pots can't make money or they don't make money that's why they're not going to waste their time doing it right so in those cases it's it's not so much about being logged in or not cuz pots candy login as well it's more about whether the Box have a financial motive to act or not right so on the main property that's why those things are cleaner now people in the industry of a kind of accused Facebook
 oh well you won't let us measure or so you must be hiding something right okay that's possible right it's better if they did let the industry-standard bodies I measure them however I don't even care about that I what I'm seeing the data coming from my clients campaigns and we only look at the clicks coming from Facebook to say a landing page that we're tracking the clicks coming from Facebook are far far more human than clicks coming from other sources of media right so that case I'm only looking at the outcomes did we actually see a human click through from a Facebook ad versus the percentage of humans a click-through from other ass whether it's search a door display at in this case because that channel are you Facebook is sending us more humans and other channels are sending us less humans and more Bots it's a very simple thing for the marketer to do to optimize their spent it's Alec
 more dollars to channels that are sending them or humans so this case I don't actually have to measure on Facebook itself I can see the outcomes people are clicking on the ads from Facebook and coming to my site and I can confirm that they're humans so that case when we see way way more humans coming from Facebook that's a good investment right so there's a lot of those kind of fact is even if I can't measure on Facebook itself I'm still seeing good results and that's what matters to you as a marketer switch back to Google there was something recently earlier this week or last week where Google refunded some partners for some add fraud stuff what happened what what happened there welder trying to be proactive about it because you know the alternative is far worse than that and more embarrassing so I think they started to realize that a portion
 right they're not going to say a lot but they're going to say a portion of the inventories actually faked right so this goes back to what we talked about earlier which are fake sites can only sell their inventory by pretending to be legitimate sites right show a fake sites going to pretend to be ESPN in order to sell their inventory on exchanges so when Google sees that right and they can see it right it's this site ID and all that goes up even if in the big requested it says it's ESPN it but it's not Google can see that and what they went out went ahead and did is they refunded the double-quick fees right so Google because it ran on double-click they took some fees and now Google refunded that so I think it's a step in the right direction but what a lot of people haven't talked about is the fact that the marketer still haven't gotten their money back from the at exchange that we know where the pipes and that the ultimate fake site that carry hat and they may never again
 call you back cuz once that money is spent in gone to those fake sites you're never going to see those dollars again right so I think what Google is doing is its distancing itself from the fraudsters who actually owns those sites but the marketer only got a small portion of their money back from Google but they still have to go chase the other at exchanges that ultimately sold the a bad impression and the ultimate site that Randy a depression right so they're still a lot to that story but I think it's a step in the right direction and Google's trying to do the right thing but again it's it's not it may not be enough right there still much more work to be done to wrap up what else you seeing that interesting or alarming that we have not discussed I'm I think we've got it covered in that that was kind of mobile side so I mean the mobile site is kind of new frontier still I mean because
 you know only recently did mobile spans get to be greater than 50% of digital ad spend night so now mobile is the majority spend but mobile is you know mostly in-app Impressions and those are the ones that can't be measured by fraud detection technology companies now there are fraud detection sdks but the bad guys apps don't install fraud detection SDK seen them right so what we're seeing what were able to measure are the good apps so of course we're seeing low fraud case were only measuring the good apps we're not measuring the 99% other apps that are not good right so there's a lot of still kind of misunderstanding or I would call it Miss information in people's minds cuz they think mobile is cleaner has no fraud don't worry about it but if I were to leave one t message it would be now is the time to be more
 mortgage lender never not less Vigilant than ever because just know that the bad guys are hackers and stay have better Tech than you do and their MO is to find ways and work around so that they can continue making money so they will find ways around your block in your filter in your fraud detection everything because their livelihood depends on it so they will do that so even if your frog attack reports tell you it's all clean don't just assume that and do nothing else right look at other things like your own analytics to see if you can corroborate that see if that even makes sense right so if they're fraud Reports say it's clean but then in your own analytics you see the same amount of traffic every hour of every day something's still wrong with that go ask the hard questions right so don't just assume it's okay because the fog report say it's okay it's time to be more Vigilant. Less vision
 alright Augustine Foo Thanks for coming back on software engineering daily it's always a pleasure to talk to you and look through your alarming slides that's that's what's fun so thank you for asking to be on again and you know hopefully you know the industry will continue kind of taking Snaps and see and I think it bodes well for the entire I just roll advertising ecosystem alright sounds good Tre
 we are partnering with indeed Prime to make some tips about how to thrive in the modern workplace you're looking for a new job you can check out indeed.com SE daily today's tip is about how to learn material and how to meet the right people to get you into a new job much of getting a new job is about learning something new or having knowledge of something that you didn't have when you started your previous job that lets you get leverage from the past education you've had and apply it to a new role so there are lots of people interested in moving into a i machine learning or deep learning is people interested in getting into security devops all of these different engineering verticals have huge repositories of content and a lot of them are free is a lot of free ebooks and website
 There's real books you can obviously by the best books off in from O'Reilly O'Reilly has some great books on specific verticals and I think one thing about book is that most people don't read them so if you actually take the time to read a book like let's say you're looking for a job in artificial intelligence / machine learning and you have no experience in that and you take a couple months between your job your current job and then you're going to start looking for a job you take two months to learn stuff if you just read the Deep learning book from Ian Goodfellow Yoshua bengio and Aaron Courville if you just read that book before starting to look for a job and then once you were interviewing for these machine learning positions you could say yeah I read this entire text book about deep learning
 that would give you such a leg up on many other candidates and probably give you enough knowledge to move completely into a new field for easier ways of moving into a field in Reading at our textbook there are obviously online courses or in-person courses you can do side projects a side project is often the best way to learn something in a Hands-On fashion I was never a great reader of textbooks or do or of online courses but side projects always help me learn really effectively a more condensed version of that might be a hackathon hackathons aren't for everyone eat but sometimes getting into a room with a bunch of other people that are hacking can give you some inspiration and the inspiration will drive you through the project and the project is such a powerful learning experience Brother people who are trying to learn there are meetups and conferences these are very social environments for learning so if you're a great extrovert
 and you learned through extraversion you like to sit down with people over lunch or coffee or you know absorb the material that is coming off the stage from the speaker is meetups in conferences can be really great there's also remote conferences these days they give you a little bit of the online course appeal together with the conference appeal and there's Twitter I love Twitter I learned so much from Twitter I use Twitter all the time everyday and I still know people who don't use Twitter really think they're missing out at this point something has happened recently work Twitter has become just this really powerful tool for learning I think of something around the presidency just brought a ton of people online on to Twitter where the producing great content and its if you haven't use Twitter as an educational tool I really suggest it
 and of course if you're trying to learn material while you are what you have a full-time job just give me really hard and you got to figure out how to fit learning into your day if you're listening to this podcast you've are you obviously figured out something because you have time to listen to the software engineering podcast you listen all the way through to the end of this episode and that's a great place to start I know I've learned most of the most of the Cutting Edge material about software from podcast obviously fitting that into your day works if you want to read a book or if you want to fit side projects into your schedule I can be more tricky but scheduling time on your calendar I find it I can be a good reinforcement for some people only if your job supports you learning new technologies maybe there's time during your work day or people at your current job who can educate you and guide you through the
 process I know that when I worked at Amazon it was such a big organization and people really encouraged to go to different sections of the organization have conversations with people it was like a big university if you have you work at a hundred plus person organization software engineering organizations attractive very smart people and there's all kinds of interesting people you could meet with you can meet with one person for coffee every week from random person in the company and very quickly would understand everything about the company so something's up everyone I encourage people to learn new material and it will help you find a new job that will help you get to a new job if you are looking for a new job you can be inspired and get that new material that'll get you towards your new job and once you're ready to shift to a new job Indeed Prime go to indeed.com SE daily and you can find out more about how indeed helps you find a job from Graton

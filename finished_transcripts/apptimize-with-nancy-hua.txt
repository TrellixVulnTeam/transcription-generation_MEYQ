Transcription: Nancy who is the CEO and co-founder of apptimize which simplifies a b testing for mobile applications algorithmic trading in the financial industry daily thanks Jeff hello let's talk about you do a b testing for apps can you give an example of how a customer would use apptimize yes a lot of our customers Lake hotel tonight or truly a Capital One so he's companies still use this to make changes instantly to their native mobile experiences on Android iOS and send the different versions me from people to see what converts better what gets them to ring a turkey at War so it's all about figuring out what the optimal user experience on mobile is
how are most of your clients a b testing prior to starting to use apptimize
 let's see what they'll do they'll probably make changes their app according to their deployment schedule which is usually a month to several months and
 in between appointments so just observe their analytics and see what the impact is on their customers and then there's kind of compare and stuff is going up or down anything it's really hard because every deployment there's a ton of sweet in there and then it's very difficult to see what what thing is having a fact that you're observing or if it's just seasonality or something like that
 does optimize typically get used by companies that are doing this
 patch deployment system are are there also companies that do continuous integration of continuous deployment it also use have to Mize do you think you're fighting and staged rollout tutoring teachers like primitive ways to do that that Google is trying to enforce but you can't believe all back to Future's or do a lot of stuff so we let you have a lot more control on this is more how advanced apps are operating like they don't really have this appointment schedule that everyone else is usually operating off of they they try to release much more frequently and just moves
 try tomorrow AdAway of women on mobile which is pretty hard to deal with your family got some ice so you kind of use us to find all your features and control when you're ready to send it to assess the customers and then it is i r a c k latest it's Spider-Man figures out all of the visual men so that you can go on her website and make those changes and also I'm if you're using us to basically manage different versions of different features or on control who gets which feature then you can integrate our will you put these little tags in those places so that you can use our dashboard triple other features the different audiences
 pastor of you you said I like the idea of eliminating developer time as much as possible you said the vast majority of what we think we need developer for are not what we need to be lovers for what are the things that we actually need Developers for and how does optimize cut down the time that developers spend on other stuff I think you need Developers for like pretty complex logic or I'm figuring out how different systems talk to each other or organized I'm more sexual things and things that are just like front end engineering of layouts and stuff and how different clothes work and usually that's pretty
 that type of logic you know you don't really need to know how to program to figure out so empowering people who don't want you code or don't like even developers and I don't know what they think is fun let it there that doesn't need to be if we make them laugh and the power of the people to do it without having to learn all of this thing works in tools that I think that's going to open up a lot of stuff and also make them a lot faster I think it's just like how does this like an Ashley when you only people who are really expert in whatever like I remember when I was like using. I'm still I don't know like that is not the case anymore like anyone can you do anything so pretty and stuff like that I wanted to send an email
 baby let everyone to see their jobs easier I think it also lets developers do their jobs a lot easier to if they're not fussing over all of the different ways you had to deal with the flow of your app and on all these different places and stuff like that if you know it's him that work that's mine just let us handle it then that's a lot easier wobble bikers to do a lot a lot of stuff without having to get it put on a development without extra programming or tagging and I'm very curious about how after my zucchi's achieves that so
 we can see anything that the app is sending to the operating system so if you already tagged something with third-party sbk that you're trying to track like if you're using Google analytics store mixpanel I monitor then we will Autumn it automatically pick that up and see that you're trying to track obituary in a little while so just track it as well so you don't need to retag everything to the point yet another analytics paperwork that lets you track everything will be just handle your dating one place and then without you doing anything and then we also allow you to use our visual interface to walk to the app and track news things that you haven't tracked before cuz it's pretty common that people like you don't know all the things you want or you can implantation his mobile QA is it a pretty on some problem in a lot of cases do so if you can track it for whatever reason you can go through their app and check wipes testers
 button pushes views I'm using that editor you have siloed iOS people in siloed Android people and Silo salad web people does this seem unsustainable to you cuz it seems like a really terrible waste of your time in the long-term yeah there's a lot of ways that we can address this I think right now if you're really
 flashlight on your mobile strategy then you really have an option other than to do to do that because like the reason that you're investing all these negative experiences is because it just better and I mean that's just how all these operating systems are designed to be the whale sound like native development if you want to do more like to use instead or you can you send these other Technologies I'm not sure if it was actually mean anything on react yet but I saw that they finally released or Android thing and then there's an ionic and there's a bunch of different options there to explore but that's more for I'm coming over cuz mine's for games I don't know what you have to like see where you are in your strategy if it's like you're still proving out the value of mobile for you or if you're really really resource-constrained then
 pretty good alternative for you may just want to make you know whether she has to think about what are your goals for for mobile
 she just finished a week of shows about react and Facebook did just released at react native for Android mail today for iOS a while ago it look in the past I've seen these different types of like Rite Aid in JavaScript and then magically click a button and important to iOS or Android these things tend to seem kind of janky when you actually try to use them I can just make some app with some web views and it's not really like productive enough do you think there is the potential for an actual solution like react or I think the image ionic these other things where you could just write write it once and then have a solid port to the native platforms like is this an achievable future
 well I don't know what's going to happen is Rollins in like 20 years or was like the pens on where you are if you want to be really cutting edge with stuff then like you know you're probably going to still develop needed way but if you're cool with how they're doing everything on a 12 V and you also take advantage of it supposed to do that I think it's just always treated with how their they're thinking about simplifying that holds about men experience because I think it's way too painful and it's just about how are you want to prioritize like your customer experience you to have the best of both worlds
 went Lake I do want us to bet on it and somebody technology in a bunch of ways but I'm still looking to see which one is actually most in tune with what they're going to do because we work like they are customers I don't think they're going to be using any of these anytime soon as I think there's always a first one
 what types of ways would you make bets like to sit around and plant about it and then likes cuz her to settle down to something like I have these the stuff that we do isn't like fundamentally about any like we are our value is about letting you faster so we can still let you control which feature is different types test go into web for work with any of these black worms in his throat is very similar like that I pop is still just like making it easy even easier for you to figure out what your customer is why I didn't like him and I also have our control over your user experience for a different customers
 why would it be dangerous to go to the web kind of waste of time because I think that is going to die I mean technologically a pretty solid easier problem there's other options are whether the album Isley has agree that I don't know there's so much stuff on what I've already so you can try and said I don't think hasn't kubaton lab cuz they have there in a lot of really big companies that have a really strong my present so I don't know with with everything I just think it's just not aligned with what at my cell. Which is making mobile Innovation easier so I'm on for stuff like that that's not really up our alley in terms of our technological advantages and much refer to partner
 interesting I'd like to talk some about y combinator you graduate from my commentary in Spring 2013 what did y combinator offer you and apptimize that you couldn't get elsewhere so I think I was like well and I already knew a lot of them but they all still really strongly recommended Y combinator and now one of my best friends are y combinator Founders so I know that was awesome everyone really hasn't added you to pay it forward and helping each other and I love to do that too so I don't know gives me the warm fuzzies you think you can get the network in indirect ways
 120 K right well I didn't even last because they gave us 20 or 25 and then the rest of the money was from what they're hiring at the time by CBC fund which actually is a separate like it just separate money that we got that we also had to give equity for but later at a different valuation much the 7% which was I don't know whatever 7% of x equals 22
 I don't know I think it's worth it because it made fundraising a lot easier and also just the amount of
 play helping Brian from the network it's really hard to put a value on that so I don't know when it becomes not worth it anymore but it's really all that you've been co-opted into the Y combinator Kool-Aid Club
 I think it interesting Maybe
 weight of the people who do I contact her multiple times because they probably already have the network that they must be really value is like the ultimate experience and also like the whole experience of doing all the dinners partner yeah sure so I don't know they're getting a lot out of it I think I don't know I don't really think too much about exponentially worth more worthwhile than whatever the second-place accelerator is
 tell Heather you need for strong internationally and white and has like through the roof admission but I don't know where all like you want to look at the network of the accelerator though because I think that's where most of the benefit comes from so you have other people I see you
 what is Sam Altman's most ambitious optimal future fight, Nate yeah an exam is
 does
 really strong like in the vision yeah when I talk with people I got really inspired so I'm sure he's thinking that he's going to invest in stuff that's like way too risky and also probably have a huge influence over her how Angel Investing and BC works and totally appreciate that he has Stones you're there an image in very decisively anti becoming a series series a company upside potential High volatility
 yeah if you can do anything
 very interesting what are the technical ways that your engineering organization benefited from being in y combinator is more about strategic funding stuff yeah we just
 when are where in that I did have a conversation with Eric for insano who's one of the other wise the alarms about how he implemented his own cuz there's other there's another thing called clutch i o which I think I should at least open source employment options and we were attempting to use that before we started asking is because it wasn't like I just wanted to start this like Milwaukee violations and work on day one and I looked at it what else is out there when I use one of them and I'm over talking with him about that I think I had some influence over cuz you made a lot of the growth of organized in Ford during the experiences that we had a good-looking crap on demo day
 write the good-looking graphs of what did your graph look like and what you don't like this evening and make it to the exact because I like number of our users users have a pretty good-looking guy out there because you know it's really easy and you just make sure other people as well yeah I don't know if he sees it really caught on to this vanity metrics late like you don't really care about it
 look at is like dollar per that number so that I know that our users users were not like going to just suddenly
 I have this need a hundred grand per month Amazon bill or even worse I guess if they had no tens of millions of Amazon like AWS expenditure as your demo days graph shows on y combinator in the future and what what do you think are the best questions to ask around engineering during that week being in an accelerator and hacking away at a project of context to be Engineering in or maybe I'm mistaken but topics to cover
 probably prioritization of you never have enough time like you sure your engineering team is awesome but they're just never going to get to everything is on the road now they've got requested they got issues that they're finding with your your product and you also have like all of the stuff that you want to eventually refactor that will you ever get there I'm so I think that party they should that's like really the thing that you should be spending a lot of time on the beginning before you describe it in code and I think that's what we realize because ozone we are like
 and usually no like that really makes you feel like understand like what you ask is most important to get right and what you actually is okay to like it more when I get there they're already committed your products just so they can have a little more pain baby
 interesting to this week on software engineering daily is about women in engineering so we should talk some about that topic but first I guess I totally dislike this framing because the women in Tech issue maybe distract from the fact that these women are actually doing work in tap and I have to spend all this time or they or they are just questions they have to spend time discussing women in Tech rather than attack itself change things I don't know like what do you what do you think about this is actually important to talk about the women in Tech issue explicitly interesting
 yeah I think it's pretty
 super issues in general I think that as long as that issue exists
 you can ignore it so as long as racism exists you can ignore race as long as sexism exhaust you can ignore gender so
 yeah I don't think I think it's it's in some ways irresponsible to just wash your hands of the thing and he likes is nothing to do with me I'm going to like with my life because I don't know you're just saying like I refuse to take responsibility for this topic for other people because it's not enough of a problem for me I figured out how to handle it for myself but you know it's I'm fine which is a very seductive line of thought about so the thing that makes me more time to talk about it is thinking about other people that are struggling with something somewhere and
 I have to be responsible for them as well and to try to make sure that day
 yeah there's not a ton of the service done to them because they can't handle it the way I've been handling it or that they don't have my privileges
 there's only disadvantages there's probably some ways advantages or I don't know if that's just me looking at this like the bright side of everything what I think are the disadvantages was thinking every like human interaction
 show different it can be hard so if you're unique and that you're like the one woman in the conversation or the one when in the room it just going to be very difficult for you to escape how the human brain naturally pattern matches
 the status quo and when things deviate from that so women know that they're different they're different and Men know that the women are different when they're different and save everybody so I think that yeah like when you know when I see you like when I'm interviewing an engineer who is very different because they're willing or because of their race or because of whatever like I know that they're different I know they haven't interviewed like 10 other people like my five of their interviews were like this other profile now it's the other person and I'm sure that I had it seems like the conscious Pisces so I weigh
 I try to deal with that is through having a scorecard that's really systematic and so I know that like I'm bothering them according to this pressure they already said Advance before meeting them they're not just like inventing you showed up but yeah there's a ton of stuff like I don't know usually when will see what will happen
 well I think I'm I'm pretty so how do I counter like usually people I think when they need me they expect me to not be the CEO they expect me to be maybe a marketing person of a fashion startup or something like that and yeah you know what they said me a different and I just kind of like very immediately I don't know maybe they don't pretty unfashionable that's like me being very flattering myself I don't know what they think I am but like you know and then yeah I don't know women have like a hardest time out of everyone out there but it's really hard to compare like different people's level of marginalization I'm sure like men's number to some degree as well but it just like they don't feel like they can talk about it
 I don't think it's like delivery on their part I think everyone is a bad person who would it will read through and I don't think these are really fat like that bad so I don't really feel like I deserve to complain about my sister we had a really good time but I don't know like occasionally so usually I did not bring my pills out there with me because you're supposed to just have one person focus on it and honestly he's like nah great if they would want to meet at more like I don't he just be there for whatever reason and I would notice that people would really look at him the whole time or like to read all the questions towards him and after talking with him about it he like never even picked up on that cuz he doesn't even make eye contact so he doesn't know there's like working and I'm like why are you clearly is really uncomfortable looking at you and I'm the one
 it's like talking and turning but I think it's just I don't know people are used to talking with men probably I don't think you're doing it on purpose and he never really even noticed it and I don't really even let it bother me too cuz on a scale of things that could happen and I think I just turned into like not bring him anyway so it didn't come up as much
 how do you think things are going to change in the future I'd like this degree of prejudice I guess you know today is a disadvantage I mean or maybe maybe you see this Prejudice as in you and I don't know maybe maybe there is a you know what a positive version of the Prejudice that could potentially Manifesto I don't know how do you see things changing in the future or if we should try to change it what are the ways that we should try to invoke that change
 I think I think the future is that all of these superficial properties of a person are going to be so valuable and fluid because people are going to be able to adjust a lot of the stuff so easily that it's not going to be a factor anymore like I think people are going to be able to change like this is I don't know how many years for something to change gender or like maybe like in their virtual anyone can just be anything they want any moment so who the hell cares about is out of this more about their personalities values I think how it changes is through setting an example of people be really successful so it's pretty cool there are a lot of female billionaires in China or female
 yeah I think you're pretty Kick-Ass and there are like female CEOs and the one we always think about is Marissa Mayer probably but there's also if it was just very awesome do they think that's when you know we start to adjust a lot of things and I think I just might happen if we all just try to be awesome and what we want to do and try to perform potential then it's in your blog you said you have friends aged 18 270 and you don't think about their ages the same way you said it you have advantages to being of a different being of a different gender than the prototypical male startup CEO how to use
 what are you gender-blind I know I definitely really aware of it but I do view it as like a pretty arbitrary a temporary thing I think I don't know how I feel about my own gender cuz I don't think I think about it too much it's not like I really wish I were another gender or I'm really happy it was my dad I don't know how you would feel if I woke up tomorrow and I was a man I probably just be like oh now you need to adjust to this new thing and not be very life I hate this I don't think I would hate it I think I'd be okay with it but I don't know I don't know maybe that's not true I've no idea how to deal with people who I mean I have friends who are transitioning from whatever desert whatever done to her and I think it's
 I don't know it's just like not a big deal they're still very similar to fundamentally to the person I know and it's like really weird and interesting to hear about their experiences doing that and I think I learned a lot from all of it but it's not it's not really like there for these are they all feelings to such a degree that they feel that they want to make this dramatic change so there's two good friends I have one in the menu from a mighty so I've known him for like I don't know one of those in years and then the other one I know from Silicon Valley so I think
 both really any sign of them they went different ways like wanted was a woman now I'm an another one and they both just really hate their original body like a lot but I knew that like I'm over with both of them one of the first conversations we ever had was like about how they did not like their body and they were like you know just really uncomfortable with their appearance and at some point I think they were just like whatever I'm going to make my body look the way I wanted to look and that's when they talk I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that cuz I don't know I'm very lucky I probably I always kind of like the way I look or didn't care a lot about it or I don't know it was just like very secondary to the other things they was fixated on so I bet I could see how that Ike
 once you are in a position to be able to do something about it make you feel a lot better because
 yeah if you really need something about yourself you should try to change it
 how can I be a better allies in the movement towards towards gender equality or more gender equality motivation for doing this week is like I've worked in a number of engineering organizations where I've seen women be marginalized and it's like frustrating to me as an engineer cuz I'm just like what is a get this shit done and we honestly cannot get the shit done because there's some marginalization whether it's subconscious or conscious and it's like holy crap this is so pervasive I wish it were not a problem so we can be more productive as an organization to like what can a male in an organization in a software engineer position do
 I think the times I've been most moved by how other people hit behaves is observing what they did was when they showed like a lot of compassion for the situation when they were really like their actions or so they were really kind of put themselves in the other person shoes and they
 I think that that message necessitate adding or it's like it requires having a really open mind and a strong degree of empathy for the other person and it's being really sensitive to all of that and not being like judging or really quick to you you know like just do whatever is easiest or something like that but it went black and passions and the situation becomes a lot more nuanced and you're more able to behave in a way that doesn't make anyone feel bad or so I think
 we need to be more compassionate you have to like genuinely want understand the other person and you can do some research and you can ask me questions and stuff like that I think I'll just make the whole whole situation like open up in a way that can really change the dynamic and I'm comfortable is when you're probably opens. New information you really want to know more about it and you're not very kind of like their fault somehow or it's not your fault at least they get their display more like whatever it's just not a very productive way of viewing things usually like you want to be compassionate and think about how all the different parties are where they're all coming from no one really thinks they're bad person people think they're good you know if they want to be a good people so if you can think about. From there of you and be like yeah they're not trying to be a dick or a vegetable or whatever
 trying to do what they do is write things how do I understand that I think overall that's going to be really good for everyone there know you like it looking for my specific thing as more like you know you're asking questions. And try to understand their lives just do that try to figure out what their goals are able to communicate and navigate these different scenarios
 write 90 as a decimal point so the last time that we talked we didn't interview with chocolate in the show notes you mentioned that you left high frequency trading because you weren't becoming awesome at making other people more awesome so I can you say that you've made the world more awesome that's the main part that makes me feel good as far as learning a lot about their apps and really a doctor mobile strategies and when they feel like they're kicking ass that makes me feel awesome and they'll like you know them cuz a lot of them are really high profile mobile leaders in the bsp conference with stuff and when they're talking about why they're app is so amazing wins all these are words like has a good stats
 like their slide will have like somewhere on it things that contributes to why they're so like they're doing it on their own I'm crazy Rich that they can execute on their ideas more effectively and that makes me feel good I think that and I think technology that does stuff like that is what can help me move the needle on human Innovation and that's what I said
 how is the sense of engineering at apptimize been different from whatever it since of engineering you had in high frequency trading but it's totally different and I think it's very much about
 optimizing whatever is necessary for your strategy to work and I'll compete the competition in optimize it's about whatever gives our customers the most effective experience so that they can most achieve their goals so far as it's much more about the customers and what they're asking for and what we know is going to make them a lot more performance and productive since a lot more about like it's a service thing customers your bed where is it other than treating it's like competition German
 interesting do you think there's like an in the currency trading space is there less of a thought about the macro implications of the engineering that they're doing or like you know how would you how do high frequency trading Engineers think about the bigger picture like do they make it all about you know yeah I didn't think about it if it was big picture it was thinking about how it be very difficult for someone else to replace what I was doing so I should do it to force them to their game or die cuz like you wanted you wanted under major competition. I forgive you can do something that will force them to have to adjust then you want to do it so that's like as high-level as I would get there
 interesting clothes with a question we haven't card in last time I saw you do you believe that we're living in a simulation I don't know yeah I think so what is the nature of that I don't know so that's why I have a hard time because I'm not sure what we believe in me by simulation I do think that reality is not very cut-and-dry like I have this friend where we have these
 for me amazing conversations I don't know what he feels about him but like he feels like the only thing that is self-evident you know he's like kind of big heart big heart Ian probably yeah I was like oh I can get everything that I perceive that's real and I'm like you know that's not real it is what I'm saying because I mean anything it just a result of everything is going on in your brain from all these chemicals and stuff and it's a loser like you can imagine that all these things happen to you that you kind of remember but really they're not necessarily real like you can have totally fake memory isn't it happens all the time and you just tell yourself these stories about what you think is real but it's really not so I don't think you can even trust your own perceptions at all but I don't know what it what is your theory on the simulation
 yeah I mean I think that were the highest probability is that like it's you know the future somewhere and like we are in somebody else's video games like not attached to any organism would probably like you know autonomous Asians up like it work we're enemies or cohorts in some video game like somebody's simulation somebody's Inception type artificial reality simulation we're just like artificial intelligence instances somewhere because why is everybody in the future is sitting in a vat somewhere and has a simulation somewhere and for each person that has a simulation somewhere there is an autonomous artificial intelligence entities giving them a convincing simulation then that's that's in times the number of people that they're actually are sitting in Vats
 and so if we are either one of the people sitting in fats or one of the artificial autonomous entities probabilistically we would be one of the autonomous artificial entities and the thing is like the future that looks like it's naturally going to germinate in our reality look something like the vet thing I mean you know probably will be old people like when we are old people we're going to be sitting in Hospice Care with an IV drip an Oculus Rift over our eyes with some simulated scenario and chances are like there's going to be a lot of Ultron I don't know this is like totally crazy I think it's like I have a lot of hypotheses but it doesn't taste like anything so I think I just talked about it when I'm totally at Ledger like a diamond
 is it but I can productively do at the moment cuz I don't know we still have to make this reality really awesome I have another hypothesis that we can literally never conceived that it's inconceivable to us what the real reality is like because of the nature of reality our brains could possibly work that it's just not our brains are not able to handle real you better get back to you I'll let you I'll let you go it's been great talking to you as always and thanks for coming onto software engineering daily
 see you later

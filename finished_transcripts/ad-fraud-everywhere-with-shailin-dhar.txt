Transcription: advertising fraud is Easy Legal and extremely profitable a fraudster can set up a website scrape content from the internet and run programmatic advertisements against that website the fraudster can then purchase bought traffic these Bots will visit the page consume advertisements and return profit to the owner of that page in a past life shawland are worked for a company that set up these types of advertising fraud schemes he was fascinated by the industry in the same way that plenty of people including myself yet fascinated with the fast-moving market dynamics that are enabled by modern software what are these people work in adtech or in the financial sector but over time the novelty wore off and shawland realized how big the fraud problem is and how much it is hurting people Stalin works at the door method a company that he found it to do

play this is the simplest form of advertising fraud is creating a website getting add tags from an ad exchange like Google or Apple 6s or any company that has a seat on those exchanges and then purchasing web traffic that loads the page generates add slots and those so those that's locked get sold into the exchanges in real time throughout what we call programmatic advertising so a lot of that traffic that you end up buying is robotic and you only purchase as much as you want and that way if you basically control your cost revenue and profit so just to listen to clear the process is you stand up a WordPress website you throw up some content on the site like let's see you make it you know beef recipes.com or something and then you describe the internet for things about beef recipes
and and then you make a site that looks convincing and then you you insert a little JavaScript blobs that you get from Google or tap Nexus or these other advertising Distributors you put those on the website which causes ads to appear whenever of a consumer visits that website and then whenever consumer visit that website they start to see ads maybe they're targeted about people who you know advertising they want to reach people who are interested in beef and then you buy bought traffic to come to the website quote view Those ads and you make money on the Arbitrage you make money off of those add Impressions that are served to the Bots exactly one small thing is it's not that the advertisers are interested in advertising to people who have an inclination for cooking beef it's that they want to show ads especially retargeting ads
retargeting is kind of the lifeblood of add fraudsters because basically when when you're the actual website you want to get as high as Revenue as possible and the highest rates are paid by advertisers that are trying to complete a sale so if I am shopping for let's say a Gucci purse online and then I exit my shopping cart before completing the purchase I'm going to be retargeted by their campaign and they're going to pay a very high rate because they want to bring me back and complete the sale so is it most of the time have nothing to do with the content so the you would have these Bots and he's Bots might go to you would have the bought like if your program in the bought it would be smart to make that bought go to gucci.com put a Gucci purse in the shopping cart and then like go to the end of the shopping cart process and then drop off and then go visit beef recipes
come so that you get really high at Impressions on that retargeting Gucci purses or just the one example of a kind of high or urgency purchases let's say a flight ticket I go to Emirates I look at First Class tickets to Tokyo and then I leave before making a purchase I'm going to start seeing Emirates ads for flights to Tokyo as soon as I leave the ecosystem is really complex and I think we can boil it down by starting with the sucker in this process the sucker in this process is essentially the company who is paying for the a depression like so the advertiser maybe it's Frito-Lay for Procter & Gamble or Emirates or Gucci or Star Wars movie their motivation is to get a message viewed by a consumer do these advertisers understand how much
of their advertisements are being viewed by Bots no I don't think so not on a mass scale not yet at least so there's two parts that question I think first is how much awareness is there on the advertiser side and second is does anybody know how much is actually being viewed by box and I think both of those are really important question it's because you're wearing a side I think is going to be a gradual process just yeah with education and kind of being willing to admit that things have not been done the smartest way for the past 10 years and I think that's a tough proposition but I think it's happening slowly and I think a lot of the credit goes to advertising trade body so associations that actually represent brand advertisers because they know oh my goodness we are wasting so much money I mean we have to be digital because obviously they're like this don't get me wrong
I ain't no dummy shows an advertising product I don't think advertising is useless or bad and I mean you and I have had conversations around this it's just that it is impossible to audit that is what's so fascinating about this industry is that you have this herd mentality where we're just like spouting numbers and there's numbers aren't really based on anything convincing so the thing with this if you look at who wants actually have these conversations is the constituency of these trade bodies Izzy's Brands and toads actually associations job to make them aware of these things make their make sure they have enough information to do their jobs well otherwise there's no reason to pay their is membership dues that's why be sociation exist in the first place and like you said with him the reason they do advertising the first places be
it works. They wouldn't have spent so much money every single year on Advertising they weren't getting summer turn now where I want to point out the problem is the reason you should take fraud seriously is your spending x amount of money on Advertising based on a return of a certain amount now if you know that 40% of X is going to waste you can be spending 60% continue to spend that 60% and get that same return that justifies that entire budget and if you spent the entire budget more safely in a smarter more calculated way more cautious way you could just be getting more return long-term on your advertising budget which would give you the true value of media that you're buying and not just accept that there's a certain amount being wasted and I'm just going to depend on all these different changes in the ecosystem to tell me how effective
advertising is working what are those steps that you can take so if you say if you know if your Gucci and you say I'm tired of spending so much money on you okay get a higher volume of impressions in the report that gets delivered to me but I know that some of that like a large percentage that is bought traffic what are the steps do you take to clean up your your impressions and how can you measure that like how do you how do you know that you're getting more clean Impressions so there's there's no on paper just way to say okay you know I'm going to implement this one process and now I'm going to get cleaner impressions are at that I'm going to know that my impressions are cleaner off the bat part of it has to just do with auditing your supply chain so you know if your friend Advertiser you go to your agency and you say hey what are you guys doing about fraud and a lot of times the only answer that you'll get is we have a verification solution where we
pixel across the campaign and we're measuring quality the traffic that way that has become problematic as a sole solution because there's traffic available to websites that is designed this robotic traffic is designed to pass the major filters used by the advertising industry is not going to be a solution on itself second part of this Supply on it is your email for these digital media buys your agency's going to be using a demand-side platform or a trade desk so within that DSP or trade desk environment core all their supply Partners so there's again there's now tons of AD networks on the other side there supply-side platforms and then there are no just kind of what are these pools of inventory in these lips called private marketplaces and the major at exchanges so you all these different layers of Supply coming into the funnel of a trade
Ford ESP campaign from the advertising cider being executed through that funnel so it's important for the advertiser to audit the agency the agency to audit the PSP PSP to continually audit all their supply partner because fraud is not a moral problem it's not like no dates I think the industry gets to fixed on the morality of it and you know the technical aspects of it rather than looking at okay it's a just it's a purely Financial motive and also that it's a problem with the supply chain of advertising. That's how this traffic is coming through it's not that the traffic just appearing on The Advertiser side these fraudsters the people creating this traffic the people buying this traffic purchasing it and using it to exploit the way that campaigns are executed on The Advertiser side so like we talked about retargeting they know that they're going to get the most money from
looking like purchasing tenders so that's how they fear their boss today when I'm choosing the tools for my side projects the first thing that I look for is ease-of-use that's why I love mongodb it is the most popular non-relational database and it is super easy to use at the beginning of a project I often don't know the shape of my objects and Mongo makes it easy to evolve the database schema as I like overtime overtime as my project gets popular I'm going to need to scale and thankfully mongodb has built-in horizontal scalability but configuration and database maintenance aren't really what I want to spend my time on thankfully mongodb Atlas was released in 2016 mongodb Atlas is the easiest way to get access to mongodb without having to run the database you're
you pay only for what you use for small projects all the way up to large production deployments to try mongodb Atlas today go to mongodb. Com a C daily and get a free $25 in credit use promo code go Atlas 25 to get that $25 in free credit that was the only hosted mongodb service built by the engineers behind the database the company mongodb with Atlas you get into end encryption you get VPC peering to get access to the latest releases and for a limited time you can go to mongodb. Com SE daily enter promo code go Atlas 25 and get that $25 in credit and get started with mongodb Atlas thanks to mongodb for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily and thanks for being the database behind a lot of my favorite side projects in the past we're really happy to have mongodb as a new sponsor
Shopper engineering daily
 you mentioned this verification stuff so I did a show with verification company I was a little skeptical of their techniques and the technique is like we've got this way of we use Biometrics and we we track we know we we build a model for what is a human and what is a bot and listeners can listen back to that episode didn't like what you told me on the phone a while ago was that these models for verification the base of the way verification company works is you know add traffic goes to beef recipes.com before at impressions are served you have a you have a call out to this
 verification company that says hey is this person that just landed on beef recipes. Com a real person so you would have a pixel that gets processed 1st East and makes called are you human too hey can you check if this person looks like a human and but what you told me I was like this this is this is basic is subjective model that they've developed and yeah it's I mean it's based on some things that look kind of objectively like what human is or or human is not but in my conversation with are you human I was just unconvinced that these things cannot be easily spooked by somebody who wants to spoof it and and and you know one of the counter argument was you know yeah maybe they could do that but they're not doing and I was like okay so where's your proof of that say they're not doing it you know they're going to do what they're going to do stuff like uber fraud or payment system fraud or something that's higher return and it was like
 noad fraud is massive returns and nobody's going after it and it's been around like it's been you can if you've been able to exploit this for like a decade nobody's going after the decade it's like a really safe thing to invest in as a fraudster am I mistaken about anything that I just said they have every incentive to do so and so there's two things I want to point out with these incentives on the front side is first in that basic cat-and-mouse scenario of you know a lot detector versus a box Creator the bot detector is operating as a legitimate business they have employees that have no work hours they go home at the end of the day and I don't want to be overly assuming but generally they are paid a fixed salary just to give you like a very Hands-On scenario that's the situation for about that
 and if you look at the BOK Creator they are what we call black hats they have no set work hours and they are directly compensated for how effective and how scalable there bots are they are there more incentivize financially and with their time to make sure that there bots are bypassing these filters now you can get into a debate on who's more skilled you have enough white hats that kind of counterbalance the skill levels but you look at time and money incentives there much heavier on the Creator side so it's not the incentives aren't there a second is Young with the incentives what are the consequences and so far add fraud does not break any laws and be overwhelming majority of the time across the world and it's just starting to change slowly it doesn't even violate contracts most contracts and advertising don't have closets for in Dollar Tree
 so there's not even civil consequences there that's in that is what is so crazy to me is because you might say you know if you're going to be sketchy fraudster and you're going to take advantage of markets why wouldn't you just go to Wall Street and it's like no no it's actually much easier and you were telling me some of the returns that you were seeing as a black hat not like that is it was astounded at how much money you can make as just the the the the the entrepreneur running beef recipes.com nice to know right I'm so skeptical at this point that if somebody has a like what I mean no offense to anybody that has a recipe Network bit let's say somebody has a Network recipe sites and the other claiming to have 30 million visitors a month I'm very skeptical until I can see
 CV axle traffic reports and the sources and the young growth and there should be fluctuations now and a lot of times when I do audits for clients and I see just like continual growth lack of punctuation is actually a sign that something is wrong because if you look at my budget is spent they usually reset somewhere in January or February so from February let's say all the way through December they're just growing at budgets are being spent at a higher rate in the higher rate at a high rate and then you get to October November December which we refer to as Q4 just that's what it's so much of that holiday spending is done by consumers which means you're going to promote lots of products to them during that time spent at the highest rate if you somebody if somebody website starts at very low traffic in February and just continues to grow at High
 volume higher volume higher volume higher volumes all the way through December and then resets the next year again at February that is a big big red flag because that basically tells you that they're buying traffic to keep up with growing because it's so why would I buy traffic that I don't need is pure Arbitrage what is the role of Google and Facebook in this ecosystem are the biggest players in the ecosystem at least for the time being so now if you go with the assumption that I go with the witches that fraud is everywhere they probably benefit the most from its existence is financially they obviously do care about quality Google now has taken step I'm not going to say that they're doing everything they can
 I'm definitely not convinced of that because if Google and Facebook went out of their way to get rid of all the fraud I'm sure there will be a lot more done but maybe that just hasn't been much of a concern to them Google obviously does just kick off so bad Supply Partners if there's Clayton fraud detected they will just kick them off and basically they strong arm these fraudsters to basically just say we're just going to shut off your receivables so even if you three months of receivables that's a half a million dollars go to shut it off and nobody is going to be stupid enough to take Google to court over that I mean go bankrupt you just trying to get a hearing with Facebook you see that it's not that they shown any hesitation to rent their Network across because in 2014 they made an acquisition the company called live rail which was a video at
 work and then for me and other people that were on this black outside we knew live rail as the place to sell garbage video traffic now that's where you could sell garbage traffic for video ads CPM switch we're in Norma's y'all talking 10-15 $20 per thousand Impressions and then they bought it and we were like oh my God they're buying that how much 5 million 10 million and we were blown away when it was four hundred million dollars said okay no maybe they're going to turn around and maybe they obviously don't know what's in there been in early 2016 they just shut it down I mean it became apparent to them internally bit this is right with Broad and they can shut it down I mean there was no hesitation like some press release of okay we're going to try to turn around 400 million dollar acquisition just shut it
 we need to implement some fix it just shows me the lack of understanding in the first place if they even made the acquisition so that's where I have the skepticism of how much they could be doing internally to even come out the problem when you're able to make a 400 million dollar acquisition of a network that was known across the industry with if you ask the right people that this is not a good purchase but according to normal advertising metrics it passed all the checks number of Impressions number of Publishers average CPM fill rate from the average yearly pass all those basic checks but what you're doing quality control with the assumption that ad for autism it's out there then you would have entirely different checks and I don't think that was an argument in Google and Facebook's favor is that you go on Gmail and you still get spam I mean you know
 less and less over time but you still get some spam and
 Gmail is a very simple well-formed interface experience steam ale and mostly text the open internet is a much richer more complex experience you could say the same thing about a social network and so I think an argument in Google and Facebook's favor is if you can't completely prevent spam in Suffolk is narrow is Gmail where Google incentives are much more in the direction of we want to prevent spam as much as possible in an email environment you know it kind of is a strong counter argument against like Google and Facebook being nefarious proper hoarding fraudsters themselves right like is is that safe to say I think in our conversations about the sounds like you wish there was more publicity about from Google and Facebook about this evening would that be
 yeah I don't think Google should shy away from sharing what they're doing about fraud also is on so many websites Google's advertising tags run so many websites and for smaller advertisers let's say you know a dry cleaning store score front or let's say a nail specialty butcher shop those small advertisers if they're not going to come to a digital Ad Agency and then come up with a programmatic retargeting campaign at this thing majority of them go to Google because it's the most accessible and it's also the most you know it's the most trusted name that they know of its okay I already have a Gmail account and you know I just log in with my Gmail idea created you know AdWords campaign or you know if I'm a bigger Advertiser I use
 Jacksonville just put in my ads and you pick what type of websites in Sudbury seamless but if they know if those small advertisers not made aware of okay hey how you do quality checks and this is how you make sure that you're reaching the right people I mean let me take that back they do help them Reach the right people but smaller advertisers are not made aware of the levels of fraud if you take the Assumption let's say a conservative estimate of 25% of traffic is fraudulent in some way the majority of advertisers are now this meal conglomerate of small local businesses so I'm a lawyer or I may be an accountant or I am a health insurance broker or I am a butcher shop rhyme a dry cleaner in there so many of these campaigns in there all over the world because I mean Google if you going to go
 campaign portal you can like draw a line on Google Maps around city blocks for who you want to Target and it's very localized this is not new Gucci is not going in and saying K well I want advertised this city block of San Francisco that's good that's geared towards local advertisement bearing the brunt of it as you're saying make up more of the net add purchasing traffic then then giant Brands like Gucci your partner I cancel really I would love for somebody to correct me on that okay as far as I know and you hear you hear a defense of fraud is priced into the system but that's probably just probably not true because you know if you know if what you said is correct
 we don't know that for sure whether or not it's correct you know even Frito-Lay in Procter & Gamble aren't pricing in fraud they don't know fraud exists there's information asymmetry they do have people that lets say in the next two years whose job it is to inform them of that their agencies were their marketing teams that will come back to them that same information is not going to be as accessible to a small Advertiser where are the fees at exchanges that we haven't really talked a lot about it and talk about the middle layers
 open MX app Nexus these are huge businesses that most people haven't ever heard of what purpose do they serve they serve a purpose to connect add suppliers which are websites with ADD spaces with advertisers who want to Target the users visiting those sites and basically Bay process transactions basically execute what we call RTD real-time bidding which is a hundred 250 millisecond second price auction meaning that the height of highest bidder wins and they pay the price at the second highest bidder was willing to pay the other set of players is these dsps ssps providers supply-side providers the ship between the publisher in the advertiser
 explain explain these layers also explain how these interact with the exchanges to sew the DSP sits on the buy side of the exchange so the demand-side platform as state executes the advertising demand and then the supply-side platforms sit on the south side of the exchange which is the websites so you basically just looking at multiple layers because the agent be exchanged is processing it's holding the auctions and it's processing the transaction and then it's actually taking the creative nail file with the weather it's an image or video and placing it on to the ads lot coming from the supply side thing is publisher Publishers are aggregated into the supply-side platforms so no one supply-side platform represents let's say yo just for example a thousand different websites and then there's 10 supply-side
 platforms that plug into the exchange that I have yo 10,000 sites coming into the exchange and then the dsp's are executing campaigns for let's say no 10 advertisers each lots of different campaigns but let's say 10 hour Tizer advertisers who have 10,000 different sites available tonight and that's the purpose of the exchange so the dsp's aggregate demand ssp's aggregate supply it sounds like this is this is a a good economic sister makes am I mean that makes economic sense to me is exactly like this it seems like that's that's pretty efficient I think it is efficient problem is there still a curfew
 changes that need to be made in the incentive structures to incentivize quality on all sides so what I mean by that is most of these what I refer to as adtech layers so they're not doing the creative work they're not doing this strategy necessarily their focused on executing the media by or executing the selling of this ad space they charge either a girl or a boy by side fee and then they make money on ad serving so per impression transacted they make a small fee so the problem with that is that whether these add spaces are $10 cpm's no $10 for a thousand add slots or whether it's $0.10 per thousand which is very low quality they're making the same money so they're not incentive eyes necessarily towards quality
 right now and if you have many many more of the $0.10 CPM Impressions to fill those add budgets you're going to see a lot more volume which means you're going to make more at serving fees and I think that's where some changes need to be made across the industry your job as sketchy sketchy artist whatever you want to call it you know black black hat adtec look at I think you know what I was talking to you about it you know you were you were fascinated by the industry I mean it's like the same it's the same reason I went into your way first job out of school I went into like I ditch options trading place and then I was like you know there is a chance that there is sketching this that I'm going to see like at the company that I didn't by the way I didn't see anything sketchy there
 I was just so fascinated you know there's something so interesting about markets and highly automated markets in when you get into the advertising game you realize how much of it is just like Wall Street so you started this company called the door method and what you explain to me is your kind of a consultant you basically go to these advertising conferences and make advertisers feel really sad what are you trying to do with the DAR method my goal is to educate all pieces of the advertising ecosystem on the logistics of brought the problem right now is you don't have opportunities for people that are spending money on Advertising to learn very clearly what the dangers are in terms of fraught and basically don't like my tagline is advertising should be effective accountable and understood
 sure you can come up with the greatest targeting strategy and execution plan and media media by plan but if you're just you know 40% that money go to waste you don't necessarily even know how effective your advertising is Yom you could have come up with the greatest campaign that if you were only buying human traffic would have won some advertising award because your supply chain is not clean you're never going to understand how effective your campaign was actually going to be so hungover Kaiser's an opportunity to understand that young knowing that I can provide first-hand knowledge of how it's done and also don't believe everything you read there's a lot of companies under investigation will working on right now so I can't leave the company yet but I would love to give it to you and your listeners at a later point but there's this company that sells
 waiting fraudulent traffic that is designed to pass major filters for sub Penny clip prices on talking about six tenths of a cent per click three tenths of a cent per click depending on the filter that you owe now is providing advertising click advertising to the US government so this like whole lack of awareness and sure we can written about this is that people can justify you don't like in our deep subconscious we're just like you even if you work in the agency like will these big Brands like Kraft or no Pepsi by bake have so much money do you know what's a little waist and spending the money are some digital marketing person right lower down there but she talking about those local advertisers know she don't actually fix the actual supply chain of the way I ever tizing is executed to be small
 going to continue to get screwed by young just inherent problems and the system and they're not even going to know and it's like I think that's where the problem lies more than just you know trying to fix things for big Brands because if you fix the system it's going to be better for the small businesses are somewhat receptive is that accurate yeah I make this joke that know when I give a speech or presentation I know I did a good job at everybody looks frustrated and depressed at the end because I'm not delivering good news but no part of my point is at now you understand what to look for and so your perspective on approaching the problem is going to be entirely different you're going to ask the smarter questions better questions you're going to demand better answers to those questions because if you didn't really understand how fraud Works who is doing it like I provide
 I'm very Hands-On examples I show my own report that I've done where I created a fake site earlier this year got it approved on an ad platform sold as into it and I showed that I was buying all this one tenth of a cent per click Datacenter traffic then you understand okay well I can ask better questions because of agency let's say on behalf of their clients technology Partners okay what are you doing about fraud if you didn't know enough about fraud that you can be given any answer and you have to accept it and let it let's be clear your example the hilarious part of it is you're buying Data Center Traffic which should be really really easy to identify you know it's like coming from from a virtualized server on Amazon somewhere human traffic doesn't look like that there's one question of whether it's detectable or not you know how sophisticated the creators of the traffic are
 and that the degree of which that played into it is debatable the second issue there is yo I've Heard lots of justification for allowing data center traffic I can't speak on this authoritatively but what I get told as a justification is there's lots of corporate setups where they use data center proxies for all of their employees and no appetizer shouldn't be shut off from showing ads to people who are at work from 9 to 5 or 9 to 6 everyday just because they're accessing the internet through data center connection

 what are the attic companies say like when you happy cuz you say you're trying to change the whole industry what are the what it was a response to the ad tech companies I hope that's that's that's the grander goal that accompanies young really depends and it really depends on the people at the top of these companies and how proactive they want to be there's plenty companies that have taken public stance against fraud and yet they have taken steps just too kind of boot off bad players the problem with that is you know it's cutting out she made it sound like they're banned for life day they lose their account will find another account they'll go under somebody else's got some still find a way around at the company's I recently was very surprised I never expected a supply-side platform to reach out to me but I did work with a spy platform and
 it was amazing how receptive they were how much initiative they're taken internally to kind of promote quality as a differentiated between them and their competitors even though they know that in the short-term it's not going to be beneficial there lifeblood is to have as much advertising inventory available as possible for buyers but they're willing to compromise on the short-term ready for the long-term goal of camping known for their quality which is only going to bring in more buyers and those buyers are going to pay higher premium rates to be able to buy a network so I think it's shifting slowly because again I think it just depends on who's running the company and whether they're exposed to the right information are they made aware of what this problem is and how it's affecting the entire Market I can get shipping slowly who are in denial or disbelief in there like your conspiracy theorist you have no data to vacuum
 I've been called I've been called an idiot called a fear Monger I've been called a liar you know because I talk a lot about these financial and I've been called out and it's very fair for them to say yeah well you're trying to make the problem seem bigger than it is because you want clients to hire you and then like yeah sure but I'll just put my research and all night you know reports out there it's not that I'm like you don't hear by a 599 subscription to access my pants just out there like the education is free now if you want now I'm not trying to make a plug for my consultant now if you want like Hands-On Audits and yell process Improvement no such thing then that's where my business wise but in the education if I'm hiding information from people then what's the point of doing now anything that I'm doing
 data can be sent me you hear these absurd numbers like 70% of advertising is seen by boss or 80% to see if I bought some 50% see if I bought those numbers don't come from anywhere reliable and yet that's not it would be like fake news articles that are going around now people hello how did this fake news get so big because we are kind of wire to believe what we're told we like have some type of inherent trust that if somebody saying it like why would they lie and with this it's not that they're even trying to lie it's that they took one sample of traffic let's save even statistically big enough to be quantitatively representative of the entire market then they used one detection method of single detection methods there's lots of detection methods on how to define abs
 are human beings want to text a message to say this is the rate of Baht traffic in this sample and then they extrapolated that to the entire market right in that is like Mark Zuckerberg saying it's crazy to believe that Facebook fake the fake news on Facebook impacted the elections like wow okay if it's so crazy then why don't you show us your audit methods and there are many I can see what I mean there was never a problem until now it was never considered a problem until now I'm sure they have some internal scrutiny I'm sure they have done some stuff where they're still interest interest baction into you know how much fake news they think they're systematic process though I don't think it's no I think there's from the reports that have come out and you know what I know at Facebook is that there were teams that were doing these things but it wasn't part
 the corporate structure and behavior just like constantly remove these things and the fact that he that he was willing to say it's crazy to believe that this had a significant impact I think is is indicative of how far it's cuz it's like I mean to me seems easier to police then then advertising fraud is a lot more little players that seem semi trustworthy in the advertising business and there are in the news business like the news it is a smaller subset of black reliable news outlets and and yet Zuckerberg statement on fake news was so tone-deaf to reality it's yeah I mean you got to give the guy a little bit of slack he's the CEO and naturally CEOs are little bit disconnected from what's happening on
 grout he's a part of his dad gets taken up by yo what's going on with WhatsApp in the Indian market you know how we going to grow that how do we collect me an update are we organize and the data properly but you have to have to just like give him that little bit of credit cutting down a 400 million dollar video at work that they found to be fraudulent person that didn't roll their eyes in the long run you could see the advantages of Facebook being somewhat of a walled-garden to with with you know with the with single account policy for individuals in terms of getting highly reliable
 advertising I do think that the other shoe is going to drop eventually on this fraud stuff right now we're kind of in the I'd like to draw the parallel between the 2008 mortgage crisis where you know you had this institutional herd mentality for like 6 years or 7 years or something where it's you know we all we had these supposedly uncorrelated mortgage back Securities and they all turn out to be worthless because they were actually correlated in today media buyers you know that they're purchasing all this traffic and they're willing to say all 50% of our advertising spend is wasted we just don't know what 50% they love saying that maybe they're wasting closer to 80 90 99% of their ad budget and only wasting time and you're the person that's wasting 80
 70% why doesn't the does the pressure port in this I remember we we we talked a little bit at lunch while ago about like oppressed potentially getting involved in this why does my pressure port on this very much and get some very misunderstood problem you know it's and this is the problem and I sympathize with specifically the advertising trade press because it's not that people just lay a ton of information down at their feet and are like here please we like to be open and upfront with you you know here can you honestly report on problems with the industry does not happen they kind of have to scrounge for tidbits of reliable information from Professionals in the industry and then put together these reports and articles for the rest of the industry that kind of tape yeah well as gospel which is scary sometimes because I have people that will argue with me that I read this article that said this and I'm like well
 okay but you read an article and again no offense to anybody in the trade press have a lot of respect for them but they are journalists they are not add fraud specialist so they are giving you the best representation of what they understand and you have to take it as that you can't take it at now this is a expert report written by a specialist this is a journalist giving you the best representation of the information on a very misunderstood and invasive topic and that's how I think people should look at what they read do you think there is any suppression is go on Google and Facebook suppressing like I mean are there actually people writing about this and it just gets depressed there are reports that have been suppressed academic reports that have been suppressed and they all can't publicly go into detail and disclose exactly happened but that has happened in
 scary that way and I don't think it's the heads of the company that made those decisions it's some mid to senior-level director that heard that that was out squashed it because they felt that was their Duty and that that is very scary to me the suppression of information because it's not in people's Financial interests related it to the 2008 crash in a lot of that companies going public and if you look at the trends so far with these at companies it has not been promising but you seem more and more that are going public and you can't miss her even blame the CEO or the directors because there's DC's that pumped tens of millions of dollars
 into those companies they want their return they are not going to be loyal well you know I guess I'll just wait for my pay out because I want the industry to have yo higher quality standards before we open up these shares to the public that's just not how they think their financial institution for trying to get their money back around the spot traffic that ultimately is reviewing these ads is at the bar traffic is coming from China or Russia or it's organized crime where is it coming for a visit coming from miscreant teenagers is it coming from a programmer in a college dorm who is the stars above all of the above yes that's the most comprehensive yeah we have this don't really get it but like you know when there's obviously things with Putin and suppression of freedom of press and speech and Russia but we have this like some weird inherent thing that like
 we just started blaming Russia off-the-cuff as being the source for this problem and I just don't get it I mean it's like it's like it's like the most easily acceptable answer for some reason and people just because your actions are good. I only done by hackers and that's just not the case and you'll part of what I tried to Boyz to Men actually dig into these fraudulent ad networks there's a stay-at-home dad with 3 kids who's a fantastic husband and a fantastic father and just a great guy and he loves to rock climb and go to the gym and he runs bras on that Network
 resources spots by Distributing malware and she runs across one at that work and he's not sitting in the basement he's got a nice home office to pay you the picture like this person actually exist works with his buyers are legitimate companies that continue to buy from him because he creates high quality High Revenue generating traffic to hacker problem was in that so that's like it was an interesting byproduct of the SSP DSP layers of abstraction between the Publishers and advertisers is your you get you get removed the accountability gets subtracted
 okay so let's let's close off plenty of interesting stuff we've talked about play more we could have covered what is the biggest changes that you're seeing in this industry in the advertising industry like what's coming up on the horizon I think agencies are going to get a heavy metaphorical kick in the teeth because I did a lot of these like transparency reports coming out and there's been a lot of seeds of Doubt planted into the major people who don't know I'm Gucci I go to an agency and I say hey by me you know a hundred thousand dollars worth of the cyber cyber advertising and agency does something
 brat and that something is a waste of money many times so basically agencies are hired as Specialists to do the planning and execution of advertising so they are basically compensated for knowing the market and also having creative people like a team of creatives on staff that make a can of Pepsi look extremely refreshing and a 300 by 250 pixel video add on my phone that's what they're paid for the problem and what advertisers are waking up to is that agencies are not incentivize financially to act in their best interest they're paid on a margin basis so agencies are given if I say to an agency I want to spend a million dollars on Advertising I'm also going to pay a 10% fee on that a margin fee to the agency for the
 execution by pay them a hundred grand to execute that media by problem right now is given the situation in the Seas have never had a incentive financially to spend less on behalf of their Advertiser clients because if they spend less fat percentage drops but he on that 10% went from 100000 to 80000 now they make 20000 West and kill black they can move to a smaller office they're going to fire employees like that snare that's why you see so many hiring and firing sprees at a dnc's because it's so volatile that way the problem is that advertisers need to realize that you need to compensate people fairly to do their jobs and this goes all the way down and this is what I think is going to change in the next year or two is you're going to see contract and compensation structures change to get incentives in line with quality because what happens when the agency makes less money they negotiate lower rate
 with the actual media suppliers and when media suppliers are paid lower rates they have to make up the money somewhere they have an incentive to buy traffic and show volume gets bigger low rates get lower and everybody has to basically make their bottom line they have shareholders they have investors they have employees and everybody's being squeezed from the top down and I think that's going to change over the next couple years alright so winter is coming Shaolin a really I really like like what you're doing and I feel free to come back on the show if you got some I would be happy to have some interesting updates for you guys and the awesome

Transcription: Michael Miller is the author of The Ultimate Guide to bitcoin Michael welcome to software engineering daily hi Jeff could be here with you perfect guess because many of the people listening are software Engineers who understand things like public key cryptography and hashing but they may not be familiar with Bitcoin other than what they have heard in passing and your book was written to explain the technology to anybody to start off what is bitcoin or Bitcoin is some people call it a cryptocurrency your virtual currency it is definitely not a traditional currency but it's a way to exchange value essentially digitally and virtually anonymously from one person to another person from one organization to another organization
I don't want to emphasize to the listeners right now if you're thinking okay Bitcoin is useful just because it allows me to electronically transfer funds like PayPal or Apple pay you're missing the point the Breakthrough functionality Bitcoin provides is decentralisation what is decentralisation and why is it useful what what does mean in traditional currency such as the US dollar or the Euro or you don't take your pick the currency is controlled by a central central government or Central organization is Central Bank and are they they decide how much money is out there and how much money isn't out there and then what happens to their money and and to a certain degree decide how much their money's worth and threw that we've got various official means of exchanging that date I mean we use credit card companies we use PayPal card to send money back and forth and we just hand people dollar bills to from time to time
with a crypto currency like Bitcoin there is no Central governing organization there is no apparatus I mean there is no one group of people that controls you know what happens with Bitcoin there is no Bitcoin help desk there is no Bitcoin tech support there is no no none of this is all kind of out there in the cloud and the advantage of that took some people one is what you get away from that kind of control you don't have the government control so if you're you're you're big on not having government control record of currency like Bitcoin makes a lot of sense I mean you're not dealing with government it also I have it as a huge amount of anonymity because we're not going through big companies and Banks and credit card companies and end the government keeping track of this that we can exchange funds without anybody knowing it and that has advantages for a lot of different things both the legal and illegal for that matter it also because it is not
tied to any national currency it's a it's a decent weight for four countries or or or people who have currency issues I mean if you got some developing third world countries that really their own currency isn't worth it worth a damn you know but they they can exchange money in and be tied into something larger and have that actually be more stable than what they're used to doing so there a lot of advantages to buy anything by any organization or government it I mean it's kind of the Wild Wild West out there in terms of Bitcoin we don't have a national you know Securities and Exchange Commission that this regulating the stuff for an FDIC that's guaranteeing Investments I mean you can lose your Bitcoin and you lose your Bitcoin do you deal with the Bitcoin exchange that goes under or gets hacked
and you're just at luck there's no back up to it whatsoever could you define the term fiat currency well fiat currency in traditional currencies you really have two types of today we really only have one type in the old old days a currency was backed by a commodity I mean people might know the term the gold standard remember the gold standard where you know that the price of the dollar was essentially back by the US gold reserves are countries gold reserves will a fiat currency is still run by a larger in to be like a government but it is not backed by any commodity so today you know the US government and print as much money as they want to prevent because it's not tied to a commodity but it is your back up by the US government I mean you not going to say oh US government that that's no good no no it is it is backed by the government just as a euro is back about buying other European organization
it's not backed up by any you know the block of gold over here anything like it used to be in the old days we went off the gold standard back in the seventies I think under Nixon bedtime to the value of a fiat currency seems to be the fact that you'd have an institution that's providing support it's like the value of of your Windows operating system is the fact that Microsoft you know will support it Microsoft will continue to have updates to it since I'm sent so when you think about Fiat currencies like US dollars or pesos what are some ways in which intermediaries can take advantage of their power over Fiat currencies
well I mean if we if we looked last night so you a system in the government can control you know the rate of inflation per say bye bye how much currency we have out there if we've got a Slowdown in the economy they can just print more money and it's backed up by the time it doesn't back up again by anything hard you know in gold or diamonds or what not but it is backed up by the United States government the government says it's worth this much and it's worth that much because of Fiat currencies like that obviously then that money is exchanged by all sorts of entities an organization's banks of the stock exchange PayPal credit card companies are all used to dealing with that that money because it is backed up by the United States government they know it's not going to go away tomorrow now that might be different if you're in Greece me Greece has a fear of Graces using the you are right now but you know me I'll suddenly drop the year old we know which which is always been a possibility recently
and they went back to the drachma or what what are their currency is it may be back by the Greek government but it may not be working with major governmental Powers how do banks exploit their role in the fiat currency system off of every transaction for one you know every little thing you do at your bank or at anybody does at a bank is charged so you know they might be making half a penny here half penny there whatever but it all adds up they also get the store the money you know when you deposit the money it just is setting in
they don't have dollar bill sitting in their Banks anymore but the the digital equivalent that it is setting in their digital equivalent of a vault and their earning money while on your money while they're storing your money so you know it's a it's a matter of having a middleman there and the middle man being able to make money just by handling things and handle things back and forth and also they could borrow against it in the things that they could potentially in danger the money that you have in that institution although it's is fdic-insured and of course we still have the the issue of too-big-to-fail so yeah so they can take her money and do anything they want with it and gamble it away I wish essentially they've been doing the past decades or so and because of the bank size because of those institutions size nothing's going to bad going to happen to them because I might be bad happening to us mind to unfortunately there you know that their major Powers there
feather kind of protective just because of their size and their influence centralization is dangerous you have to have money in these banks these banks are inherently problematic so but now explain why we do need back so and I think the most iconic way to explain this is the double spending problem we have this thing called the double spending problem where if you know what this classic problem and in cryptocurrencies in the past where if you have you have a dollar in in your cryptocurrency you can essentially spend that dollar twice right you give it to you give it to Betsy and you give it to Alice and and you've said you've made two transactions in The Ledger to these two different people but because you don't have a central institution to verify that that you know of these transactions are both valid you know this is problematic
got this thing called called the double spending problem because it with virtual currency it isn't back by anything is not in the bank is not in some huge Ledger net again this is before Bitcoin so it basically it depends on your word right you say you have this virtual currency so you're going as you said your going to get some of it the best seeing some of it to the Bob over here and that there's nothing really to check on that what Bitcoin did and was one of several rich I mean they're actually hundreds of cryptocurrencies out there now all operating with similar technology but Bitcoin was really the first to popularize it is to use something called a blockchain and you mentioned before blockchain is really the key thing behind us at the real important thing behind Bitcoin and what a black Sheen does it is essential herbs it is a master Ledger of every single Bitcoin transaction out there
. and it is store it is decentralized out there on the cloud it's on multiple computers or multiple users computers a copy of the blockchain is so you can't you know if you're going in Hackett on one computer still exist on a thousand other computer so so that that's kind of a safety thing there it's almost done Hackle because the encryption that uses but basically the way it works is when you make a Bitcoin transaction
 hey you one Bitcoin for the services that you rendered to me alright that is that transaction gets entered into the blockchain essentially it's a new Block in a chain of blocks and an incense that registers every single Bitcoin transaction is register you can't double spend something because it's there and it's out the ball the participants are private the transaction is public so that transaction is out there everyone sees it is that there are multiple computers you can't hack into it if you try and duplicate that transaction or spend that Bitcoin again you can't because it's just out there and it's in the blockchain I mean if you envision it as a series of boxes I say you know one connected to another like in a diagram or something I mean it's long I mean it's thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of transactions long and growing everyday because every new transaction that's done is a new block and it's a blockchain out there in the public so you can
 steal it you can't double spend that you can't do anything like that it's just their engineering stuff so we've articulated why centralization is dangerous we've articulated why we needed in the past and we've articulated why Bitcoin and blockchain allows us to not need centralization anymore at least in some context is there any usage for centralization post Bitcoin post blockchain like what is what essential ization still useful for beyond beyond its classical classical now deprecated ideas well I wouldn't say that it's deprecated mean there is Value Inn in a lot of different approaches and certainly to the average consumer there is value to centralization in that it lends support Security in
 Prince even Peace of Mind / say if you want to think of it that way again the problem with Bitcoin the problem I mean I would not recommend that my my aunt goes out and gets into Bitcoin ticker for example because for number different reasons but one of which is because it really isn't secure it isn't backed by anything that I mean when something goes wrong it goes wrong you know someone steals your Bitcoin wallet or hacks into a Bitcoin exchange your you're just out you know they're there is nothing backing it up and I think that's an issue to 226 function as a stable currency which I don't think that Quinn is doing today for a number of reasons but the function of the Staples currency I think it needs Security in addition to stability stability is the other issue on it right now I mean right now the price is up and down and up and down and up and down up and down on bitcoin which you know it's fine for a a meter
 I was speculation but it's not really if you know what currency you spend everyday you don't want to be worth one thing today or something else completely different tomorrow so you know Bitcoin is still kind of I look at it as almost a proof-of-concept you know it is built on a Technologies the first currency built on technology which is fascinating but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to replace the dollar tomorrow what about what about government like it could could we use the blockchain technology to replace a lot of the functionalities that we currently we currently vote how did government change with blockchain technology is a lot of different entities are looking at blockchain technology I know that the world is looking at it for example as a way to authenticate pieces of art I in transactions there so you know that you talk about your double spending thing we'll talk about pieces of art where you got forgery
 going on out there and transactions that are off the books and that sort of thing well if every transaction got I'll put into the blockchain you not going to have to worry about forgery and that's her thing you're going to know where the real transactions are the world of music is looking into it as a means of compensating artist for their music being played in a right now you got to the music industry is a mess has been a mess Forevers more of a mess today than ever Club here and it gets played on the radio here and it gets played on this internet station in the screening service and keeping track of it it is horrible and there's always somebody in the middle you know getting there 50% also and it's never a small percentage so it's about 50% music industry well if all of these music transactions got entered into a blockchain the we can get your payments directly to musicians without middleman and and it's go
 attract whole lot better I was reading an article today where NASDAQ exactly looking at incorporating the blockchain as a means of managing and verifying their transactions so that technology can be used in a lot of different ways without being Standalone thing like Bitcoin mes is a very interesting concept really behind whole thing on how we keep track of stuff in it really is in a way kind of a crowdsourced thing because it really does depend on the participation of a lot of different users and their computers to handle the encryption and handle the storage and the decentralized the storage on it so by decentralizing it that way it almost makes it more secure so now that we have some contacts around the Practical applications of Bitcoin of the blockchain let's talk about some of the engineering and like we should the real Innovation is not Bitcoin
 but rather the blockchain Bitcoin is is like email and the blockchain is like the whole internet and what I mean by that is Bitcoin is certainly cool it's only an innovation just like email but you can email to send like a messages with text which is great but you know what the internet you could do all kinds of things you can get on Facebook you can use Google Docs you can do VoIP there's so much more functionality and with the blockchain the idea of decentralisation is much more generalized so now it's a little more fine-grained engineering detail what is the blockchain
 well like I said it really is a general ledger of of transactions when you go to exchange a Bitcoin buy a Bitcoin sell a Bitcoin pay someone or what not use involves public key encryption so you send your public key to the other person the other person sends his public key to you and that message goes out to F1 of a better word was called the Bitcoin Network alright and this is just a series of computers only by individuals that have agreed to participate in these transactions and and what happens is that transaction which is encrypted has to be verified and to be verified a computer has to run a series of mathematical calculations on it without getting to type more technical than I even understand that but it's real heavy duty Brute Force Computing sore thing where
 very heavy duty mining computer has 2 Neo solve these calculations and the first and it matter fact multiple computers will go in and essentially bid on these things and try and saw the calculations the first computer that that solves the calculation to things happen one transaction is verified and is added to the blockchain second that the computer that sold that calculation but essentially verified that transaction is awarded a certain number Bitcoins as compensation as cold Bitcoin mining in this is how one new Bitcoins are created and and how people in individuals organizations are in scented to participate in the whole Bitcoin Network and verify the transactions that sort of thing once a transaction has been verified it is that it is blockchain that copy the blockchain is then propagated across the entire network so let me know of any given time you know this computer that
 the other computer might have slightly different versions of the blockchain you know depending on what new transactions have been upended or not but you know within a very short period of time all those all those versions come into congruence and we got any of the same version now propagated across the entire network and then because it is propagated on so many different computers I mean that that's your security right there
 and so that was a great experience just to put a finer point on that could you give a definition of a distributed Ledger
 distributed Ledger is essentially the blockchain that that ledger is distributed across the entire network
 great and more broadly how does a peer-to-peer Network function of which this is kind of a peer-to-peer Network and as were used to in the old days with Napster and and and whatnot today is essentially multiple computers connected together over the Internet of course that share files or information of some sort without a central server there's no Central server in a peer-to-peer Network the the interactions the transactions the transfers go directly from one computer to another or medication for multiple computers to two others
 and she looks like I'm a new user who is joining this pier to pier network does Bitcoin Network how do I get started one I'd recommend you probably don't of the of the support network doing Bitcoin transactions to self put in Turkey was just pointing at work I want to get involved as a consumer I want to have a Bitcoin wallet I want to have some money what does that mean like what how do I get a Bitcoin wallet how do I get some Bitcoins well there are numerous Services out there you can read my book in Google I'm being without pushing any of them coin basket there's 10 of them out there probably the easiest way is to find a Bitcoin exchange in which there are dozens if not hundreds of them out there in different countries and and we'll talk about Bitcoin not being centralized what it kind of is with some of these Bitcoin exchanges because they try and facilitate the transactions so the easiest way to go to it is too you'll go to a bit
 find strange create an account and buy some Bitcoins what you can do with a credit card is worth $286 or whatever the prices at this hour and you give him your money the create a Bitcoin for you now the confusing thing to the general public is that there is return my Bitcoin but there are no such things as Bitcoins you know there is no physical coin there's no paper money involved in Bitcoin in fact there's not even a digital file that used to run your computer that is a Bitcoin no Bitcoins essentially don't exist within the Bitcoin ecosystem what exists our records of the transactions and the records are those transactions are stored in digital wallets so when you want to get involved with Bitcoin you have to install a digital wallet at an open-source piece of software on your computer or your smartphone or tablet or whatever for that man
 if you go to send a big Bitcoin exchanges they will have cloud-based digital wallets for you okay and this wallet this piece of software will store records encrypted records mine you of all your Bitcoin transactions so every time you make a transaction you'll get a new address for that transaction will be stored in your digital wallet based on those transactions the wallet calculates how many Bitcoins you have but in and of itself you're not storing a Bitcoin file you just throwing a record of those transaction so if you get involved with this you go to one of these Bitcoin exchanges you either download the digital wallet software onto your computer or you decide to use with their cloud-based digital wallet you get all the encryption keys that you need to access your wallet and then you start buying and for that matter even selling Bitcoin and that's probably the easiest way for an individual to get into an obviously you can also exchange Bitcoins from person to
 person without using an exchange cousin exchange will take a little bit off the top you know but you know if it's you and me exchange Bitcoin we don't have to give anybody anything and but again you all the transactions still go out to the network to get verified and added to the blockchain even if it's just us two individuals or we would have sensually send transaction records uniform my wallet to your wallet and we would exchange Bitcoin in that manner and what time think if you're buying something if you go to a site like over overstock.com or tiger software whatever tiger software is called you today you would pay you essentially by sending funds from your Bitcoin wallet to the Retailer's Bitcoin wallet
 and once I have my wallet I can participate in transactions like you said so for example I can find somebody who has Bitcoins and need some programming work done so let's say like I want to get Bitcoins I have no but I start with 0 Bitcoins I just had my wallet and I just want to do some programming work and I want to get paid in Bitcoins so I'm going to go and do the work and then they're going to pay me a Bitcoin and now I've participated in the Bitcoin e-konomy just as a simple consumer Orwell a worker however you want to describe it but what if I now find out that I was doing programming work for something some malicious site some like a porn site or something I don't want to want this on my record but the thing is you know my transaction is it going to be broadcast to the entire network and everybody is going to know that I've contributed code to like at leeno porn site or something malicious how private are my transactions
 sing them to the entire Community that's an excellent question and it's one that's difficult to explain in to grasp but essentially well the transaction is public that is this wallet sent to Bitcoins to that wallet the identity of the wallets are private so that we know that this transaction took place we don't know who it was
 and that's the Privacy part in any can't trace it back cuz World talking about me I'm very strong encryption here that the transaction exist but we really don't know who did the transaction that's a plus and a minus is a plus for anonymity right nobody knows that you work for corn side or that they paid you and overpaid you are underpaid you as a case maybe but also it also me because it's totally Anonymous if you lose your wallet
 you can't just go up to the blockchain and say hey that was my transaction so give me my money is lost do you know so you don't because of the anonymity you are also kind of a risk cuz there's no back up there but it is anonymous so if you're doing you know stuff you don't want people to know about and be quite honest I see some subset of the Bitcoin economy is in illegal activities that you know if you want to buy illegal drugs are our pay for a hit on your ex wife or what not you know this is a pretty Anonymous way to pay for it but I'm not saying that the majority of Bitcoin it's not but it is in a part of the put it another way Bitcoin is a majority of the payment structure of illegal activities but not answering the other day and make these transactions and again the transactions are public but who's doing the transactions and for what and why and we're totally private
 right okay so now let's say I want to actually mine some Bitcoins I've got my wallet and I was a caution to any listeners obviously you know you probably don't want to get involved in mining and we'll get into why you don't want to but but what else hypothetically if I wanted to get involved in mining what else do I need to get started well to get involved in mining you need a computer that can do this kind of Brute Force high speed calculation you said oh I got a computer to sitting over in the corner let's just use that computer you could okay the problem is you're competing against people and organizations who have much much more powerful computers because I mean let's say that I forget what the current rate of a Bitcoin mining in today but tell me what say that you weren't yeah I think 22 2425 somewhere so you weren't 25 Bitcoin well at 280 bucks and do the math hear that song
 show me five hundred bucks or so I'm saying right that that you would learn that that that's not small change right like to earn 7500 bucks today just by having my my spare computer do some transactions for me the problem is lots of other people would too so you're competing with organizations entities some individuals who have invested a lot of money and some very powerful computers are companies out there that sell mining computers and use computers cost $10,000 or more they're not you know what you buy at Best Buy right there even more powerful than the typical gaming computer to the fact that the best ones are purpose-built for this purpose and they you consume a lot of energy that can smell out of processing time to get this done so there's a huge in if you're going to compete in Bitcoin mining there's a huge investment involved and you're probably not going to do with just one computer I mean the biggest Bitcoin miners have no factories or warehouses full of these computers
 and what the what we discovered is that it isn't actually the cost of the computer that's the biggest expense is the cost of the energy running the computers at some point you start painting on the price of Bitcoin on any given day you can actually spend more in energy costs an electrical cost then you earn back in Bitcoin mining so what we find is a lot of the Bitcoin mining organizations have their facilities where energy is cheap you know where that they're able to use hydroelectric energy or un countries or areas where the electricity cost for a lot cheaper than it would be less a in downtown Manhattan so it can be profitable and that there are individuals and companies and it made a lot of money from mining bitcoins it's actually working through hashing through all these transactions the investment and the continuing expensive powering these computers makes it something for only the big boys to play in
 but my supercomputer I've moved to China I'm living on the edge of a hydroelectric Dam do I need to know so I got my setup Linares Irving my warehouse or whatever do I need to go and download like the entire past history of the blockchain do I just like plug into it somehow what like what are the what is the setup what are the minutiae that I need to know where software you need to use which is me I'm not much is open-source stuff cgminer easyminer Baba Blinder open source software you can download you got to have your own Bitcoin wallet involved in the process you're going to have to be downloading the blockchain as well and that might take a little bit of time initially but you got the computing power there
 answer to that car I mean it but obviously it is growing with every single transaction so so it is a little bit of a deal it's not raining I would our computers but at least I would want to how is it not getting to the size where this is just like intractable to constantly verify this gigantic chain of transactions isn't it just doesn't get just get so big that that we can't you know we don't have the time to perform all the worker or is it just is a theoretical limit on this that in terms of its interesting the mining of Bitcoins that and this is kind of laid out in the weather we want to come guidelines are running behind Bitcoin but that the basis behind behind the whole concept is that at the very early stages where they're really trying just to attract
 my body to get involved you earn more Bitcoin for each mining transaction you know so it started I've got a chart somewhere in my book I can't find it right now where it started out just heard about your in the high number Bitcoins and after X number of transactions after xnor Bitcoins have been earned that rate goes down payment rate goes down and after X more transactions of rate goes down again so overtime noticed it was there any 25 Bitcoin today for transaction you know that that's going to go down to one at some point in time in the future the other thing that happens is there is a theoretical limit on the number Bitcoin so when we reach this limit which is not going to happen for dozens of years based on projections then that's all right that's probably closer to it then that'll be yet that'll be all the Bitcoin there
 station for mining is you know you're verifying transactions you spending all this computer resource to verify transactions and you get paid to verify the transactions so why would people still be incentivised to verify transactions that's a good question and I'm I'm not sure there's an answer to that other than a century from now we'll probably using something else and who knows what technology will be a graphic thing out there and that's a fair question right I think the general nature of why the payment rate declines is the expectation is that the value of Bitcoin increases
 right which it hasn't hasn't overtime I mean if you got into Bitcoin to 3 years ago that at the beginning through 4 years ago I need Bitcoins were worth a couple pennies
 and overtime that has increased today we're at 280 some bucks in Turnersville value of Bitcoin mining at the very beginning and you mind at the house in Bitcoins while you're sitting on some money right now right you know if you know if something is worth pennies back then is worth $280 today which now gets into the speculative nature of the currency which is how a lot of people view Bitcoin today not so much as a viable currency although what we talked about various ways that I can be there otherwise I can but I am most of the transaction volume today in Bitcoin is speculative people are buying at saying it's going to go up or they're shorting it's saying it's going to go down because it has I mean at one point about within the past year and a half or so Bitcoin Rose over $1,000
 predict coin in terms of value and you know certainly if you got into a Pennies on the dollar and it's now $2,000 wow what a deal walk now it's going down now we're 200 actually drop well below 200 earlier this year and now it's come up a little bit I mean it's very very volatile which makes it very difficult to use as an everyday currency but you know if you're speculating on it as you would with hog valleys and pork Futures and gold and diamonds you know it is interesting in terms of speculative currency and that is what the majority of the transactions are today is pure speculation people are gambling on it emphasized you know the practical application cuz the speculation tends to distract the mainstream media and lots of people who to see big numbers now it's money we got to spend
 my little brother was mining cryptocurrency is a few years ago and I would rebuke him for it because I was like this is some kind of scam you're panning for gold in ONN mini people just really have trouble understanding why Bitcoin is more than an item of speculation and maybe I don't know maybe the nature of this is a people don't understand why they're paper money is worth anything people don't really think about money it's become this background Axiom of of how the world works but you know it's worth talking about the speculation a little a little more and like how how big things could get like you think about like how people how rich people have gotten off of the internet like it's Bill Gates got rich off the internet and made you know you know previously unfounded sums of money and it makes you think like our are the
 wealthy of the future you know it's it's like a Fitbit coin is as big as you know some of the sum of its proponents say it is say it's literally like no on on scale with with how important the internet was are we going to have like a new order of magnitude of wealth in the world
 it all that that is an interesting question the whole and you're right. The whole speculative nature this really does behind us to to the importance of Bitcoin anything important importance is not that I can make you know billion dollars on a tour that somebody will or somebody has or somebody's lost a billion also I need somebody makes it somebody else loses it the importance is the technology behind it and how it can be centralized are transactions are currency transactions but you know what I mean you get into human nature and human the I mean I people just like to make a quick Buck they want something for nothing and the whole concept oh I can just let my computer run in the background and I can make money from that well that's appealing to some people somebody says wait if I buy something for $200 today and it's going to be worth $1,000 next month or 6 months from now will that appealing to I mean we like to gamble we like quick money and what has happened certainly over the past year probably more within the six-month past 6 months is that we have.
 another professional Financial speculators involved in Bitcoin I mean before a year or so ago it was a very small community of Traders it where did the Bitcoin congregation not an interesting combination of people you had the technology people the cryptologist who really founded that some of this is a cryptography Ching more than anything else so you have people here just theoretically into cryptography who found found it fascinating got into it you had welded the guys were doing it because it was totally Anonymous and they could Finance or illegal activities at those guys you have Libertarians Financial Libertarians who don't want government control and government centralization that this is an ideal currency for them to be involved with at least theoretically if not practically so you had this interesting Consortium of people coming from a lot of different angles into it or what you didn't have was a professional Financial people
 okay I mean it was techno Geeks in cryptographers and Libertarians but you know where was Wall Street well within the past year service in the past 6 months or so we've had more more professional Financial people get involved with this big as a speculative nature saying hey you know if we can invest in this if we can meet up with things go down the shore that were betting on where Beckett Bitcoins going to go so now we have the professional Finance guy sent it so if you look at the Bitcoin sites today versus looking at them a year ago they're emphasizing totally different things a year ago they were talking about the technology they were talking about you know how can we improve the Crypt ography and everything now it's just for where's the price going to go in there playing Financial models and I love watching The Price is going to be in exactly 7 days and because it follows this model and and and that's the world I'm not familiar with and don't wanna get familiar with but they're into it now and it's almost like that that's where the Bitcoin
 train is going today now whether they will get tired of that or not it is the question and whether it can settle back down and we can start talking about it as a viable currency again I got a year ago we were at Merchants are going to sign up to accept Bitcoin today is you want financial traders are dealing with it the world has totally shifted certain live in the past 6 months on bitcoin other again what's ironic is like yeah certainly they they have this focus on bitcoin and thinking of it in terms of a speculative currency or just the way to the centralize wealth into their own hands but again the real innovation of it is a decentralized and we haven't talked about much is that with the decentralized nature you can do micro payments and it allows you know if I want to pay somebody in Bangladesh you know like half a penny to do something that Debbie comes like a fee
 I don't know if half of pennies is reasonable doubt but one penny right like you know in the past you can't pay somebody a penny to do something cuz it doesn't look up halfway across the world like how am I going to send somebody halfway across the world of Penny it cost them more than a penny to send them that penny so so what did you sing is it adds a fine or degree of granularity to the global economy which is like spotless fundamentally game-changing and if you just think about that you know that's that's that's why this is so important that's what this war was one of the reasons why this is so important the fact that you can do that micro value transfer means that we can do if I have a Penny lying around it doesn't make sense for me to have that Penny cuz I can't do anything with it but somebody in Bangladesh could do something with a penny so that's I mean that's again at more macro stuff I do want to talk a little bit more about the engineering side of things could you describe what a mining pool is
 a mining pool is a collection of miners Bitcoin mining because of the cost of the computers well one thing at one way to do that is simply to spend the money right yes people or organizations have the money to do that investment the other way to get around it is to have multiple individuals gather together into a pool to do the mining and there are dozens of of mining pools out there that you can join so that you can apply your what whatever amount of computing power you have to the pool the pool works together essentially to to solve the equations in the calculations and hopefully you don't learn the Bitcoins from the for the mining there
 even in the end even in the mining pool though size matters that you're even within a mining pool you're competing with other minors with in that pool so if you think you can just get into it with a general laptop or something probably not going to work cuz you're not going to be participating much compared to somebody who's bring a lil bit more power to the pool that pools working now there's dozens of different ways in which they distribute the funds are kind of a first in first out who sold it first who sold it lasted some of them distributed more more equally Google mining pools you can find them and I talked about him a lot in the book also an interest of the best approaches to it but it is a way that New Guinea still work on that power users you're not talking about your aunt Nelly with an old laptop but another way for individuals to get involved in the Bitcoin mining be the mining pool be quite honest though you're not going to get rich at that cuz again you're still competing with the big
 big boys and I'm not sure how viable mining pools are going to be over the long term because of that mean honestly the end of the companies that are investing in Bitcoin mining are spending some very very big box and you're getting in a group of individuals together to compete against them might sound good on paper I'm not sure how long term viable that is mine is happening all around the world there is a possibility that two different legitament histories can develop and I've heard an analogy Bitcoin Fork I think I've heard it allergy between Bitcoin mining and like digging through layers of snow to get to the hardened earth below and so the analogies that like the top layers of the blockchain are mutable you know they're wet and slushy and they can shift around and they can change but the ground beneath as you go back in history along the blue
 chain you get to firmer and firmer truth until it's at the toilets true that the entire world has consensus around and so this is kind of like just how the history of the world war world view of how history is it's not a 7 start somewhat subjective but over time we increasingly agree on what the past is and how we should frame the past so could you explain this analogy a little bit more and maybe you could Define what a Bitcoin Fork is where it has to do with things being done in multiple places in real time by different people or entities in that you know I'm a I'm working on this particular block over here somebody else is working on a different block over their actions within the block what exactly my block gets added to the version of the blockchain I have on my computer that other person's block gets added to his version of the blockchain that he has on his computer.
 talk to each other yet right I don't know about his work he doesn't know about my work we have essentially created two different versions of the blockchain or what we called blockchain Fork now I start my version of the blockchain starts getting propagated through the network the other person's version of the blockchain with with his block at it starts getting propagated to the network so at the very initial stages we've got multiple versions of the blockchain out there now the older parts of both watching Zara denticle
 identical it's just this newer bit that's been added is what's different and what has to happen over time and it happens actually quite rapidly is that the two versions get to get mashed together and and they get synchronized essentially so that my block will be added to that person blockchain and that person is blocked will be added my versus the blockchain and we will have the same blockchain now by the time that happened somebody else's created a new block over here somebody else is created a new black over there so again we got different versions of the blockchain on the tail and write the head and the body is constantly being filled with and that comes into synchronization overtime as the different versions of the blockchain you don't merge and get put together it it it it sounds like oh man it's a big problem but but but it works itself out much faster than you would think and it is a say I like the snow analogy but you know it is almost like having snakes with different tails
 out there that eventually the tales merch together and talk show economics if Bitcoin is so great why are new cryptocurrencies being created well it's more of a technological reason than anything else and that covers in the technical people behind it think they can do a better job is trying to improve the technology you know it's not that Bitcoin is perfect it isn't it in it and it wasn't the first to go down this route and it won't be the last to go down this route it just it put everything together in the right way at the right time now since then we have other currencies out there that and if you go to you know a lot of these Bitcoin exchanges they're actually cryptocurrency exchanges they exchange more than just Bitcoin but the thinking is well you know Bitcoin did it this way but it has these fault so can we improve on that so you have
 literally over a hundred different cryptocurrencies all taking the same blockchain type based approach but tweaking it here and there to try and know if there's that little issue over here will I can we fix that little issue and can we do without introducing new issues and he has the way technology works there just trying to improve technology going to be here you know 20 years from now I don't know probably not but I'm sure cryptocurrency will be in it'll be something that looks like Bitcoin but it's just been improved because it got a different trip to cryptographic algorithm behind another approaching things just a little different or what not trying to work The Kinks out of it
 like the US dollar that we have around today is nothing that we had 50 years ago we could say it now it's all digital now we have derivative we have all kinds of all kinds of a new innovations that have been built sort of a top of the US dollar but we don't think of it as as this updated changed change the entity so what else is going on in the blockchain space that we haven't talked about that is exciting to you
 well I think the progress on this rain has slowed a little bit but it but it is happening is the using it in in terms of currency that looking at trying to make a little bit more mainstream I mean be honest though you know if you were dealing in Bitcoin at your house you're doing a Bitcoin today it is a bit of a hassle is not as easy as you're putting in your PayPal address in in coming over your credit card okay there's a lot more involved which is why you know might my Aunt Judy is never going to get involved with this it's this point in time and I'd never recommend that she did I would get no into phone calls but I'm sore but the movement is to make it more user-friendly and to make it more mainstream so and and to try and take some of the risk out of it by your not having a centralized entity you know do the guarantees but having individual entities have a little bit more in terms of guarantees that is some of the newer exchanges which they're not even calling Celtics
 Angels anymore that. Try and have a little bit more guarantee in terms of your what happens to your transactions and that sort of thing and I think that makes sense if if it is to be a currency and not just a means of speculation that it needs to be more user-friendly it needs to have some some guarantees behind it I mean I know it's not going to be like the government standing behind it but at least if you got a company standing behind your transactions a big company you know the founder scene that's working on this you got the Winklevoss twins working on it you've got some big entities not just guys in the basement anymore but real Financial people getting involved with it and that comes with pluses and minuses and pluses as it's trying to make it more user-friendly easier for individuals to get involved with us obviously some of the die-hard people are posted this sort of thing that direction that they might have liked but you know if I know if you and I
 how to use Bitcoin to pay for online transactions at wherever it's got to be easy to use got2b Isuzu uses PayPal or credit card so I think there's that movement happen I think it slowed some what of light as the prices fluctuated so much yeah yeah I hate to always think of Bitcoin in terms of price but that really isn't important thing I mean we've paid the price go from 0 to a thousand and back down to 200 and I mean you don't want to get involved with something to say that vulnerable stabilizes if it plays out in the 250 to $300 range and it kind of stays there now the financial guys aren't going to like it because they don't have the big game but the people who use it it's just as more stable now I know that if I'm buying a big screen TV today that that's worth one and a half Bitcoins it's not worth 3 and it's not worth 5 I know that is proximally 1 1/2 Bitcoins
 and we can deal with it that way and for it to be a viable currency it has to stabilize the speculation as to there's always going to be speculating if it goes up $4 and $1,000 for speculation switch that they will always be speculation but it needs the Vault The Vault ability needs to decrease and used to stabilize more and I don't know whether we're seeing that yet or not certainly for the past 4 or 5 months or so it's been kind of in this 250 to $300 range and that's a start that will get you know when it's stable we will be less interested in speculation and more interested in making this work you know whether that with the technology behind the scenes or the technology in the interface to get it to the end user but you know who said I wanted some technology that's important not the price on this thing says if the price has to stabilize and then we can focus more on watch real behind a pole cryptocurrency thing
 the clothes off part of the motivation within this podcast is to iron out some of the elitism that is in the world of software engineering because most of the guests that I have on software daily are people who are very familiar with deeply technical topics distributed systems is there people that have started computer science and study programming all their lives but the thing is that the space of what we call software engineering is growing so much and at the same time the space of things that are not affected or are not in the scope of software engineering that's kind of Contracting and so you're part of part of the motivation for this podcast is to act is to be accepting and to be inviting of people who are not traditional software engineer people into the fold of the world of software engineering and computer science
 not only because they think they can and they should be here but because we need them essentially so so that's part of the motivation for for bringing you on the on the podcast and you and you've been so so great and so good until explanatory at at at explaining the aspects of Bitcoin that are are hard for even Engineers to understand but you know people like my parents right or my sister they should be able to understand this stuff because there's no opting out right there's no opting out in the future of technology you can just say I'm going to go and do this this career that doesn't involve technology because those careers are all going away and so you know that's part of the motivation for this want to get some idea do you have any since you're not like a programmer but you you were able to learn this stuff on your own this is a brand new technology and you're not like some
 young spry 13 year old with you no justice neuroplastic brain how is it that you were able to learn this brand new topic of everything you need to know about Bitcoin to write a book called The Ultimate Guide to bitcoin will thank you for not referring to me as a 13 year old Sprite whatever but this will date me I did programming in colleges in Fortran on Punch Cards I mean I know that that dates me unfortunately and then be based programming whatever so that bad way back in the past. I think the key thing with any technology especially the people who create the technology that people listen to this podcast is it's very easy to get caught up in the technical details that's what you do everyday right you're in there digging to the bits of cold you're making sure that this works with this and you don't get an error message you know I mean that's what you do every day it is very easy to lose sight of what that
 knowledge is going to be used for and who's going to be using it on my background really is in marketing I am a writer but I went to college got a marketing degree and one of the nice things about marking one of the focus is on marketing as you always focus on the user for the customer back my Mantra throughout all the years is always been think like the customer you know I really don't care that much about the nuts and bolts of the technology because there are guys would do to her lesson this podcast and no work it out I mean you can work out just about anything right you got the smart guys and rec room but what's important is you serve the needs of the user of the customer and you make the cut the technology work towards those needs so I'm always thinking about okay well I'm thinking about my Aunt Judy or my or my brother or the neighbor across the way or what not and how they use the technology and then then we can backtrack then we can figure out how to build what it is for them but you got to figure out what it is
 you want to do and what it is they need to do and in the case of the scripto currency thing you say okay well how you know My Neighbor Next Door how in the world does this affect them and today the answer is really not much but it could for this reason and this reason this reason and then you start back friends will what's important to that and what builds that and what feeds that and just how much information do you really need to know you know to delve into this and not today because we are in the united we were in the automobile industry were in the age where people are kind of bringing along a writing mechanic with them the things going to break down somewhere between here and there you know where in the very very early stages of this of the scripture technology measured in years not even a decade saw in the early stages of anything you got to know a lot more about it cuz you got to get your hands more dirty and because of that my neighbors are not going to get involved with that cuz they're busy cleaning your pool and cutting the grass right now taking the kids to soccer lessons but
 you know 5 years from now when this becomes a lot more, and becomes let you use the ass then they probably will be involved in it and they will need no less about the technology that point because of Technology will become more visible I mean I know
 I don't know how my toaster works but I do but you know you don't have to all you can eat knows what a piece of toast in it and it works well you know for technology to to go out to the general populace that how it has to be and India of the LA right listen this podcast you're sitting there you know I'm taking the toaster apart put it back together and I can work better and that's great and we need that but let's not lose sight in the whole process of cruise using the toaster and what to use in the toaster for and maybe they want a better piece of toast or whatever but you know I always try to step back a little bit from the nuts and bolts and say okay why using that's why do they want out of it and the other day really don't care whether you use this programming language of that foreign language your you know what I'll just Library you use behind it that you know that that that becomes irrelevant important to our building things but not the people who are using thing so you know how I teach myself I start with the end-user and work backwards and that's how I I do any technology
 awesome Michael Dillard thanks so much for coming out to software engineering daily it's been a real pleasure chatting with you
 been nice being here with you two to chat

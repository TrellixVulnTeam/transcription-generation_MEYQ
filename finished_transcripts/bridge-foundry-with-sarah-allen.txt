Transcription: technology careers are not as accessible to certain demographics such as women or minorities Sarah Allen is working to change that through education and Outreach Sarah created Rails Bridge and Bridge Foundry a pair of organizations working to make technology more accessible to people who are under-represented in technology Rails Bridge workshops are a fun and free way to get started with Ruby rails or other Technologies Rails Bridge was so successful that Sarah created Bridge Foundry which has an even wider variety of free workshops from clojure to go to mobile this is an inspirational episode of software engineering daily and it's a great opportunity for anyone who is looking to learn how to build a community before we get to my conversation with Sarah let's hear from a sponsor that keeps the Lights On It software engineering daily
is a software engineer you have tremendous leverage in the employment Market every company needs software engineers and these companies are all competing for you the engineer a scarce resource but as an individual engineer you don't have much insight into this incredibly opaque Market that's where hired.com comes in hard, signs you a talent Advocate who works to understand your needs and works to find you the perfect job go to hired.com se daily to try out the platform today and get a $2,000 bonus if you find a job the companies on hired compete for you the engineer and then make bids to win your talent these are companies like Facebook and Uber companies that we know are on The Cutting Edge of engineering because they've come on software engineering daily to talk about their Tech stack
I have used hired personally and I've experienced firsthand the ease of finding a well-paid enjoyable job this was way better than replying to LinkedIn messages from uninformed recruiters and is also certainly better than using a job search engine to find a great job and support software engineering daily go to hired.com se daily and get a $2,000 bonus upon finding a job check it out it would support the show now let's get on with the show
Sarah Allen is the founder of Rails Bridge in the leader of bridge Foundry these are two organizations working to make technology more accessible to people who are under-represented in technology and more generally they are part of a learn-to-code movement they were trying to cover on software engineering daily Sarah was on the previous episode talking about 18f Sarah welcome back to software engineering daily thank you it's great to be here talk about before we talked about Rails Bridge and Bridge Foundry let's talk more broadly about diversity why is it important to make Tech more diverse
that is a great question there's a lot of research that supports it in general diverse teams have better outcomes and more creative more ideas also believe it up necessity when you have it you have to create a forum for discussion that allows for different opinions and different perspectives shows that in lots of different mention dimensions of diversity about technology these days is software and Hardware is because the world fundamentally different ways that it was 20 30 50 years ago and if we don't have all of the people represented in the creation activities I don't believe we're going to end up with the solutions that we need for our society the power set of potential things week
Explorer is so giant we need all the help we can get and all the different perspectives to explore these different Avenues of technological Advance is very simply we have a talent French and we're not looking at all the prospective how I feel like we are in a what may be a permanent transition from this economy of mostly kind of the service worker economy in the in the industrial lock assembly line manual labor commodity worker economy to the knowledge worker economy and I think it's it's almost impossible to understate how crucial this transition is would you say that's accurate yeah I think that is analogous to the Industrial Revolution where we change our society functions they changed the definition for
we changed a lot of how individuals contributed to society the Industrial Revolution and I think that now it's a challenge for society opportunity it means that we have to be to have a more educated populace is the economic necessity I mean the kind of the idea of the Industrial Revolution was that you know it was an economic necessity that we taught people some degree of compliance some degree of ability to work together or not and I don't say this in a critical fashion was just we had a lot of assembly-line type job so that got baked into the education system because that is what people got fired for was the ability to fulfill these types of jobs but that job desirability landscape has changed so given that change what are the
first principles of education and particulate coating technology education that we need to start thinking about and baking into our educational processes sign that I think is not backed into a lot of our educational processes and most people don't think about it is that we good thinkers naked problem solvers people who have incredibly good communication skills and this is not something that people normally think of when you think of coders you think of people who send wild there still opportunity for individuals who like to work that way to contribute the majority of software development is teams for
and the other thing is that we see a lot of software that fails because people don't understand the problem and the more that we compartmentalize the other people who talk to people versus the coders the more that we are ineffective at having Dakota to the understand the problem and solution that will work in the market more for the people and so these new may not really new but their newly dominant or at least emerging I don't know if it's a majority of the industry but it's certainly a growing part of the industry that does human centered design and user research is a part of the software development practice those skills need to be acquired by coders
maybe are not going to be saying if I'm coding and they don't even know how to code but then the coders need to be involved in that process or I don't think we have
 right okay so we've highlighted kind of the the educational transformation that were undergoing with highlighted the need for diversity and Rails Bridge and Bridge Foundry these two organizations that you're involved in are both instrumental in trying to inspire the surf change that we need to remedy these these problems are these changes so what is Rails Bridge surround spray who started in 2009 as a wheelie it was a organization that
 they grew out of the Rails community and out of his desire to create the community that we have wanted to be in you know that there are a number of people who felt that some of the louder voices in the Ruby and rails Community were not representative of the environment that we wanted to work in order to create an environment where Java programmers are windows for Raptors or people who never written before would feel welcome and and that our software and their events would be places that would welcome also different kind of people
 and so the this this selection bias in the Ruby Community led to sort of an egregious disproportion of men versus women although I'm sure there are all kinds of other accys that Define under-representation we can talk about minority status Show on in 2009 you know you kind of had this this realization what was the gender distribution like back then and what when perhaps the ethnic distribution that were alarming to you and how has this changed in the last six or seven years they had been to studies a couple of years before that it determined that in open source
 I'm all contribution not just coding by Community Management or documentation had two to 3% women which is much much last year that the numbers of the time we're saying that as industry is a fall soccer development had 25 30% of women depending on how you count and I understand our population is 50% x 8 more than 50% of things but we were also seeing I don't know statistics on it but honestly white not even a lot of Asians and I think that has a lot to do with the San Francisco texting at that time was um predominantly white and you know where as I think in the South Bay you saw more of an Asian population and and very young that there was like when I was starting in
 90s it was the prevailing wisdom was that you know I don't have to actually start a company and then most people today don't realize that this celebration of young Founders and this feeling like well we have to have found you know fun the 20-something thing was really new in the 2000 Sprite or maybe late 90s for that like if you wanted to find a company straight out of college like you had to find me or you wouldn't be taken seriously so we were in the startup situation where a lot of their young people wear the bias that wow you know if you were 30 something or God forbid 40 or 50 something not only are you not likely to know this new technology but you probably can't learn it
 play which is ageism same things that I've really kind of wanted to attack or I should say attack but least disentangle on software engineering daily this idea that we have this neuroplasticity that just breaks down over time and we become Frozen in the set of skills will become completely unable to reinvent ourselves I think this is one of the craziest societal miss the we have pervading our world table if they understand you know like independent like the human patterns they know how to like show up and work
 we may understand patterns but there are things that I have been doing and software right since you know I started in the eighties and nineties that I'm still doing today but they are the fear not the language in the sink back there the patterns and then I draw from that experience to make really good software and I know people who were programming in the sixties or seventies that I really value when I have the opportunity to work with them because they really understand the roots of our industry understand protocols iPhones like I was doing in college and and I think that if we could grow a greater appreciation of what people with different experiences bring to the table it's going to make as much more powerful this afternoon on the team
 right okay so let's get back to talking about the women issue specifically they can almost use this as the base case for any sort of you know diversity problem because the women issue is so egregiously dis imbalanced so why are women so under-represented in Tech is there this assumption that maybe these women aren't in Tech because they're not interested like what where is this coming from is a bias in our society at all levels right we are seeing this in every single industry that most famous in some way that has been historically male-dominated and you know how do we create opportunities for everyone
 expertise that somehow you know women are only qualified to do things that are somehow biologically linked and that women are somehow less capable in math and science which is true and actually if you ever want to think about things in a different way that's a fabulous essay by Gloria Steinem call. If men could menstruate well then of course they would be better astronomers because they're in touch with the cycles of the heavens and all about the way that if they in a man could have this capability then it would make them more expert in somewhere I love it I love it that's a girls are great commentary so I think we have a society
 I was right that cause women to have like you know I'm being shut out in some way from also and we have all the kids stuff we're like they've done studies where when is one computer in the house sits in the boys room and that's the thing right but I think that I have never thought about that one you know my I don't think my sister had a computer growing up then and I got from upper middle-class family there's no reason why my sister should not have been exposed to the same degree that my brothers were given opportunity and I don't think I don't I guess I don't I shouldn't comment on that cuz I don't know that but now that's just one of these are the strange things you know you get pointed out to that like in to be subtle societal signals in the closer you look it's always there's more and more and more and more of these
 software industry is it completely defies logic because the software industry was created by women so in the forties largely because of the war that they know if men were there wasn't that many men available to do the work during the war that supported these new machines but then there was a difficult work was creating the machines and that creating a programming was something that you could give to let you know kind of secretaries other games do the software programming but the you know all of the software development during the war was really done by these women math majors and then called computers
 and I used to refer to it like in the thirties in twenties as pink color work
 because because you know if you were a woman mathematician they were actually little opportunity for you except in these these roles which area exactly demanding but not considered to be it was considered to be any more support work
 and I'm so anyhow our industry was really created by women and but when it was recognized as an industry it became a male-dominated industry all throughout the 60s and 70s you know you know Barbara list off and I mean it you might have been even later incredible women like you know inventing algorithms unit subroutine was invented by a woman you know this history is not well understood right well known well documented in an old and recently people keep honor thing like
 in the common narrative about programming about what what are history is and then the other thing that is a huge Dynamic today is that the women who do become your science degrees or enter the field are they leaving maybe faster than they were arriving which I don't think is technically possible except there were more before we got to I think almost 40% women are graduating with computer science degrees and then of course only 40% of people in our industry you have people coming in from all different feels so these are women who enter the workforce maybe as a software engineer while they're in the software engineering Workforce their receipt
 show many repeated microaggressions or miniature signals that they do not belong that they are subjugates of the their male counterparts and they just get fed up and leave your science degrees
 two-thirds of them leave before they've been in the industry for 3 years and then of the rest of the population which is somehow she has to be some don't buy the 10-year Mark half will have left so we have hundreds of thousands of women with computer science degrees who are just not working a software developer and my theory is supply and demand they think that's we have a supply problem in you know underrepresented minorities and women I think we have a demand problem where we don't have whether we have a different supply problem where we don't have enough good job where anybody would want to work yes

 get back to the things that you can't on me like writing code
 the problem and when the surrounding problems for a long time let's talk about Solutions so you work on you work on Rails Bridge you work on bridge Foundry I want to go back to the first Workshop that you did with Rails Bridge so you know you noticed this crazy gender distribution you said I want to do something about this you announced a workshop to do what I noticed that I had to learn rails for like 3 years and then I was like through Workshop where we taught rails and then some of those women who might want to stay in the community or find the most pleasurable
 experience I've had onboarding with any type of framework I don't know if you share that experience across your Computing career that is longer than mine but for me it was a really really just enjoyable experience and Dad and from rails new whatever to having something that was a working at that I could share with people so I think it is to learn rails it is a great experience if your role is to be productive quickly and doing something complex and you have experience and software developer it is nutty like I had imbc I watch NBC happen right I go into rails and trails names patterns as if it's the implementation is the pack a little but in the end it doesn't always get it the way that you would expect like the MVC pattern and rails like you got these
 the fact that you know you're in a controller and you make a instance variable that is available in your view which is another like class so wait is it still object-oriented programming I thought this was Ruby what day is that deceptively easy and it's very quick that you get to ask Will if we're getting good enough to do something complex is then completely hard to Grapple with riding at that point so what we did I'm intentionally was to build excitement about from both non-programmers and programmers to use this this framework
 what we did unintentionally is we created you know what some people refer to as a community of practice so we created a network of people who were in a women and men who were all connected to each other all learning at same time and sharing skills which means that when you hit this class if you have people to talk to which typically as a woman it's a little awkward to be the only woman in the virtual room when you have questions right and you all your quote friends might be somebody who wants to date you and it's kind of weird sure it can get in the way of the actual learning but by you accidentally created a network effect within a a mostly female ruby-on-rails introductory environment which was perfect because the the canonical thing that was happening in in this type of work shop is
 you know the new developer starts learning if she's a woman she gets to this Cliff where it gets really complex and difficult the only people she can ask are males which is not inherently a problem but it's much better for her to be in an environment where she's surrounded by plenty of females that she can talk to you so you had this first Workshop you you started to I guess so what was the sequence of events that unfolded where you started to realize this type of network effect was happening and then because we had a teacher is half women Half Men teachers
 lots of GA child care it's really awesome and that magical so fun and people were really excited about the whole phenomen like it the whole Community came out and supported us afterwards people were like how do we help and so the next week that we had a pivotal labs they Janice Lee holstead ass in the city and what surprised me is we had a lot of people who have been to the first Workshop also from the second worked out and it's became a pattern which I didn't expect to buy our plan compound interest to you wouldn't expect that somebody would do that since we had different different levels and they were small groups so that each teacher would kind of take it in whatever Direction their students would want to learn it was a really great environment for people would rebuild the same Apple
 again and get a little deeper like to be able to ask those questions like okay what's exactly going like when I do you know whales generator model or scaffolding died in the different parts of the app and then overtime become more expert and then we would encourage the TA is too then teach people to go from student to teacher pay teacher and that learning path is a very very effective one if you and what we've seen subsequently like in Southpoint years I really recognize that the best teachers were the newest Learners and then we would put the experts in the TA roll
 cuz it's much harder to go like untangled what's some weird things over these types of the question you don't know the answer and it creates a collaborative environment and you're actually learning How We Do software Concepts how do you problem solved together and what I realized more recently is we started to expose this very different culture in software development to people who are so there was some counterintuitive lessons that you learned along the road to building this organization so at a certain point you know Rails Bridge is getting popular and you start thinking about scaling it it starts to move to other cities naturally what happens
 first year we sort of randomly went other cities like I went to Cambridge and we just went and saw that it was really replicable and then plan had been to do this for one year
 but the internet our goal was to get to 20% to go from 3 to 18% in
 in one year and what we were tracking was the number one who showed up to the meet up and we actually met that goal 6 months later
 nice very nice so then we really had a brainstorm where it was actually or intake after work and who said if money wasn't an issue like supposed to just an odd that we can give you that and what we realized was we are at I'm getting sponsorships from companies were trying to hire whales engineers and so it wasn't like getting
 people to step up and play the organizer bowl and and connecting the money to the people right so that we could have developed a mantra is that we would let nothing get in the way of having a workshop that's a great Mantra touches on one of the things that has cat cropped up as a theme in a couple places along the shows that we've done on software engineering daily as they tear that leadership is extremely scarce and I guess you know maybe this comes back to the whole assembly line Industrial Age bake baked into US type of thing but nobody teaches leadership nobody stress is it and I think there's almost in in the program in community I think there's almost a notion of Shame around you know stepping up and being a leader I don't know if there's this sort of like underdog
 dogs being associated with programming I'm not exactly sure what it is but or like this allergy to management so how have you solve that problem have you gone people to become leaders of Rails Bridge meetups or workshops that some people have this assume correlational tactical stealing your shift or not are not as people develop leadership skills that we found is that people really
 what do you notice in this is anecdotally that women and men would come to the leadership roles differently the often you to ask people why they were teaching and men would say while I wanted for my communication skills I see this is a networking opportunity and women it was that I had you know which is I think really interested right so where were in this environment right where it where open source is very high and rightfully so women don't have spare time their society right women do the most of the childcare women are responsible for their family household cleaning stuff at my house if I suck at that but other women do that kind of work
 efficient because they're not as entitled as MLP yours so why are we I know some people challenges why we ate demanding this right here work like the PGA is dominated by women like you know nonprofits are so I think that there is a to that's your leadership question there
 I think that we really set it as
 and expectation so at the end of every Workshop
 I typically say hey dude everybody did you like this you got a lot out of it and I never been at a workshop where everybody was
 and I'm going to say well if you want this to continue wearing all volunteer organization we need volunteers and that one of the things that we did that was very effective I'm not sure that everybody would have done this but Sarah and I were both I was like running my own company I was also there was a full-time folder we were both moms you know that we had little kids at home like this was not an easy lift for us so we made a commitment to each other to do this for a year in January which is halfway through a little over halfway through the year serme and you and I you and it was our volunteer coordinator for the first year
 got together we made these Workshop recipes for who wrote down all the things that we do so that other people could do it and then it never works out I said we need new organizers and nobody steps up and then finally in April I asked to women to co-organizer was organized by Melanie Archer and I can't remember but these two women who are awesome leaders and then at the end of the workshop and there was nothing on the calendar and people said when's the next workshop and I said I don't know
 there will be another Workshop when someone organist I think that you like sometimes you have to leave space for the years right as fascinating so tricky to teach this and then it's I think I think it's impossible to get to the point to where we have like too many leaders like I think everybody could be a leader and that would be the ideal scenario so I know if you're listening to this and you know you spent a lot of your day like complaining about the problems in your organization probably you can improve some of those by becoming later but that's more broad advice so let's talk about the the extrapolation of Rails Bridge to bridge Foundry you learned these counterintuitive lessons about building an organ is
 Asian about the workshop model about the fact that you can't just inject money into this organization have it grow like a weed so you took these lessons and you replicated it in the form of bridge Foundry what is Ridge Foundry so we spend a few years just Geographic expansion and we had this we get some some stats when I last checked about a year ago we were in 52 cities will wear some of them are like San Francisco will often have two workshops a month sometimes it's one of quarter sometimes it's if you know different different Kneaders in different places there they're typically teams of people who are taking turns doing this Workshop organizing and teaching and we've replicated this
 students become teenagers become teachers and then the organizer it's always a challenge to find organizers and and overtime we like to keep working on how to create leadership roles in ways that are supportive and helpful so other projects that was originally not just the workshops we had a teaching kids initiative we had on we just like a 2011 we did Wales mentors like his online site for people to help each other and they're like a dozen different little projects but it was the workshops that really took off and people started using Rails Bridge like as I know this weekend
 so we recognize that Rails Bridge we had become synonymous with the workshop at the same time there were all of our all of our stuff all of our materials are processes is explicitly open source
 anyone can take our materials you can do anything with them if you call it Rails Bridge it must be free and it must be an Outreach activity but if you want to just use our materials just learning and teaching your office go team you know we want this you know we want people to learn and so what happened is there were other organizations that were just like okay you know they were like 3 different python organization the Boston python workshops and Pie ladies and Pi * that like far the model and make things happen and there was a scholar Workshop but what we noticed is that we welcome people about the other Technologies to work with us
 but people didn't they made it their own separate organizations which is formally what we said we was fine but we thought there be more power if we all banded together in and shared a little more closely so we have this hypothesis that the name was getting in the way so what we did was we created we took the organization Bridge Foundry became the name of everything that wasn't the rails workshops
 and then Rails Bridge was just the rails workshops
 great so some of the things that have grown out of this this refactoring are mobile Bridge closure Bridge a bridge and so these are respectively you know mobile development development with the language go and developing with the language closure sew-in closure for example the I often think of these is more advanced language is maybe that's maybe I'm off base on that but like our are the goals with with meetups like clojure bridge in go Bridge are they similar to those of Rails Bridge or are you catering to more advanced programmers object-oriented programming give me the time that people got object-oriented programming was objects
 you know when I like before that there was procedural programming we just do this do this do this do this and so first is the easy thing and that certainly for I think for certain types of people from Chopin certain type of problems functional programming you certainly easier until it's really about having different entry points and it's really about pink leveraging people's like motivation in the excitement we had we had Brian kernahan on the show actually he was talking about how he doesn't understand think this is Brian Carney Animal Control if I get this wrong but he's never really understood the JavaScript inheritance model cuz he's still kind of come from a C plus plus or Java background and then I've talked to people
 grew up in a JavaScript world and they have the converse problem you know they don't understand the Java inheritance model as well as the JavaScript model so okay so it comes to show so you know we we are rooted where anchored and the types of technologies that we start with so I assume you're saying that because clojure bridge and go Bridge are introductory meetups to new people new programmers well all of these things are for both experienced programmers
 we I think we're most well known for the new programmer stuff because I think those are the people who stay in the community the longest we have in my experience will always have like at least 20% probably sometimes are people who have programming experience or some programming experience they come and they spend less time in the cops because they need it last night like I know a woman who can see which one works she was a Java programmer 21 Workshop working thing she heard about this job as she went to the workshop and then and I think also we see people like not just women like men have his problem to another Java programmer for 10 years and they want to let you know JavaScript or something and they have no credibility of people are like you can't do anything else
 changes the conversation absolutely opportunities near who's excited about learning a new language so she's just issues to yourself go because she wants to do something new tell me some success stories of bridge Foundry and Rails Bridge so we had a number of people who started programming because of rails Bass Pro Shops are the most notably Rachel Meyer who went to the second Workshop I was not a programmer and maybe not even sure that she wanted to do it who she went to work after work shops Utah yourself programming she did a lot tremendous amount outside of work shop so that was a big motivator she became a teacher should give me an organizer
 and I really leader in our community and then in less than a year she was working so hard and we have a number of stories like that of people who are new to programming we also have stories of like you know women who become become that you hear about New Opportunities right so they come in as an experience developer they might be coming in to help teach or they might be coming in to learn a different technology like they're learning mobile instead of rails or vice versa and then because of the network effect and the other thing that we're doing which when ceremony with me and I were like 6 months and brainstorming but what are we doing a jobs program or is this
 we we we found that we valued the people who work becoming programmers as part of this like we saw women who would be like a b SEMO right there Chief marketing officer their company and they would come in and they were just like I just want to understand what you're doing and so they're just becoming more and more facile with the technology or just fun right and I remember hearing this story from somebody who had brought her friend who was a designer so this woman had never installed software on her machine before she would get that we require you to the Friday night we have like beer and pizza and start work on install fast cuz that's the hard part where you have to be like let me install
 franchino Brew install this and like you know all this before this little face ever seen and then it goes wrong sometimes and you know let's go untangle that and so here was somebody who had just like never even double plates installed anything and then she end this weekend and she's like she's just gained a whole set of just text bills so the word Sarah called that are all Tech skills the ambient level of Technology on most women wow okay so I love that because I am I have been trying to get my mom and my sister too
 engage with coding and Technology at some more granular level and I'm surely going to point them to this episode to listen to I've been trying to do this for like 3 or 4 years and
 and I'd say just have not had made any progress and it's really frustrating because I know that it's almost it's it's just like it's like it's like looking at a hammer from a distance mean like I don't know what that thing is for but once you pick it up and let you use it one or two times you instantly know oh this is how all these things in the world work this this explains nails to me it's hard because the beginning stuff for coding is the boring shitt right like when I first did the first time I installed males like it took me 3 days and I mean it was a long time ago but now I can when I can like IRB and whatever but that that insulation card is really like I don't know maybe some people like that I know
 that it's not just like there's a lot of people in the world right who don't like they did that becomes a barrier right they think that that's what Cody is because that's what that first exposed to and I think it's important to break that down and that's why I think we should teach one of the reasons speaking mystified and I need to have that experience so they know the difference perfect segue so should every kid learn to code absolutely okay and what are the hurdles I'm sure you've looked at this landscape you understand is landscape much better than I do what are the hurdles to getting every kid introduced to code to the degree that we need to
 what is a bunch of turtles I think it's really unfortunate that we have a new generation of computers where you have to install a whole bunch of stuff before you start coding it's very inaccessible now which I think is really unfortunate when I started coding you just a minute I'm glad we have a graphical user interface but it was fun like you you know you open the computer man lion you could print Sarah is amazing go to 10 you know I mean you have all screen phone to Windows machines I guess you would type basic right into the terminal and so it's gotten a little better I mean I was horrified when the iPhone in the iPad came out when you were making development environment on the iPad when it came out which I found like just the worst possible thing that could be done for a generation
 corrected but I think we've lost some of that initial enthusiasm to develop the kinds of things that would Empower kids I can she get a machine they should be accessible for them to make stuff on it so what you're saying is many the first computer many kids get is an iPhone or a iPad and these computers people don't even think of them as communication devices or phones couldn't be further from the truth and these do not make it easy to program where as a desktop computer is is now desktop computers to the de facto way to code there is nothing inherently prohibitive about coding on a mobile device other than the fact that Apple has kind of sandbox that functionality away
 like a really good and it's not considered to be a motivational gas to do it or maybe we just don't I don't know why it just isn't vitamins are not as accessible as they were in like the 80s for Kodi right and because I just don't come with right the Apple II came with a basic manual and I don't know whether that's the solution but it's crisp currently it's very it is a very difficult entry point for kids and then the other thing is at school at least in San Francisco and I think this is common in are in the United States that it's dominated by Windows machines that are completely locked down and and the kids are introduced to cook coding their introduced these fake things like kids really like to learn real things like they can detect that they're running some fake can sing and that's fine if it's
 like they don't mind if a kids thing that's like Halo Angry Birds coding.org stuff is that not up your alley I think that's positive direction well I think that I my ideal environment for kids would they would they were be building things that are real applications in some way
 yeah right like I when I learn basic I was writing the same code that people were writing when they wrote applications that you bought near absolutely the little kids since the veneer yeah I mean I wish I would have been doing programming instead of playing incredible machine which is kind of like the game that is where you solve problems I mean whatever I have no right to complain I've been playing that knows really enjoyable same thing as and I think it should be taught utility stuff I suppose they need to be able to reason with data like we have so much information now like what if they could you know like you know what if they were doing a Biology experiment they collected a bunch of data and then they like
 spreadsheet and then they will be able to do it on it except it's not like I was teaching science to a bunch of 1st graders and I talked to a friend of mine about was a scientist and I said well is hypothesis too big a word for these first graders and she said they all know what a tyrannosaurus is I think we we don't give our kids especially elementary school kids enough credit for how they are yes we do the Wii infantilize what sounds like yeah we infantilized the young and we accuse the old of being locked into their neuroplasticity the world is only for 20 and 30 somethings false false conclusions so okay so I want to begin to close off an
 and wrap this up this conversation up so you don't like this idea of everyone should learn to code or be exposed to cold I think there is some pushback to this and I think it's crazy that I think it's like these you know that this like 3% of scientists who don't think that climate change is a thing and they're so loud about it that they actually have some sort of sway I think at this point it's like not even a debate every kid should be exposed to code or learn how to code I think that should be the changing narrative but you know okay well just just to exemplify why it is important for everybody to be exposed to Kotor to learn to code or to learn to interact with coders at a bare minimum. If you weeks ago you wrote about cultural change
 facilitated by software this post is is not directly about Ridge Foundry I don't think but the subject is relevant is software changing our culture and how can it change your culture going into the future to give a brighter more diverse future
 we are so much more empowered as individuals
 now in this generation and ever before at least potentially right there with all due respect to the digital divide and that not everyone actually has access I think that that problem could be solved you know there's a bunch of people working on that but even with the people who have access
 they don't actually they did not actually being empowered by the technology that they have access to because of this missing piece of Education I think a lot about how I'm in the early days of this country we had a very well educated populace which was unusual as more people had more than in Europe so I read and with those words we created a country we created a democracy we created the expectation of how we would have individual rights
 now in this day and age we can exercise those individual rights and fundamentally different ways if we can access this technology that we can actually control it and actually create and I think that's that is the opportunity of an opportunity for participatory democracy in ways that never really been able to before because our ability to participate in our society physical capabilities are it is completely independent of The Superficial attributes of race and gender and age and all of these things so that's why I think everyone no matter what age they are right now what it was whatever they're station whatever there
 roles in society to be able to be actively creating on society and I think technology it thanks for an amazing conversation thank you for coming back on the show it's been really great having you and course you have any news or interesting things to discuss in the future the free to come back on it's been a pleasure having you on software engineering daily thank you

Transcription: building a software business today requires lots of decisions building software isn't just about choosing a programming language or a framework or a database software developers have to choose the right cloud service provider the best issue tracking service the best hosted code repository the clearest data visualization tools we need a platform to compare the options between different products all in one place in today's episode we talked to ion borrowing from siftery a platform for software products and the companies who use them trees mission is to help technologist find the best products for their job whether they are sysadmin or an advertising account manager my discussion with iron covers the question of build vs. buy and how to build a recommender system and how software it will be built in the future
this is also a great episode for anyone who is thinking of how to build a two-sided Marketplace business siftery after all is a business for software products and the companies who use them so it is ultimately two-sided Marketplace if you are a fan of software engineering daily tell us how to improve please fill out our listeners survey there's a link to the survey in our newsletter and at software engineering daily. Com we would love to know what you think we want to know what you want to hear more of what you want to hear less of we listen to all of the feedback that we get so please fill out the survey on software engineering daily.com or in our newsletter after a quick word from our sponsor we will get to this episode of software engineering daily siftery the platform for software products and the companies who use those software products
there are hundreds of tools for looking at user data Google analytics optimizely mixpanel customer. I owe all of these tools can be useful for figuring out how users are engaging with a product unfortunately many of these tools require you to write domain specific code in order to gather the data and set up your Integrations what if I told you that there is a product for reading code only once a single API a tool for unifying your data and Performing analytics on any platform for Marketo to MailChimp is that product segment simplifies your analytics so that you can collect customer data with one API and send it to any of hundreds of tools for analytics marketing and data warehousing with segment a developer can satisfy all the stakeholders at once from the data driven account manager to the app happy marketer to the data sign
who needs a data warehouse with a clean schema thanks to segment your CEO will fall in love with your newly efficient Integrations with tools like zendesk intercom and appnexus I'm falling in love with segment just talking about it thanks to segment for sponsoring software engineering daily if you are listening to software engineering daily and you have not tried segment give it a shot at segment.com and tweet at segment to let them know you heard about the product on software engineering daily we wouldn't be doing the show without the sponsors so thanks again two segments for sponsoring this show now let's get on with this episode
I am borrowing why is the CTO siftery a platform for software products and the companies who use them i n welcome to stop or engineering daily what is sifter
 sitting at Exit 3 we are trying to build the ultimate concrete product Ross which is basically the relationship of a buyer with on the dunes or software doctor with all the tools and services that you know they are working they're using at their work actually it's like a giant recognition systems more data you provide to Century we get better and understanding what your landscape is and we recommend software based on what he was stockings and watch your similar company stocks are Supras goal is to recommend the best software service for a particular scenario that a company might be in why is this useful to software Engineers so software engineer should I be like as a software engineer my shares right there's the landscape is humongous right we have a certain stock we have a certain preference everyday
 he has a certain preference of languages around application architecture it's important that you know we pick the right tunes and pick the right software on that looks like our dual 2in Shane or citrine Head Soccer Engineers to understand this off relax get better so we can understand who has blocked for me you know we can understand what exactly your stock looks like and then be Stern. So if you're in stock right we can understand okay then you probably should have should pick up a login framework which fits in naturally with you know every company probably that is using range so that that could have been around the entire Woods is a pretty interesting dynamic or notary software Engineers for everyone who's using software
 Shopper engineering has always had this debate of build vs. buy and 10 years ago the situation was often that if you bought software you were compromising you know you didn't get Optimum quality but it's saved you time and if you build your own software you would get better quality but it would take you months of extra developer time and now there is an ocean of high-quality software products that we can use as quick engineering building blocks and it's no longer just like Bill versus by it's like build vs. buy versus spy versus spy there's all these different products you can buy to solve any particular solution anybody got a problem what is your current perspective on how Engineers should approach the question of build vs. Buy
 I need you to look at sharks in January we need to get the market as soon as possible and with the highest quality possible so I can go Lake even even if you're building your building on top of existing open source of tension you're not really starting from scratch in all of us are standing on the shoulders of giants so we are pretty much all the time all the time it's not buy it because sometimes you're adopting actually not being dollars for gas too but we are actually you know our role in special in startups when when it comes to software engineer it's assimilation that you're doing right I was so it should I show people are searching all the time
 adoption of growing grounds up with search but you know which is like 5 minutes like anal life cycle of building sauce from scratch by season 3 to 4 months right and we we we do not go quietly eventually going to auction state which is like really really good State round search in like a couple of weeks right so to actual killing the market earlier is something that I did not start up as as in company for the perfect example in comparing the speed of getting on board without Golia versus rolling your own elasticsearch or something like that it's just sent you so much so much
 savings and that time Translate in Spanish
 I think we we put together pretty decent Rock range in team but you know the consensus is that like this school like to defecate search like this it will take a lot of time with you just need to finish this is where is just mind-blowing instructions on building on top of existing structure so easy right now it it makes two two Engineers can actually focus in the pool problem of energy of a business case in your you have a product idea
 we can focus on the corn and not worry about dinner we'll fill our website crash on the traffic because you know if you're an easy thing you can use to load balancer you can be in Creative Blaster you can you can have different type of you know dinosaurs like nasty gash RDS and you can mix and match and all of them seem to like stealing I we haven't scheduled yet to the point that we would like to what do you think you know much much calmer I think you don't like drama
 you know when you guys are non-stop product time to you got to the top and you got all this traffic because of it I'm sure but yeah I went through that day and there wasn't any traffic problems so did you hit any scalability issues that day like I was stating the logs and beware flying they were like Matrix the traffic was like I didn't because I was not on the other side of product and this was the first time I've seen this kind of a blue up happening I think we scared well because you know we kind of understood that the kind of product of the type of traffic but I can bring his like very very very fast in order for like crazy but everybody's eating in the website so I think we use a couple of understand like
 and then you know we'd be prepared Manatee rescue sites in nasty gash which is designed to read quickly and you know the half of 33. That is being constantly read these are the last Akash some of it is in postgres kind of design. We had that in mind that he wrote the conference's go to be walking down that's a nightmare situation right now that just gives moment we redesigned for it and showed that you know we can hang out of contents and I guess that it worked out fine for product
 is it right now I imagine you have so many fewer rights because in order to write you have to be a member at while you have 2 as I understand you have to be a member of a company that who that is displaying their stack on on slippery so like if I'm LinkedIn for example you know the only way if I'm an employee of the only way for the LinkedIn stock to be edited is by an employee of LinkedIn so you have a more right light. Offering right now did you expect you expect like as as this becomes more popular and you have a heavier right traffic you expect that to become more difficult to scale
 I don't think it's going to be that difficult unless we like I don't think we are going to hate. Lewandowski Liberty Shoes a time soon. Also means that you have to like
 if you look at if you look at a group right I don't know whether you've seen a group like me what we do with our group is we put together a bunch of companies write these companies should be any logical construct sleep together like a y combinator portfolio of unicorns or even when I'm at this is really dumb application around on the Rita that all the company has right so the reason you should eat with skating store you're hitting my girl you don't we are going to sleep right optimization Ski Liberty Shoes anytime soon like
 you know we received a lot of people were signing up and giving us data getting recommendations if you look at the lights are happening but it's not like they actually right you could just speak and say that I'm interested or I'm not interested or I'm too I'm just so easy these rights of a sucking let's put it that way but it's up to my website right now if you look at the wage design it's basically Geared for a gift to get money like you give the more you give the more you get all the websites of God who have a video through the change of structure around like if you look at a lot of review websites actually work for you
 soccer team today in changing structure in the universe like a Moto X you three would be it is basically to give first and then you know like having to ask what you do a bunch more effective viral Loop than the obvious than the opposite when when people think of software engineering they often think of someone writing lines and lines of code but software these days is composed of a lot of building blocks and you kind of touching this earlier it's like much easier to build software these days using music is building blocks in one example I think of this is is like a WordPress site that they even compose of a bunch of plugins that are created by people and you know if if I'm building a WordPress site I don't even need to understand PHP I can just put together these building blocks of plugins and I'm curious if that exists on a higher level if you see that on a higher level like it are there any company
 so you know of perhaps on shiftry that are able to build full-fledged software products by just gluing these different component pieces together without any internal technical specialist
 you should look at software engineering right I mean it's a spectrum it suspension from putting together a really simple tree websites know which is which which could be logged into a complex ecosystem like sequeira I think it is like if you look at the Spectrum right it just depends where your needs like in terms of what sort of cyst in your building right if you're building of a complex machine so your engine then obviously there's a lot lot more rounds of work that you need to do but if you're if you're on the other side where you are basically you know testing the market with a hypothesis right there you could probably have like a assimilation for WordPress and WordPress and then have me and Jimmy degraded to wear them then you just try to breathe
 I think it's respect room dividers and watch your use cases I'm sure that there's a lot of groundbreaking you know so the bottoms up word that is happening on in the EIC right now the machine learning I think you're just touching the tip of the iceberg hola hola and will require like in structure is just not read out there when you talk about the details malediction when you talk about complex question John data in building so I'm sure I'm sure that you can eat together with a bunch of students around the engine side of things
 also not of English language do you need to get paid ring going right you need to have like Bottoms Up thinking of the architecture how it pans out how it pans in the functional skill unless the product I guess you hate skin on history of thing through all these things there is this universe is trade-off between so I can not to sound too buzzworthy but I think there is an interesting trade off in the microservices
 versus monolith argument here because if you're if you're thinking of you've decided that you're going to be a company a software product that is going to scale you are absolutely if your heart set on scaling perhaps you should build microservices from day one but if you want to have this idea of you know I'm just going to build this thing together my throat over the wall and start getting customer engagement and expect to hit scalability problems then you know maybe your content to build a model with from from day one that's that's just a I just say that is as an interesting tension that I feel like we've we've covered on several episodes you know like you should if you're building microservices your building in a pr41 the engine side of things need to be talked to like you you can just like for example
 last night but I'm sure they had to think about scale from D12 because the beach is basically we will get you your results right sometimes our prayers are not fast enough to be doing a fabulous job there I think
 if you're if you're building a Michael show the show the work that you're very Jolie Brad irvan it is fabulous you know that's probably the way to go but there's always distention with Adrian and product and business shirt and Jean always needs more time had the V1 of the product and they presented it to bae's us and they're like so we've got eight of us version 1 what do you think and he's like well you know if this in the event that this actually works out it's going to fall over and it's not going to work so there are certain products where you can't just build a model with and throw it over the wall and hope for the best because if you lose trust that's your only life your dad know you know everybody is used to a facebook-like experience
 shopping right you like the consumer doesn't want to understand whether you are a 2000 member and dream team full of rock stars on US-1 right stuff without a Fastener be using this experience will review the end of the day you know you have to ensure that you don't you were a Chiefs meeting the Beast of going higher right we used to see that or that's what I'm saying that's just you bootstrap somebody is that I mean that's that's okay for a minimum viable product design on mobile is very different
 directions to New different
 your company has important projects that need to get done the IOS app needs to be Rewritten for Android the database needs to be migrated your continuous deployment system needs to be built the website need to complete redesign but you don't have enough software engineers and designers to get all this work done tough tile is here to save you talk to give you exclusive access to the top 3% of freelance Talent software engineers and designers from python to PHP top tell has the freelance Talent you need to get your project finished on time with top quality in the past we had to worry about flaky Freelancers with poor communication skills unreliable internet connections subpar technical skills show on top towel screens for these kinds of things and only works with seasoned professionals with tremendous problem solving skills personality and drive
 here's how it works top towels internal team of senior Engineers will work with you to understand your project scope and your talent needs and they will custom match you with just a few hand-picked candidates this means that whenever you need to add top-shelf talent for a critical project you can be connected with pre-screened Engineers were hand-picked for your needs and the results are impressive top top clients conduct just 1.7 interviews for every higher that they make all you need is to come ready with some decent technical specifications of your project and top towels team of Engineers will take care of you from there if you are looking to add critical Talent fast and you need a source you can trust go to top towel.com SE day you can also send me an email directly at software engineering daily at gmail.com and I will personally introduce you to the team at top towel so that you can learn more
 we live in unique times the nature of work is changing and more and more industry-leading companies from Airbnb to JPMorgan are realizing the benefits of scaling quick and staying flexible by working with Elite Freelancers so if you're short on resources for your projects check out top tile.com SE daily thanks to top tile for sponsoring the show now let's get on with this episode so you know we're talking about these these building blocks the software as a service building blocks that siftery is is kind of built to index there's a group of people in the software engineering community are open source fundamentalists and many of the types of software that someone might potentially purchase on a place like slippery like algolia pregnant is not open source
 right it's not in his it in your community or you think that it's counterproductive I don't need you I don't think I look at it. I think it's open source also right so I don't think we fundamentally distinguish between elasticsearch as an approach if you want to build search from ground job if that is a need that your product and you won't ruin Knox Ash and hibana with it right then and there any more points you want to keep search the way I know you would like
 researching and if it's quite a bit but issue looking at customizing into completely like I don't think you know if that's the case then you have to go to Jacob on juice you know using a bunch of people and I don't think we ever established
 open source I think open sores needs to like you know open source enough money or it's a lot of times it is music recognition and service contract but lost people are building a quality software and they're not making direct money market
 I don't know they make money you make money off of support but I forward like minions online software to make money somehow and it's not in support of the open-source discussion I think would be awesome if there were there was a tool that could granularly measure how different open pieces of Open Source software compare against one of the first I don't know this is really hard to reach there are numerous JavaScript Frameworks there are numerous streaming framers we've done about these big data does streaming framework samsa storm spark-streaming flu and flank and I can't wrap my mind around how to compare them
 the people who are building them have a great idea of what the pros and cons of each of them are do you think this is this is something that you would eventually want to build into shiftry like the ability to compare like the subtleties of of an open-source streaming framework building and we might not get it spot-on but it is needed in the sense that comparison today if you look at it or is it should be gone it cannot be based on all of you fix a damaged exchanges exchanges that option on exchanges to be home today.
 license or credential which is driven off context and that I have customers all the type of stock sort of guide what the other two should be and and that happened subconsciously like it or restart restart SodaStream work at certain language we have language preferences on people like Java some people like biking down the pipe to get to the Samsung comparison between DreamWorks
 are there so many continents in there so many factors right it's hard at times even for people who know their game it's hot legs you ask me I am do you want to go and get her Amber react I don't know I actually do know I'm tempted to try out everything and that is just not possible because every framework has its own set of ideology right once you start liking and Diving deep into something
 you will sort of start liking it so far do you think that this recommendation engine is going to be to build like do you think cuz like if I think about collaborative filtering for books or videos that I can understand how that would definitely be a highly functional great recommendation system but this is is Sardar software products a different category like are there too many dimensions of subtlety to build a recommendation I mean I'm sure that the answer is no because that's exactly what your building but maybe you could give me a better idea of how you would structure recommendation system tell me about the recommendation system
 that sucks right now we have to make Sans me muted a few products that I had high appearance riding out the data set is glued issued around holiday store hours every everybody's using Google on the first thing that will recommend you don't even understand what recommendation systems what what we are recommending two different users your damp and the world are taking effect of the presence of
 shut up should we started there I think we getting a lot of response and yes I would like to use this is this is also something like that so we we are trying to understand you know like what to be here it is right now there's a lot of people lot of users were seeing that yes I meant to say which means you're doing something right I'm going to Communications. In the moment somebody says I'm interested the moment somebody says that this doesn't make sense at all this right so you know it is basically is going to be very very hard
 sound machine learning Maryland understanding of how people think around software how they talk I think two years down the line our ignition system would be completely different you know we have way more Community data if you have little bit of subjected to you as well we can we can in to use auto mechanics around who's using what it's right now is just saying that I use this and I don't do this it could be I use this and I love it and I use this I probably told him and I I use this I want to change it so once you once we start quantizing you if you can give a quart it right now it's fine if you want to see you if you can break it down into a spectrum I think the recommendations are going to get better over time
 I actually do fundamental belief that we have is that beat we try to build on top of what we already have in stock exchange River honey badger davines login as a log into structure right in it it basically Spectrum login or whether these are right even doing right now we are considering if you should probably get the full version of it because now we've hit like we are Hitting Zone and see where you know it seems like having
 right kind of support bend around doing mechanic to install me the right way to go to Project the recommendation is really straightforward there's a really high probability of those will say yes and then there's this other percentage that is just like really really hard and it's really really difficult to figure out what dimensions you want to be considering like you know in the axis of you know when you're comparing streaming products are analytics products or JavaScript Frameworks maybe these kinds of cases will be really the last mile that will be really hard to solve but if you're doing something if you if you wanted to recommend a chat application to somebody that would be pretty straightforward these days you just say it you get Slack
 so just tell me some cases are very easy easy easy, so I just became the leader of region are we can bring that in tomorrow and I'll let you know what matters and what does adoption of roads are really complex that's why I'm in now
 company like that I need Seattle right there should be a little bit of human creation around we can have a cast shift Curry was actually a very useful tool because I was able to look at Siff Therese entire software-as-a-service tax I got to see you know the components that used to build shifter e and I know that you use AWS and this is probably getting into another one of these comparison discussions that is too difficult to Granny
 but why did you choose AWS over the other Cloud providers like Asher or digital ocean
 I know it's probably hard
 it's it's it's probably have it I'm sure that Noah's your is a fabulous Mac from it's just I guess that it's like Facebook you know you I'm just so comfortable because David really dming Adams didn't even realize what was happening I actually thought that you know that Microsoft and they have the best engineers in the words to I'm in the car is still there.
 how do you sweat at night I need to get this for me WS just to see Joyce which works better when you use AWS to what degree do you feel a sense of lock-in
 what works for you to log in I think we we have like I have personally as a CDO contemplated whether we should just get you a bunch of these sores and something like softlayer and being on software before they're fabulous like Rock Solid Silver Lake my mind when I when I'm bleeding a startup if it was a big company and Abby had sex. And we would think about devops from day one
 I disturb you I would consider it consider building our rules of attraction between afford to buy one for his Focus was basically just don't go on a Google product in US figuring out the core proposition around the product question I'm sure they're still there is if it's totally Pure Ice we need to look at when we might need to look at that picture again and then you might say that this is what we need to know what's it's like I would say that
 which rocks are brilliantly for me but as we scared we might need to go and own dissolution servers are actually service we just don't know yet you think there will be some sort of shift or technological breakthrough or allowance that will make pollution that lock and will make it easier for people to to treat treat server space is more of a commodity like you know maybe you could if you could use containers to you quickly container as your entire app and move it off of AWS a possibility I'm sure it's amazing that we from an engine Pope expecting I think
 I don't want to get too dependent on how much I like it's just practice to hit your back around and control so I think that is definitely true of Darker doesn't have much penetration yet I mean Silicon Valley and the other doctors right now it's a fabulous pieces product we we tried it out but University I was more would you rather mean I think I should be a stalker but yours and it has more and more penetration that it becomes like it becomes certified
 Mississippi or an interview how to make sure everybody knows it will just help in getting control back of your instructor you can be screensaver actually allow that it's distributed so some of them could be distribution server software could be Rackspace in which city
 but yeah. That's what's happening today in Benson Hall software has been built over the course in the same thing Steven any more time to penetrate every damn house possibly but the day is $0.08 dead insects so I might come up saying that I don't know Docker enough right I need to invest I'm there to understand the power of it I understand Chef better so let's just stick with Sharon and eventually go there right so that happening now I think within a few years
 talk to you tomorrow container I think they'll be more like school when she's there they might be another player so hopefully tomorrow meeting the huge rain has the most of these are startups a lot of Open Source software has gotten that
 is the tension between your aspiration as a starter trying to be a monopoly right and also you don't having make trouble consumer standpoint I think more options are better than healthy competition.
 Attention going on then
 yeah it's interesting so getting back to your software architecture so you know products like Facebook and Cora and Linkedin they need to build these complicated taxonomy is to represent the different entities that exist across these platforms for shifter E I still in his early days and you're building out the taxonomy to represent companies in a products how do you build a taxonomy that is Rich enough to represent the products and a company's on that platform but also flexible enough to support different taxonomic schemas in the future
 yeah I think I want to deal with me she could eat they randomly started working on it I will talk to you Muse really complex right as as engineer's you know we tried to register that I think you know we gone back and made it very simple if you look at the attic restructuring to lay right now I think
 we would like to keep it as loud as possible if you look at cool rides to really into reading your complexion touched them and I'm sure that the complex right but what do you want to do also is build a sort of a timing mechanism which is not really like in a tree structures would fit right in boxes versus Bieber's which is more and more you know more total fee showing in nudes right I can I can dog eat product into that you should go and sister you right now
 Acura technology or unicorn show the different so if you look at the relationship between a unicorn or in healthcare technology is not trying to be difficult taxonomy solar system make it still evolving but right now we're trying to keep it like less hierarchical more like son of open-ended so that we can do both like from the user's point of view it's totally flat if you tag something if you can a question as software engineering and software architecture for the user's point of view if there is no coupling between those two there's two different categories do you have to imagine on the backend there is some sort of hierarchy where those are connected but they can change and mix and matching
 doctor that however they want to and it's it's totally not exposed to the user
 yeah I think they always will have a much more the challenge of squirrels that would be nice is Ness structured right you can open up any topic today and it's difficult for diving is actually motivated today it's not right so I think for a system like Cortana or Google for that matter you Facebook or I think the truck in the real instruction for construction so I don't think we have to hire you know we didn't like I do know me direction. Robert Woodruff
 Jack agreed we probably will go there in terms of right now the categories are pretty broad right we can break it down further if you look at analytics like they could be so many types of so you can feel God log streaming there could be so many times so I think rather than putting it in terms of sub categories and subcategories in Sub Sub sub categories I think we can we can do a Taxidermy which is more user juven which is like you know like disciples this type of product is being used by people who bought right so I will be like on at Lake something like that.
 dr. Taxidermies not State band into the rec Recreation we want to do that show me different directions you could go in but I imagine you are holding your focus in on on one or two product initiatives what are you looking at the most I think the primary focus 16 ways to build a very good you know and Rich Product Company drops which nations that's the only good I think we've stayed away from putting coconut sugar content in Stella beer from reviews you stay there with the rest of the world is spinning I think a lot of emails have come to me because like you don't know
 how did you resist the comments the comments you know that I interest credit card not why are you not doing two things reaction used to go on his sexual content and cut it is not counting into tears because it's not working right knee should we were not sure whether you work or not 2012 you doesn't make sense anymore it's 2016 so constantly around someone giving us we try to stay away from it I don't show
 the other other thing that we did was you had a very Lively field website to see product so we had to shut off
 I mean we were you consciously trying to keep it very young and Alive Living Color's your way it is almost like this product with you enjoyed Speedway right is not supposed to be this lightly at times. That's also something that we like the Predator old Mesquite to be want to build a no best sort of warranty company graph and we will probably Focus your energies there and not getting to the Temptations
 we don't want to do that you don't want to do that because then the buyer will lose faith in us that you know you are shopping us around so even though so we stayed active decision on Sue and you stayed and we are going to stay away from the Temptation you can quickly make a lot of money on the vendors vendors want to spend you know their marketing dollars on platforms where buyers are hanging out tonight so we have basically this is from which is geared towards buyers and we will do everything that is in our capacity to get the body experience right right now we are just drink selection it doesn't have to be it doesn't have to stop there you could be usage also
 how much are you spending how much should you spend what is your quarterly spend on your scene Sue's right maybe you're spending like 200% more rides Northern Alex can come from the black phone and I think I would go with 2016 Beyond goal will be to do everything in a capacity to help out the buyers you know we do this word abundance of softwares only mention this blog stop rinsing daily spin a fascinating conversation and I am a huge fan and a user of siftery so I look forward to the future product iterations for having me in

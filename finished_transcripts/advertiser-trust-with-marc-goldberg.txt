Transcription: despite all the problems with online advertising ads are not going away advertising is fundamental to the modern internet economy in previous episodes of software engineering daily we have mostly dissected the problems of adtech bots tracking fraud brand safety we talked about some solutions for example JavaScript tags that you could put on a page to identify a bot before you serve it an ad but these Solutions don't get the job done completely because it isn't possible to reliably identify Bots today we explore another solution for ad-tech the whitelist Mark Goldberg is the CEO of trust metrics a company that provides white listing for advertisers a whitelist is a list of domains that are acceptable to run your advertisements on
in order to build a whitelist you need to review thousands of sites to judge which ones are reasonable places to publish an advertisement Mark joins the show to describe how to build and scale system for reviewing websites and judging whether they are safe to run ads against if you like this episode we've done other shows about advertising fraud download the software engineering daily app for iOS or Android and hear all of our old episodes easily discovered new topics that might interest you and if you don't like this episode you can find something much more interesting by looking at a recommendation system in the app the mobile apps are open sourced at github.com software engineering daily and if you're looking for an open source project to hack on we would love to get your help the software engineer daily open source Community is building a new way to consume software engineer and content and we have an Android app on IOS app recommendation system and a web

 Mark Goldberg is the CEO of trust metrics Mark welcome to software engineering daily thank you for having me excited today we're going to talk about advertising fraud and the problems that causes and some potential Solutions and you have been in the Internet space for pretty long time you've worked at a variety of different companies kind of in publishing and add sales what do you give a bit of a description for how you have seen the evolution of online advertising from your point of view
 sure so I I grew up on the agencies buying media and I was pretty frustrated watching you know my TV dollars gets spent on commercials that were never seen because people want to go to the bathroom or go by make popcorn and went online advertising came up to to play I really got excited because you know the impression loaded and and the user song so that that by concept I thought that was wonderful and so you know I started on the more less the ad Network side into the publisher side and then I then I started to realize maybe you know the publishing what else going to be doing and I start learning about the ad Tech side and and I've been here for her for a couple years now
 and it can you just give a brief description for the the companies that you worked at and how they interface with the advertising ecosystem sure so I send it to me D & J Walter Thompson and then I went in to look at you at agencies I went to a rep firm called face to Media that's no longer in existence that was around 2000 and then I put my head down at about.com for over 10 years and I experienced a lot of different aspects of that step business I hope the sales team sell more effectively I helped by and acquire companies and when you start getting the attico system I was really at the beginning one of the first beta partners of Google's at exchange and I was really thought of that that are size in our world as the guy who kind of handled all the networking at exchange business so I started that side pretty early that was probably oh 40506 I would say and then you know I went to different Publishers and had different experiences
 the ad ecosystem and now I trust metrics I'm I have a very different relationship with the audio system I'm kind of sitting back watching it and trying to help fix it to be honest, where you spent a decade of the longest position of your career so far that was an early collection of Publishers is that correct it was it was like a different different web sites different media properties that people went to to do various things on the internet model we basically created a platform for individual verticals to to to live and grow are you found experts to write content and this is at the beginning where we thought you know everything you need to know about dogs was not only written by one person but it was also a collection of sending people in the right direction to make sure they can understand everything you need to know about dogs so we did each individual topic so dogs out about. Com cats. About.com you know to fibromyalgia. About.com each one
 add individual topic so it was great for contextual advertising whether it was Google's advertisements or even Big Brand trying to come and buy and acquire a lot of inventory a lot of eyeballs in an inverter about.com was originally owned by Prime media the New York Times and now I see I see I want it today it's actually done through a major rebranding I can't even remember what the name of the company now but it's a different different brand and no longer really exist but back then when you were an early publisher with a lot of volume and you integrated with some of the earliest advertising exchanges did you start to get a vision for for some of the advertising fraud it was fraud taking place back in those days in the early days of exchange integration oh for sure I mean it's funny because the first so I was very much a believer in one
 add exchange because if you could kind of control the supply and understand and put your supply in one place then the market economics would kind of did that the bid economy would would flourish in other words the rates will go up because it would need to find your inventory where it where it was and other Attic Angel come to me saying stop using Google use mine weather was Rubicon add milk when they were part of when that are Google all those guys are coming to my office and try to catch me and then people start say hey I see your inventory here I didn't understand why my inventory was somewhere else and it turns out there was a stupid going on or add injection services so add injections a form of fraud where it's a downloadable product on someone's device or someone's computer that's injecting ads into a publisher page and you can go to the New York Times Are you can go to YouTube and you would see a couple add units but now all the sudden there's like six add units and it and decide units are or all over the place but it's at 8.
 ads were coming from an injector which is a form of fraud because this publisher never wanted these ads on the page and so does my first introduction and I started to figure out all my gosh look at all of these different things going on people are buying traffic people are selling traffic for for sub Penny how they doing that and you start to really understand that there's this whole underbelly of the ad ecosystem I think what we read and some of the the big Publications you know that's just the surface level there's a complete underbelly you can go find on Reddit what what's really going on you can go find if you type in a certain keywords in Google or LinkedIn where to find all the bad guys in plain sight what do you say what's really going on and you're refer to the bad guys what are you referring to their sure so a lot of people think they bought that operators and these big fraud organizations are coming from China Russia and India and there's these big farms and certain people in rooms there is some truth
 however you can go next door and see your neighbor in their basement doing things the bad guys and when I say bad guys are the people who are creating but you can go in to read it and see that these this is a great example on Reddit I found someone else to share it with me a web page that I read it where someone was asking the question how do I get a new router because my router is burnt out because the 60 phones I have in my house till you to utilize for my for my traffic farming it there and it's burning my router
 well wait a minute you who someone is doing this who's doing answer is perfect English I mean it's not like it's coming from another country this is it this is a US citizen probably again next door to you that's kind of the real oh boy moment where it's not just non-us citizens in large organizations are quote unquote criminal organizations that is happening however there's a completely different side of this where it is actually you know people doing things here and we can get in the fake news later I know but like the Macedonian teenagers is the big article from BuzzFeed they do a great job and take me to
 but there's also the guy in Colorado and I cannot remember his name but he was on 60 Minutes he's at home waiting 50 fake news sites like it's it's here the Denver Guardian yes exactly and so so this is not just limited to the bad guys in terms of criminal organizations or or non US citizens there are people who just don't have the right intent and is sometime during the election or shortly after the election this guy who have been writing fake news from Colorado with a website that sounded real the Denver Guardian he was writing a fake news just to get traffic to come to a site to get ad Revenue it wasn't about propaganda it wasn't about doing an election in One Direction or another not to say that those things are impossible or even improbable but the reality is that it doesn't even have to be that complicated fake news
 can be motivated simply by money absolutely in so you know I am in a lot of conversations around his fake news political words that fraud and it's both because there are is some political Espionage going on and and I don't want to get into that side of the world but there is just really at the end of the day a form of Faith publishing and when I say faith publishing you can create a food site with recipes that you copy and paste and try to try to get into the search engines to Rank 2 then you know creating a celebrity site and trying to get into the social media all fake news is really you know trying to get a headline to get someone to click on to get a user to enter into that ecosystem and Anna and we're going really fast here but let's just take that for a second and say why do they want traffic to go a dollars why do they need the humans is actually very important because when they send a hundred percent body activity these sites they get caught by the detection Services if they can mask and I think you've heard from Shaolin and others that have been on the
 program if they can say that some humans are going here the sampling of the detection Services gets tricked try to make it as this traffic laundry traffic laundering basically you just need some minimum amount of human traffic in order to dupe the bot detection techniques the naive bot detection techniques because if let's say 15% of your traffic is is legitimate and then the other 85% is Bots well they can't just Blacklist the site from displaying ads because there's a lot of legitimate traffic going there so you know it's kind of the only question is how much and I exchanged messages occasionally I remember a while ago I was on the internet I was just browsing Twitter I saw some retweet from some account for some reason I was just like something about this account looks weird likes different types
 watch so often at this point like I when I see an account I can sometimes just tell the way that this account is tweeting it is automated always curious when you see an account that you could tell it's automated by looking at it by looking at the way that the tweet that goes out but you look at that the account profile in like what the human right there because it look this is a human is a picture of a human he's carrying his kids and he's got me know nice picture of his dog as his new profile background picture and you know it looks like you know Todd Todd schmertz touchmark holder you know like journalist your tech journalist and he's got like an about. Me profile he's got a LinkedIn profile like you drill into his Twitter account you look at all these different profiles and I call this guy is a really well developed fake account and then you look at that the site that he always publishes to his disciples just like complete garbage like quote on quote
 Zyrtec news or reviews of a movie or some garbage site like that and there's ads all over the site and it's something that no human would ever consumed and yet there's ads for Volvo and wonder where the Wonder Woman movie playing on this website and the depth and sophistication of these botnets and these fake traffic schemes these fake new scheme I mean from my point of view I'm not hurt by it so it's kind of hilarious to me and I enjoy reporting on it what causes serious harm to the internet and the flow of information
 oh no question I mean you know I I kind of laughed because these profiles me start digging into it sometimes you think this is just actually looks like it could be real because a lot of the bad guys are going at that at Great Lengths to develop these profiles and you know I found one recently where the same comment was it was so there was a comment on a on a big I think it was Donald Trump Facebook page and you copy and paste a comment you can find it on 6 different places and when you take that comment you look at the different profiles all they're doing is creating these profiles to make comments to make a fake news site look a little bit more Wrecking Ball so they're going a Great Lengths to develop the profiles whether it's in LinkedIn Facebook or Twitter they're going a Great Lengths to make these profiles look as real as possible because again they wanted to text you know by pasta the the other services to make sure that you know when someone's looking this looks legit
 who do you use for log management I want to tell you about scalar the first purpose-built log management tool on the market most tools on the market utilize text indexing search and this is great for indexing a book for example what do you want to search logs at scale fast it breaks down scaler built their own database from scratch and the system is fast most of the searches take less than a second infected 99% of the queries execute in less than a second that's why companies like OkCupid and giphy and Careerbuilder use scalar to build their log Management Systems you can try it today free for 90 days if you go to the promo URL which is software engineering daily.com scalar s c a l l y r
 that's software engineering daily. Com scalar scalar was built by one of the founders of rightly which is the company that became Google Docs and if you know anything about Google Docs history it was quite transformational when the product came out is this was a consumer-grade UI product that solve mini distributed systems problems and had great skill ability which is why it turned into Google Docs and so the founder of Riley is now turning his Focus to log management and it has the consumer-grade you why it has the skill ability that you would expect from somebody who built Google Docs and you can use scalar to monitor key metrics you can use it to trigger alerts immigration with pagerduty and it's really easy to use it's really lightning fast and you can get a free 90-day trial by signing up at software engineering daily.
 / S C A L yr software engineering daily. Com scalar and I really recommend trying it out I've heard from multiple companies on the show that they use scalar and it's been a real differentiator for them so check out scalar and thanks to scale for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily
 now we here that all of the advertising revenue is now going to funnel at funneling into Google and Facebook give any idea like how much of the advertising deal flow is still subject to these kites kinds of random sites that are maybe maybe out of the way I say going into Google or Facebook 7 I think that 75% is search search advertising of five percent of Google's advertising a search 25% is the Display Network so I guess that 25% of that could be subject to these fake sites I'm not sure how much Facebook does display advertising outside of the Facebook Walled Garden but I think we're talking about these fake journalism sites that are just generated content these are typically ad networks that are outside of the Facebook in Google ecosystem is that accurate
 I think you're very very accurate right now in that Google and Facebook are dominating most of the display dollars I think Amazon has created a new third player it does have its issues but I think Facebook and Google are the real two dominant ones and everyone is just kind of feeding off the rest and the rest is still big.. That's that's something that I think people don't understand it's the rest is still big is it big enough long-term to scale for everybody well right now I think we're looking at these it's duopoly at the end of the day with Google and Facebook dominating in and no signs of like getting weaker unfortunately the fraud hits them too they're just much better at it at protecting because they have enough resources to look through it and I think Google learn very early in the CPC model that if you make advertisers Happy by giving them good performance they will pay me and in the CPC model when you pet people would pay higher and higher for good quality clicks you will pay a higher and higher for Quality inventory and I think Google got that right the first iteration and now with this play I
 I think they're starting to see a little bit of headaches with with video and because of just YouTube so massive people come there and it's a Target now but I think Google has done a very good job they are not immune and no one is perfect at preventing 100% of fraud so we know Google and Facebook are are obviously too huge entities that have a lot of unique users and provide a lot of great options for advertisers but they're not the only options I think what I am I hope happens is that you know advertising inventory starts to clean up and everyone will start to see where the quality is and hopefully people will start paying Publishers for higher-quality because it will do more and better performance-wise the amount of a dollar
 in dis in online advertising versus a television online advertising just passed the dollar spend in television was it last year is that accurate I don't think I've heard that number I know it's growing I know it's important I don't know if it's cross cross that big number wow... If that's true wow but I'm a little concerned and you can talk about you know the Procter & Gamble's pulling out of digital and a lot of the news around fraud in a lot of the news around you know brand safety people are getting scared and what I'm trying to do is make sure they're not scared as buyers they want to go into the marketplace knowledge understanding what's good what's bad and being able to buy with a lot more intelligence because when you do find humans and good environment it should work it will work and it's exactly what you want to do because if you and I I have kids that all they do is look at these phones or are there online and I know you know a lot of behavior
 trying to change you're not watching TV you're watching Netflix or Amazon or Hulu and so a lot of the stuff is moving away from from from television still great platform don't get me wrong but digital is a very very real thing and I don't see it going away or but I do see it getting more but being bought more intelligently and when I say that is having multiple kti's applying best practices there are things that we need to do in digital that have not been done and we need a hard reset to do and I don't want people to run away from it I want people to stop breathe think by right and so will get into some of the prevention techniques including what you're doing with trust metrics you pointed out the Procter & Gamble example I think that was something like I was there also a group I think it was another big one right or so and then
 Ace is the other brand probably that was in the New York Times they they they basically came out and said that you know we're not buying the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Maine's anymore with work we're focusing a lot smaller and I think a couple other brands of come out via the A&A studies about you know standing a little tighter and tougher when did with their digital dollars it happening I'm just a little concerned that were all going to do it and pull out digital that's not the right strategy that is the absolutely did not write strategy I'm not saying give it all to Facebook or Google not saying you know pull out and get the TV I'm saying think about the original intent caveat these episodes where I'm diving deep into fraud I'm not throwing I'm not trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater advertising obviously works and that's why they're what that's why Google and Facebook has been able to
 their business is off of it that's why people have been building it resolved advertising for a really long time and by building a business advertising I'm not just saying building an advertising company and pick my people that have made great advertising and that has led to sales of their product that's a beautiful part of business and that should be maintained but you know obviously if you know what companies are in the Procter & Gamble example was like they pulled out almost the pulled out like all but 5% of their digital Aspen or something crazy like that and then noticed no change in sales they did all the base of a very significant a B test and they noticed zero change in sale so I mean honestly speaking part of that could be because you know maybe they've got outdated ad copy or you know that it's even worse when I see it even when I see a display ad from something is Procter & Gamble product and probably have ADD blindness to it and I think even even like I can't think of
 I can't imagine somebody in my life who does not have ADD blindness to that kind of thing so you know maybe some of it is the creative maybe some of it is the quality of the ads they beat the context but we can throw the baby out with the bathwater soap how are brands in agencies discussing fraud these days how does it does it. How does it factor into their conversations these days how is changing their buying patterns and you know how was it changing their choices in Technology Solutions a great question I think those are the questions that are being talked about a lot more today then I go back to the TV example where the add went where you left the room and the the ad Randy didn't pay for it and then you know you should have any relationship with an espn.com or New York Times you get soul of sponsorship in your banners on the below the fold but they priced it for you that way once programmatic came into the conversation those banners below the fold we're getting a loaded and when they continue to get low
 did they would be you know bid on in the prophetic changes with a cookie attached to its would have more value so Publishers for a while we're making a couple more dollars and they probably should have and then the agencies and never said we will what's going on why is this happening that ad was interviewed well I'm not paying for it and so now this new terms utility comes into the conversation now they only want to pay for viewability so that started the conversation and then they did then then people start to argue about what field what's not and I don't want to debate that that's what the IP which is the Internet advertising Bureau in the MRC establish as bad as the standards but those conversation led into will what's happening with you be able why isn't it feel well and then it became well that's not a human weight is that a human and they started realizing more and more oh we have brought and it comes out we have fraud there is no fault to the agencies and I wish people would understand this that they didn't know
 because quite frankly a lot of people to know how bad it was but now that the knowledge is starting to get understood you have to select vendors and and I think you know what I think you've had doctor Foo on before and you had Shaolin on before and you got some other people from method you know this is a very complex stuff even the good guys like us don't know everything but we do know is that no one's perfect and I think agencies look at the space as okay there has to be one vendor that can do this and they had a check the milk boxes let's choose them and I think they have this comfort in this check boss mentality where we don't want to pay for something that's not actually media so let's just say this is working and if it's working then we're fine and I think it's becoming more and more clear to a lot of advertisers that not one approaches working we have to be very careful of just saying that something's working or not working it's not absolute and that's where I see the bigger problem about to happen is that
 all the detection services are trying to do a good job and you know when you're in the detection service like a security like a purse keys or or any of those other guys that have you know that that that world than that where they're at every day fighting the fight the bad guys are always going to be trying and always trying to be better than the good guys and and now we're in the Jackson service the same things happening people are reverse engineering the good people are tricking the good guys and so if you only have one good guy looking at it while there's a good possibility that they're getting tricked by some way so if you have multiple approach
 you may be a bit better off and so I think the conversation that's been happening with the the agency's is if they're smart agencies are starting to tell that Brands listen you have to have multiple kti's is not just about we ask for a guarantee we're running into a big risk we are going to ask for a guarantee we're not going to choose vendors that say they have a guarantee of a hundred percent of your ability or hunt percent free we're going to expect it
 and so with the buying power you can actually change the conversation and I think advertisers need to set the tone agencies there's a question how much incentive they have to make this go away but but if you're a good agency and you're doing right by your client you don't have to pitch a nut that same client that the same business you're running you're going to make take the measures that you need to take the agency discussion I think is a little bit interesting just because he always said about that the misaligned incentives so you know a giant company like a four-door Procter & Gamble that does brand advertising that is advertising where you're not measuring the at you can't really measure the into end funnel very well all you can measure is that we are getting this in front of people or if we are getting it we are buying impressions in those are being displayed to a person or a bot you know end and people are having their psychology changed over time to be convinced afford be convinced of Dove soap or be convinced of Coca-Cola over
 Pepsi that is brand advertising and large brand advertising purchase often take place through an agency a brand like Coca-Cola goes to a giant agency or 5 giant agencies and purchases their ads through the agency and the agency's performance is not benchmarked in a way that is like makes them beholden off in time to really good quality so you know Coca-Cola pays the agency x million dollars and the agency is just going to go out and buy the cheapest traffic that they go to cheapest said the impression that they can in some scenarios of course there are agencies that do right by their customers but the you know it as as you are saying here there's a question of misaligned incentives and that's problematic because a lot of this display advertising on non Walled Garden environments that are not like non-facebook non-google environments those are display brand advertising their own
 so it's just it's just a problematic relationship and it and you know unless the brand start in housing a lot of their advise then it's you know maybe it's not going to go away at the best of the agency that there are very few people on the planet that can bring it in the house that have they upscale and need for it for programmatic agencies are necessary and I think what they the buyer the the clients need to do is really set the standards and set the tone early and often and it be accepting of some of the things that have gone wrong in the past to fix if you are asking for a hundred percent the ability to your agency or agencies going to turn around by the worst sites on the internet
 yeah that's what they're going to do so he know the great example I like to go to take news fake news it's cortical brand-safe there is no swear words are pornography so the detection Services saying that's good it's beautiful there's 10 ads above the fold it's viewable and it's human because your your uncle on your mom's side is is posting it and you're gullible enough to click on it and all the sudden you're there that's human so fake news is actually based on a client's thought process is perfect for them but once they have that conversation with the New York Times Reporter another reporter and and they start thinking about the ramifications of fake news and then they start getting better understanding about brand safety and how it does matter because I think what's happening is more people are starting to understand that context does matter because for the last couple years we've been told it's about audience buying and finding the Right audience pocket I think there's a combination of both that win the long term but
 that's that's my view

 as we Seidel towards a discussion of the prevention techniques that can actually work here you know you mentioned need multiple techniques in order to effectively combat fraud you can't just have a single bot detection provider and in a part of the reason for that is just because I mean I've asked several of the body at 3 I think three or four of the main body detection companies I've asked them you know it tell me how can you define the difference between a bot in the human and they they cannot they cannot tell me in so I'm like okay so how can you say with confidence that you are catching X percent of Bot traffic you know you're catching 99% of Bot traffic okay if you can Define that metric you sure as hell be able better be able to Define what is a bot and what is a human and they can't say that to me because like there are crawlers there are
 there are replay attacks you can replay human behavior you can build a machine learning model that replace human behavior and that's a bought and it looks like a human and you can't tell me that you're detecting all of that that's not to say that we should you know throw these bot detection providers under the bus but I think that they would do well to adopt a little bit more humility and perhaps a bit a bit more realism of course maybe that doesn't sell as well but anyway you want to use by detection providers why not might as well and you want to use other techniques and so that's why I I want to get into discussing trust metrics which is your solution D white listing of domains the first of all I guess before we even get into to that maybe you could Define why why you need why I like the bot detection filters like if you would you put a plow on JavaScript on your website and every user the hits your website gets filtered against that JavaScript blob
 which is it which represents a model that determines whether you're a human or a bot explain why that is not good enough in terms of fraud prevention people using it in Banner it's they're using a pre-bid and there's a variety of sampling issues that come with that there's a variety of ways that the bad guys know what you're doing and so they can protect it and so you know when you start looking at the that the better ways I would say actually put in code on that your publisher page it is a good way but but buying programmatically you eat that means all the Publishers you're buying have to have that code that's just not realistic in a New York Times whatever you're going to subscribe to the fact that you want to put this code on the page with her to ads. Txt Pro initiative by a bee or or some other program to help you understand what you mean you're not human but the pro
 home is actually when people are buying you programmatically they don't care they don't they don't they don't see that code on the page or knows you're human or Not Human they need to understand what's going on you know 7000 other websites so you know that there's a little bit of a problem where it's you know what when you're when you're a Direct Buy that's a good thing to have and yet has an agency you want to do business with ESPN that's that's great I love that you want to do that however you also want to buy the other sites via the other DSP mentality one of the things I wanted sure I say is you know each site has about activity and you touched on it there are good Bunch Google that's about right I mean there are goodbye it's so that there are some bud activity on the New York Times ESPN and if you did by traffic to support a campaign they're actually might be more because that's where a lot of the bad for what happened however if you have a direct relationship with ESPN and all the sudden you cspn fraud levels go from 4%
 explicit might be acceptable to 15 to 17% which might not be acceptable you know who you call ESPN you don't have that opportunity to call craptacular blog one craptacular blog to craft a killer bomb fake news 3 and I think that's the difference is you can hold ESPN accountable and you can hold big Brands accountable and therefore I think if we do this right the brands that we know and maybe love will be better off in the long term because they know the risk as you talk about growing a business they know the risk of losing you know for quite a revenue they know the risk of not having that Advertiser that was there last year they know the rest in bot world in the fake world the site that's here today when it gets blacklisted or found out or not seeing Revenue it's gone tomorrow they just turned it off so you can look at some of these fake news sites that that that were famous during you know the election cycle and go to those domains today they're not there anymore
 and until I like to say is you know it they're here today gone tomorrow but they weren't on your whitelist reply when they weren't on your block list yesterday because you didn't even know about it and now that you know about it it's gone so so that there is that problem with white listing of blacklisting in that you have to know it end and what we're saying trust metrics and maybe this is a Segway I think you're here you want me to do but I trust metrics we're scanning domains and apps for Quality safety and brought signals and what we're doing is we're doing this with both machine crawl as well as human review the machine will calls are going to Paige's human looks at certain ages but it's a combination of both of them with the feedback back to the machines to continue to look for things that allow us to understand what a side is where it belongs in terms of a taxonomy what type of score to get in terms of quality there are a lot of things that go into our school and you're focused on whitelisting because you get taken by Hillary Clinton is a lizard.

 for you know 50 million impressions and then by the time you realize it it's too late you've already lost you know you already spent money on those Impressions so that the whitelist is basically the idea of what's just assume that most of the internet is not worth this playing ads against or running ads against you only want to you know a sign adds to the specific list this white list of of domains yes and I would say it a little differently in that not all brands have the same thresholds or criteria of what qualities should a man so you know in terms of brand safety you know there are some brands that are sensitive for a variety of reasons whether their CEO is as always concerned about you know whether it's gender alcohol or or some other reason to then
 legal bike Pharma and finance there's a legal risks to running on into certain types of sites so brand safety there's a spectrum here where maybe someone doesn't want to be seen two political whether it's right or left or seen in news at this point you know that there's deltas and then travel partners of the world where there's a plane crash they want all their ads away from it so there's a lot of issues around brand safety that you know all the sudden become a byproduct of or talking about airlines are great example they want to be away from things like like fret bike crashes so it's so they wanted at that moment each brand has different criteria and so all we're saying is let us know your criteria and we will build a list that is representative of you brand Advertiser so we're not handing the same sites to the same all the different people we're not defining the atom ecosystem with our our database we're defining your ad ecosystem and how we're doing this is we're not scanning the web for not putting a crawler up in Sango fine
 everything on the web for not getting getting Wikipedia Pages we get submissions from ad networks that exchanges advertisers of domains to Total look through and so we're really only looking at the ad ecosystem we have over we have over all over or close to a million domains in our database and we have scores in all of them and when an Advertiser comes to us if it's if it's there working with a DSP we would help build a list based on their grade two criteria if they're working with an ad Network who prepares their own inventory the network of submit their lists we would then scrub their list based on our database and their criteria and figure out which sites are acceptable to run on sorry so the the brand or the DSP comes to you with their list of domains that they could potentially run add inventory on and they check it against your database yes weekly check it against the database based on the
 find specific criteria so in other words if credit card brand doesn't want you know anime dating politics we end they want equality threshold of X and I don't get too detailed about what what quality means in in this conversation but did they set the criteria we then look at our database build a list for the DS be added to the network comes to us we then scrub it against that criteria give it back to them and say you can only run this and DSP you can run on that that's it was that demands demand-side platform I think yes sorry I should have done that of demand so basically what is it they would sit on the top and then basically all your cookies and all of your bid strategies live in the DSP in the DSP is looking into the SSP which is supply-side
 so they're looking into the supply side looking for the inventory what we're saying is take these 10,000 sites and only go into the supply-side looking for these ten thousand Saints okay so just to clarify little bit more said that before before they before the DSP engages with trust metrics they have a very long list of places that they are buying inventory and then they say to trust metrics hey you know we we want to impose some certain criteria against our current List of Demands that were buying from help us impose that criteria and that's what trust metrics does yes but I would say it's the DSP in the networks are not coming to us it's the agencies and advertisers that we have the relationships with so it's the advertiser is so the agencies are representing a client and that client has very specific guidelines and we help Implement those guidelines for all their media Buys so I think it was as a planning tool
 where on the buy side helping the buy-side engage is supply-side so the supplies are at the GSP still in this scenario we're helping the brand side that the clients and agencies interact with the network Cindy ESPYs and by programmatic media at scale with confidence and when I say I'm scale going back to the agency's you know agencies one if they believe in the whitelist they want to create their own or they they they they figured it out and Endive time and time again work with agencies that sell yeah we we spent four days this week until 10:30 and we have this white list of 26000 2600 sites
 and I'll look at that list and I'll say great and give it to me and I scrub it and I look at it and well actually based on your criteria these 500 are not where you want to be and oh by the way we can get you to 9000 sites if we were to import have put this criteria into our database here are the sites you run out of this is acceptable oh yeah let's do that instead and show all the sudden you know what we're doing is wearing extension of the agency and Advertiser where it were part of their team and I think where we found a real real nice part of it is in that planning stage because agencies in advertisers are against each other in this win in and it these days because of Fraud and utility in a lot of these other transparency issues where their bidding for the business and not allocating enough staff to do the work that's become so necessary and don't have enough staff to do the work because their bidding for the to win the business
 NFL stats are jobs become super technical overtime right and they're just like they're out stripped in terms of training and there's very few people went into advertising and I'm one of them I got it started and advertising that that had any intent of and any idea that this was going to be so technical there marketers a lot of them are very smart strategic thinkers but then when you start getting into the weeds it comes up very technical business and there are some great people on the agency side no doubt but then there's a long road ahead for some as well and some agencies are are clearly not up to speed some agencies are are talking to brands that are not up to speed and Brands only have to answer to their CFO who just wants to know a number and the number is lower that's what they want to bid that's what they want to see p.m. they want to spend lower and so there's this Clash monks agencies I want to go back to the agency client Behavior too much but I think what's happening is
 is agencies are are getting crushed by the brands because of the news that's out Asia getting crushed because of CFO the saying why we spending all this money we don't want to an agency and client was sitting there like a digital is the future we have to and so there's this huge problem and circle that's not going away and you know I think in terms of what trust metrics roll is is to clean up the app ecosystem and and help me that extension of the team by by providing value on stuff that they can't do themselves and they say the CFO of the brand says why are we spending so much money with you when there's all this risk of Fraud and whatnot and the agency comes back to them and and says oh okay well actually we're going to use trust metrics now and we're going to increase our quality that we display ads on and that's going to help things it's is that the way the conversation goes where where the agency kind of says
 I need to add this other line item and then you're going to have better results are going to better brand safety like pink describe look a little bit more how how you slotted yourself into honesty part of this is is is that working on advertising company right now and I'm just curious about how you slot yourself in as a line item let me know this movie is a personal question for offline but strategically in this extremely complex Marketplace how you actually become a line item in the purchasing process yeah I know I mean that that's been kind of the challenge for us as we are part of that planning layer and they think you know it well this is non-working media cause I don't want to spend down and I am done I'm tired of the nonworking me they cost and what I would do I keep telling people is if you if you are just dismissing non-working media your media won't be working and I think that's become very clear with more and more of these and a studies that fraud is not going away there's a lot of problems in the Eddie Coast
 Samsung cell if you continue to dismiss all these non-working media cost you're just getting money or other basically add infrastructure companies add me add you a lot of XP can I apologize buddy the non-working media falls into ad-serving falls into brand safety files into verification viewability falls into ad creative and so you know most of these costs are continuing to rise because if you're doing media effectively you're utilizing Goodrich media video You're utilizing some cookies and targeting I forgot to add that to your ear utilizing you know hey let's track it make sure this address of you there's a lot of things going in and there's a lot of different charts out there they will say x percent is going to non-working media and it just irks the cfo's why are we doing this and I completely understand but if they understood what's going on are busy
 I think the agency's need to do a much better job at communicating this is if you don't spend in this non-working media let's not even bother with digital because you're just throwing your money away and that's where I think you know we we are in the marketplace a lot with education and talking a lot about this hour of you is you need us and another security vendor and the reason is we're going to make that other security with Ender work even better because we're going to remove a lot of the sites that are causing them the headaches when we look at a site where looking in this also would humans and I can you can see and maybe you don't even know anything about digital you can see that there's no way 400 million people are going to The Cider 40 million people are going to the site but if you look at the Impressions you can see someone said that this site had this many Vue reviews are Impressions there a lot of traps and what we're saying is if you can if you can detect some of the bad guy sites with eyes and you remove them they're going to cause less Havoc to the other vendors and that's where I think
 ice plus another vendor helps and then when you asked the question around you know what what's a good way to you know prevent us plus another vendor Sowell whitelist plus another vendor I believe is is a good long-term future this doesn't give you hundred percent confidence but I think at the end of the day it's close enough water with another vendor be like a w bot detection company section service like another security Vendor by so is integrilin times I will verify white Ops mote there's three or four of these guys that are that are in in in in the space that are good but you know unfortunately they're all reverse engineer at the same time so what we're saying is you no whitelist then use their service and your you should be running a lot better quality list
 can you talk a little bit more about how the whitelist is constructed like when somebody when it like a pot if you want to work with a pot love with you if you want to work for the DSP that DSP comes to you and just like we like we've got these requirements we've got you know we want to run we don't want to run on on sites with guns and murder and lizards but we do want to run on site with ice cream and travel and here's our current list of domains that we are running on give a bit more of a description like for the engineers you're listening like how special she cares about is how you give you have to work between the humans and the automated service sure so again so let's just go back in the DSP example and let's just move it to an ad Network example cuz they're the ones that usually procure the inventory so we're working on
 behalf of client a client the client has established their criteria and we sit with the client at the beginning to understand what they like and dislike it's very much of a dating process we have a very good client service team that kind of sits and does a lot of the talk with the client we then get the ad Network inventory they sent us all the domains we look through their domains be at a crawl look at the scores pull up the scores and start to understand what falls in our scoring system that would be acceptable
 for this brand we then share some of the sites to get a nut again another sense of where this Brands head is in terms of their threshold to then continue to expand the list and make sure that these domains are acceptable to this Advertiser one of the things I'll say is the machine is is does a lot of the heavy lifting and in terms of looking at all the variety of ways we look at for Quality so it's add to edit ratio it's it's words on the page and works density there's an author ship there's recency you know a great one is new sites they're caught categorizes new sites but they haven't updated since 2013 there are a lot of factors in which we look at quality and what we look at for Quality Inn fraud and everything else that goes in from the machine you know for fake news again there are words that came into the marketplace like MSM is mainstream Media or or crooked for crooked Hillary
 word density that we've decided to go so then your time still uses MSM are crooked because of referencing someone something set but then when we have a cluster of these words and we see on this new site while then the human then takes another look and I think it's really the machine in the human looking at the same time or at work passing it to the human is really where we've seen the most success and and and is if you start looking at more and more fake news sites and unfortunately have two wheeler another themes which we feed back into the machine ads like the the amount of bad you have edit is is words on the page so I had to edit Ray show me add to editorial ratio so so there there's a privacy page of some fake news sites that I found that have you know very good paragraphs however had 10 ads on the on the page so I found a website that is that I'm not going to name here but when you went to the brightest
 it had 10 ads and when you went after you went to another major Advertiser it was 10 of the same Matt of a major Advertiser and and we caught this for a variety of reasons but I kept going back there and then looking cuz it just gives me good ideas of who maybe I should call next
 and now they've taken the Privacy page off
 they're at the footer you can't get there but it's still there but it's still there because I have the existing you around so I keep going back to this one and seeing now there's only three ads on the page it's unbelievable I mean you see things in my day job that you don't want to see I've seen very aggressive porn unfortunately I've seen a lot of hate and hate is a very very big thing and it's getting worse and I would say that's one of the common themes lately of more more request coming from advertisers to stay away from hate you no fake news really made the news at the election and has been ongoing but some advertisers are not as concerned as others but hate everyone's concerned and I think that's really been coming more and more into the Forefront but it's just been really good talking to you I'd love to get a picture for how you think things are going to change in the next 5 years I think the hinted at that with maybe
 more Google more Facebook more Amazon but maybe there's some interesting other trends that you're thinking about like you know when I think about a lot it's just the The increased ability for computers to generate content on the Fly you're starting to see some Amazon experiment with this with this computer-generated advertising we're basically just take an item that they have in their store they just like turn the stock footage or the stock pictures into into ads which is pretty straightforward and Bland but it's actually really effective it from my point of view I think it's like a typical Amazon just like ruthlessly cheap but really effective him but it'll get really interesting when you see when you start to see computer-generated on the Fly creative that's like aesthetically appealing like you see at the example I always think about is like a computer-generated version of like your mom serving you a Coke
 or something like that but what do you think is going to change it I think that's probably more like 10 years outboard you think is going to happen in the next 5 years I think it is not going down it's the amount amount of reports to keep coming out with frogs going down there just flat-out wrong for the people who are focused on them it is going down to someone right that's part one so far it is not going to ever go away and unfortunately isn't it more sophisticated into your point you're going to have more and more websites being spun up with a lot more sophistication you're going to see and you can go to fiber and by content how people write articles you can go to Mechanical Turk and have people write content you can have you know a lot of these new Services come out in in in continue to build Now video content but it looks actually very real that's the scary part of it all is I think they're only going to get more sophisticated but I think
 buyers will start to understand the risks and pitfalls Associated to buying programmatically and will be more aware of some of that that the roles and responsibilities of the detection services like trust metrics and others play and I think you know they will start pal holding people accountable and when I say accountable they won't pay people if they learn at their media is being given two bad guys and in being wasted and I think you know it's going to get worse before it gets better is what I've been saying a lot lately I think there are a lot of a lot of the inventory is fake so that means a lot of the companies that exist today are not doing the business they're saying they're doing the risk is the public companies that are involved if there are some public companies that are involved in in some of the supply the riches it's going to go down there for the rest of the Market's going to go down for for the an ecosystem I think the the tech stocks are going to get hurt
 but they were all bounce back in a lot better way once we Shuffle out of the shuffle out and get rid of some of these bad guys in one step buyers become more educated I think that's when really will start to see those Trends Spike up bounce back because advertising at least the hypothesis I think is that it's one of these things to sort of like like alcohol or gambling where you look over time and it's like regardless of the depression or the base of the economy I think advertising pretty much stays the same like people just continue to spend the same amount inflation-adjusted on Advertising I could be wrong about that actually I meant by just making that up I think what you're saying is it that that there is an adjustment here and I think the adjustment actually is once you once you start fighting humans with your advertisements it will work and once you see that work
 can you put more money in the channel and once you start putting more money in the channel you will grow your business too and I think ultimately that's what's going to happen and advertisers have to get to the point in their mindset that it's okay to spend a little higher CPM on on good quality Impressions because ultimately if I'm reaching their humans not just an impression loading I will have the ability to sell more product and if I can do that I keep my day job and I think that's really what we're going to start seeing is that the advocacy from agencies saying we need to spend cpm's higher in the fight with the advertiser getting to the realization of the CMO saying yeah you're right I got to go tell my CFO this news and having a CFO accept that
 okay Mark well it's been a pleasure talking to you on yeah trust metrics makes a lot of sense to me I wish you the best of luck and I look forward to talking to you more about these interesting issues that a lot of people are afraid to talk about I hear you I hear you thank you so much thanks

Transcription: at the first software engineering daily beat up the speakers explored a range of topics a few weeks ago we published Cortland Allen's talk about how to build a small software business in today's episode we are publishing haseeb Qureshi talk with just called everything that rises must converge why Engineers disagree about everything and why fraudsters due to this talk Explorer philosophy poker software engineering fraud and a basket of other topics these might seem like a random collection of topics but has seen currently works as an engineer on airbnb's risk team is of it also the author of how to be a poker player which is a book about the philosophy of Poker so he has a lot of experience in this broad range of topics this audio was taken from the meet up and we cleaned it up as best we could we will do a better job with the audio from the next Meetup which is Thursday March 9th at Galvanize by the way you can check out our meet up
for more details and I hope you enjoy this episode with a seatbelt
 when you are continuously deploying software you need to know how your code changes affect user traffic around the world a pika system helps companies with their end user experience focusing on availability and performance test monitor and optimize your applications with a pika system with a pika zebra tester a pika load test and a pika synthetic you can sure the your apps an api's work for all your users at any time around the world a big a zebra tester provides local load testing for individuals small teams and Enterprise devops teams to get started quickly and skill load testing as your needs evolve a big load test ensures that your app conserve traffic even under high load a peek of synthetic sends traffic to your website in your API endpoints from more than 80 different countries ensuring wide coverage right now you can go to software engineering daily. Com a pika for a webinar about the real Roi of API testing you can also
 find past webinars such as how to optimize websites for fast load time go to software engineering daily. Com a pica to find the latest webinars on load testing and lots of other topics and check out a pika system for testing monitoring and optimization thanks again to a pika for being a sponsor of software engineering daily
 what's up today seems to think of a change of pace because just because I talk is everything that rises must converge why don't you disagree about everything and why Fosters do too I was just reading these five pretty late last night and it occurred to me around 1:40 a.m. that my subtitle had a subtitle
 hello the newspaper probably bad. Woohoo. Go to Voya but do not know I've done 1 episode myself which is this one which if you have to listen to it already you should cuz it's okay it's pretty good as Jeff explain I said English and philosophy in school and I had no idea that I was going to being a software engineer I did went to a coding bootcamp I actually moving to San Francisco a little bit under 2 years ago and I went to a bunch of stuff now I work as a software engineer at Airbnb on the risk team
 so I was talking about that I was thinking about all that stuff but it's basically who I am so to the past if you've heard I guess the number different topics on software engineering daily sorry I've talked about negotiation I'm talking about the relationship between programming appropriate bucket by putting you can suck that alone but today I'm not going to talk about any of that crap so hopefully hopefully you weren't expecting me to
 tell if you want to try to sit out this one of the toys crying a lot of stuff to do in the lobby so basically the study of knowledge and epistemology is the study of the nature of knowledge justification and the rationality of belief I regular is actually a diagram of Joseph Gall inventing the first Snapchat filter that was actually in the eighteen-hundreds a lot of bad joke too so you know they're actually all that so just do people go to that anybody know anything and you know it got me so I've kind of had something about I guess like a chameleon in that water through a lot of different worlds
 and I come seeing how things that people say they know different so much between different cultures I just like human cultures but some cultures little girls that you find yourself in a poker player being a software engineer working fraud in the street right like you're all places where you find what we can really learn how cultural the concept of knowledge really is so first things I hear the people tell me that they no. JavaScript in the future don't know that everybody should know see that Russ is the best language for systems programming as we touched on a commercial databases that scale that TV is a fantasy and nobody seriously serious actually doesn't and convincing you about anything but I'll be great talks for 530 why people disagree about these things that many people claim to know
 single kind of things right people would say no limit is dying. Olympics Games missing everybody needs to use a hard they would say fish play Lose passive styled and there's a wonderful and allergies I think
 knowledge or is it believable knowledge that shares even if they're in the same in every way possible and they say to themselves not true if it's true what should I do about it like inside of you oh my god and I don't know see what I asked I didn't know that why do they think they know that and what is it about the waiver wire that belief that gave him so much conviction in the first place that they noticed
 do the regular programming to me is that nobody agrees right where all these things that people argue about all the time about every morning programming functional-programming robust old sandwich shiny new one right we will just disappear. Almost everything you might think this diversity of opinion. The people disagree I think it's weird it was weird that people don't agree I don't want to develop in you and intuition also why is that why you should feel it's also weird cuz it makes more sense for people to agree there for them to disrespect
 deprime flips the typical model of job search and makes it easy to apply to multiple jobs and get multiple offers and deprime simplifies your job search and helps you land that ideal software engineering position candidates get immediate exposure to the best tech companies with just one simple application to indeed Prime companies on indeed Prime exclusive platform will message candidates with salary and Equity up front so if your engineer you just get message by these companies and the average software developer gets 5 employer contact and an average salary offer of $125,000 so if you're an average software developer on this platform you will get 5 contacts and that average salary of offer of $125,000
 80 Prime is a hundred percent free for candidates there are no strings attached and you get a signing bonus when you're hired you get $2,000 to say thanks for using a d Prime what if you are a software engineering daily listener you can sign up with indeed.com SE daily to go to that URL and you'll get $5,000 instead if you go to indeed.com daily it would support software engineering daily and you would be able to be eligible for that $5,000 bonus instead of the normal $2,000 bonus on indeed Prime thanks to indeed Prime for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily and for representing a new way to get hired as an engineer and have a little more leverage a little more optionality and a little more ease of use
 systems tend to converge you should assume that it's going to converge on what's optimal but it won't go to direction of its optimal state
 Eloise book Example The Guardian anything appropriate word understand this strategy called set mining try to play a pocket pair okay so basically if you don't forget Delta Perry if you have to tell two cards making pear and easy way to try to make sure the pipe if you make if you don't you just pull it that's Mi super super simple it was a pretty simple and stupid strategy we can do it and it works really really well
 and what is a pretty soon when people start talking about set my name is the information starting to hang out there in the world almost everybody so I can set my name is Lauren Wood Stakes for foreigners good easy and almost everybody did it spread like wildfire on semi everybody saw the set mine was The High Ground it was to rain and when I move in a direction that it doesn't know how to get there who said my name is a pretty strategy to you where are you have to think in terms of always doing the highest TV thing or the highest expected value thing and I don't always do whatever it is that you believe is Optimum
 what did it was really interesting to me about poker cuz if I join us we're playing poker run 2007 which was hiding a little bit after the very peak of all I poked in terms of like getting acceleration in popularity and the roof by say anything about online poker to me
 sing to me is how it changed poker strategy for ever and how quickly it changed and I think the only way to got to go pop in the United States and sometime in the early eighteen-hundreds 1900 something like that in the fifties and sixties and seventies and eighties and nineties card room they were in casinos in people who playing in Dallas playing in Vegas and clean car rims and caps figure out things and they just played the paper and everything in the shooter that you can just going to play poker in your boxers at home and you know not get out of the house it'll change that but the biggest thing in the changed is it changed the way in which the system we can
 the way in which people can communicate with each other and see what each other were doing and it allows them to coordinate and converge and what happened was it if you imagine to the graph of flexible poker strategy flat flat flat flat flat until about 2004 570 skyrockets everybody search of converge on what the optimal strategies are there what the best way to play poker is where the for it no one had any idea there was no way to actually arrive at the strategy a graph it's actually nothing particularly is really loud
 I think I actually was trying to set up the side of a Minnesota raffle absolutely nothing wrong with what I was talking about but I think you said feeling right if I was talking about what is it was a tall OK Google converged live poker they playing poker and get them or casinos does not converge and did not converge and it's interesting to me and it makes sense to me that they would do that picture is full of conversion systems so I imagine you were going downtown San Cisco and you buy a loaf of bread you know like I don't know who's buying what's the bread I don't like 80 truck stop in Street Fighter
 what does a course of pigeon surrounding right piece of food right around this love weddings. Food somewhere in Selma is actually I don't know why I chose a German around seem like I'm coming right back but it's actually a cell wall fuse over the cell membrane and then get this is Convergence right where the density of water molecules the same on each side of the membrane same thing you seeing markets their thing you seen you in a while
 lightning striking all these things are convergent systems and to answer to working at Airbnb as an engineer I should have looking for that same kind of convergence so I also work in the in the Frog space does a lot of things that Airbnb encompasses is fraud so if you're bad actors trying to defraud us either the money or trying to hurt our users or whatever works to fight against that has a key parties are safe listed by the world of fought by end of the world is fighting fraud and it's neat but I'm not sure that's really where it's really actually they're diving everything that you're doing and if so will pick you us when you know you're still fighting it from one side and just kind of spring water from afar
 alright so this is an awesome picture of me actually doing Fridays during our time the hand there that's people robbing Us blind this is actually where the picture of my job and I don't know what to say when hear the question that I have when I see the World of Fun is I really want understand how do fraudsters make the decisions that they make I don't know what to do right now responses are going out there attacking one of these online sites are there tackle Facebook Google Airbnb Hoover whatever I didn't know that they should attack us how do you know how many little things need to learn how to do it right and how do they know what they know about our sites about a week about the best places to farm people
 what are we going to do the question I want to know is is there conversions in far is actually a real photo of the new Macbook Pro they just have to turn on there I don't know why
 rapper jokes about the project to go well yeah thank you thank you all right
 don't have much for New Year's Eve in the Pod space I just assumed side inner what is chipmunk I don't know which chipmunk is doing great she would listen to both of your payment you better answer me right so I don't know why I guess you're receiving shipments are so I don't know answer your appointment you back right away I don't know okay
 chipmunk a scale I'm going to keep adding the same bank account on all these other accounts and everything to keep my deposit of myself I was going to write some like selenium sure if they'll do it for me and then I have no of doctor a day now Michael deposited $100,000 in my account and nothing common if you who went off like this so wish I could actually knows what happens after the Super popular is that the purpose of 1% supporting arguments
 I was weak an endpoint and it becomes a fire but it's very rare that kind of departing us and little bit a little bit more on what are almost always happens that oh crap everything okay we got to go fix this right so that's what happened to her call me Wade Spurs add where did the supposed to do now speaks the most vulnerable most profitable most worth their time place
 and this makes sense this is converging right this is what you expect out of a conversion system which is very satisfying to me when I think about that the more you bug me about how this whole thing works it's just a question that I didn't answer why are they just riding us at all
 it was a dumb question I have course that kind of money right well aware that there are so many out there that you can find a company that has any significant internet presence is one of us some kind of pot and some kind of way to make money off right there's some to Pieology where each one of these Peaks and valleys of points in space is a company that you can attack everybody we converge on the police right over his water company is just the most lucrative fraud
 expect all the fraud will just be concentrated unless you coming
 the song you see what you see is just a sample level fraud everywhere a sign of of sufficient scale and end in probability even if the car is not at Liberty to say that crazy everybody get some fraud this is weird but this is Frankie was weird why is this happening in sponsors does not care about making money that I care but optimizing their time you know are they just played in the sky. What's going on you all these computer things in space to solve your problems and software to convert or was it supposed to present right
 we have one no one ever wins anything anymore but realize what you know and it's like really cool and it causes damage when I'm cool like that when we have an appointment for every you know great right what is it okay why I know why I don't wipe software doesn't convert writing to the obvious answers that will Southwest Sauce multiple problems or Friday it was trying to make money by sitting in the car people kinds of problems should I can get one to rain and one pecan one to know one maximum whole different to rain in the human Batman's no difference between social networks right I do have bear Maxima but you know the actual situation
 there was even a single parent you don't see conversions on how to build credit as it's over the last bill and I both have vast majority of people who disagree on satisfactory to explain why you don't see conversions in the world of software
 what is you should want convergence convergence means that we all see the underlying to rain it was we all actually know what is good and what is less good what is actually useful to us what is actually optimal I mean we all do the best thing it's actually good for all of us online poker or maybe on my cart we're not all competing with each other right we're actually all kind of side by side and helps us when other people do well so why do these systems not converge
 I need a phone rings and I'mma tell you in case you're worried rain is unstable in software are you learn what time works really awesome and then a year later oh my God we had came in for everything on the water I got to unlearn angular 120x you know everything's changed right we need to read this article is pretty pretty big heart feels like spring 2016 I don't know what he's talking about you cannot open this article everything changes and software really really fast right and 75 years ago was like oh my God Java is just the best thing to learn and idea where the top of the job and that's the most important thing and then a few years later it suddenly job is really relevant and if the train is constantly changing actually stay at work maximum because
 I'm assuming by the way happens in the Waterfront because it already fried you don't even say that Facebook is the best way to the farm right now it gets beaten and beaten and being withdrawn I don't like him it was really bad on the ship and they do all the people who spent all the time learning on your Facebook or kind of should I don't want Facebook and Facebook is wild west and you can get instead of making $20 an hour now you only make $3 an hour to find Facebook locks already given time so I have course when fostering when we know it would hold dispatch boxers visiting Vegas trips to go find the next thing and

 13 reason why I think these systems don't emerge one of these is Java Island I don't know something I was Pascal whatever you know where to buy job it would go away but I have to travel to New Orleans distance and do all this work and have all these opportunity cost until I can actually get to The High Ground changing call me not worth the risk right angle and the fact that it's actually very hard to do that switching makes it less expensive for me and makes me I'd like you to want to do it and the same thing again happens when you become a really really specialized hard for you to ride a horse and skills
 can make more than $2 an hour to fighting anybody other than Facebook even though Facebook is now not to go to the Target
 is it going to take information sharing this is a big one and I think I've been describing the spot I don't know what is a very cooling system trying to space way in order to actually learn what are the best way to defraud winning strategies people using money for fun horses actually whiteheads around like towing capacity thing either other than horses you can buy on like how about places like that they cost money people make money from this is an industry yourself you better get magenta see if that people trust you but it's a DayQuil system you guys decide one day hey there what I know what about 5 I'm going to go buy a book on the front professor doesn't work that way people share information online strategies are generally not for sale
 add Vegas people who have the most information to protect and of course there's a lot of crap out there that's their look what information that is not very good and I'm strangely Southwest post farthest right of the spectrum you can possibly get right right when I go security systems and so you just broke through and somehow it doesn't
 so you can imagine the space of programming being not just a friend but it's marketed to it and it makes a lot more complicated right now around Ruby Mountain super Java Lords and doesn't work out so well in other rules on what you can and can't do the same thing happens in Providence where are they talk on you know whatever channels we chat or whatever and the show information about how to attack number and if you don't because
 psychological social identity theory is that a large part of what you think of as yourself what makes your identity is your adherence to Roots tickets to social categorization okay but we should doing you should come hang out if it's rain and these people are losers and these people are engineers and these people are I don't know weirdos right where we should we should party life is Albuquerque categories dividing the world into groups when you choose which groups do I know if I want one that's that's great lovers whatever I don't know
 Atlantis the Lost age is social comparison right now do you have to be to work at deciding which ones are better than others and why what's up where you know there's just one group that has I don't know if so are they going and why is it different different because of the boundary right there on whether or not you have a stardew valley happens if the same thing happens in the movie distinguish between the end and the out-group elections where the line is very dangerous in maintaining the social identity I was busy studying how people differ with in the same group
 to take me to the folks in West Side Story
 the boy look exactly the same
 angry exactly the same clothes clothes why why don't you just have to struggle because it was strictly small differences among each other but still maintain membership in this group Rite Aid closest friends all rooms and close all the time I'm going to the same places every night
 creepy about that and it's not as creepy because people would think about what it means to be part of that group and you totally Google bunch of yourself from the other numbers right and so bad but then he needs to a lot of this siloing beginning scenes balkanization of the world of fraud the world of engineering
 what I want to say is that we should want to find what really is the optimal what is the p in the strain that we're traversing on a note of matter what should we do about it if you want to fight against this corrective delusion of these differences Andy's group identities and inability to actually see clearly it's raining so I hear you're not probably over time before Paul grandparents the state of this
 people are going to be small or the news is let go of your group identities the water of who you are and what you believe most deeply about what makes you who you are you willing to explore different things then the things that you think are intrinsic you and it's really uncomfortable and it should bring comfortable doing it supposed to say is Explorer like really be willing to move across the train and two tickets to self probably give me the greatest single place give me the you're doing what you're doing you're probably on a local pick somewhere right now exclamation problem Michigan Explorer know most people just hill climbing gear where they are and they stay there and almost always what's going to happen to you because the train is moving is that the place that you do
 was a peek at the time that you turn traversing up that hill is no longer be same class with me and the only way that you're going to break that is by continuing to explore that's why I talk to see thanks for listening
 a few things before we go if you like the music on software engineering daily you might like my most recent album called commodity which features a lot of the songs that air on this podcast my artist name is the prion that's p r i o n on Spotify Apple music and Amazon also is having our second meet up March 9th at galvanized you can find details on our meet up page and finally we are about to post our second listener survey which is available on software engineering daily.com this is your opportunity to have your voice heard and let us know how we can improve this data is super valuable to us and we look at every single response so please take the listener survey at software engineering daily. Com thanks for listening to all these announcements will see you next time on suffering Gene date

Transcription: the changelog is one of the most popular software engineering podcasts in existence open source software moves fast and the changelog help software Engineers keep up with a rapid Pace by publishing consistent podcast and newsletters when I started software engineering daily the changelog was one of the podcast that I look to for inspiration on how to succeed as a software engineering editorialist or podcaster Adams to Kodiak and Jared Santo are the hosts of the changelog and they join me today to discuss how open source has changed since they started the podcast in 2009 and how it will change in the near future before we get started I want to take a quick moment to thank the people that have been tweeting and posting and telling their friends about software engineering daily because the community is growing and it's really meaningful to me that people are taking the time to help us out with that grow I also want to let you know that are slack Channel and are new
slider both what you can sign up for at software engineering daily. Com so thanks for getting involved with the community it really means a lot to me after a quick message from today's sponsor we will get to this episode the change the lock was Adams to koviak and Jared Santo
 podcasting full-time is a great career but if I ever return to the normal World of Warcraft hired.com is where I will start my job hunt hired.com removes the frustration of searching for a job you just fill out your profile and the jobs come to you Facebook Uber and stripe are a few of the companies that are hunting for engineers on hired go to hired.com se daily to try it out and get an extra $1,000 signing bonus just for using the URL for software engineering daily listeners which is hired.com s e g daily did you want to try to go to hired.com se daily the demand for engineers is higher than the supply and on hired.com that translates to higher salaries and happier careers for the engineers who find a job on hired I used tire to find a job before I became a full-time podcaster and the experience was so good because hired connected
 what's a talent Advocate who work with me to find a job that was a good fit and the town Advocate answered my questions about negotiating salary and finding remote work which is which were some of those really important to me at the time so check out hired.com SE daily and get a $1,000 signing bonus upon finding a job which will be a great job that will give you the respect and salary that you deserve as a great engineer so check out hire.com SE daily it would support the show and now what's going on with today's episode of software engineering daily
 Jared Santo and Adams to koviak are the hosts of the changelog a podcast about open source software in the people who make it jarryd and Adam welcome to software engineering daily yes sir hello thanks for having us so let's start by talking about open source itself how has open source software changed since you started the changelog in 2009 yeah 2009 hello man Stephanie gotten faster we started out saying open source moves fast keep up and I feel like that's been a trying to statement that it's only getting faster and that it's obviously gotten more social things to get up and people following that methodology of social coating I think that it's obviously gotten a lot more interesting a lot more diverse honey it's because solvers got more diverse much open source but in a people are and I hope this doesn't come back to bite me but I feel like it's the seventies a little bit Jared and I know where it's it's sort of hippyish in a way and it
 play answer the hippie Revolution coming back because of his worst kind of reminds me of that peace love and happiness kind of thing you know where everybody is all about keeping the peace know about inclusion and diversity in equality and things like that would stroke great things but I feel like that's this this new thing that's come back from their of the 70s just kind of interesting to me we think your dad that you know since 2009 I think everything has gotten centralized around get Hub so much so that even large corporations are embracing open source Microsoft Facebook I think Google always kind of did from their Roots but you don't seem bigger players come in and then mix it up and and have huge impacts and then also have Fallout so corporate interests are they are even more so a line with open source and they've ever been
 I think I just think that like the increasing globalization of software development is going to exchange open source more cuz like I just figure I mean obviously we have an increase in diversity on a domestic scale like no more women and minorities for example are becoming software Engineers but also you just think about like if all these people from say Africa and China they start to come into the open source community and served by Metcalf so I ended up the network is the square of the nodes in the network as we get more people from International places starting to contribute to open source we might start to have this you know even even bigger increase in scope and diversity of the types of Open Source software we see the app and maintenance burden
 talk about software engineering and in the ecosystem it makes our job I think more important because as you have more you no more noise it's harder to find the signals and so when you're looking for that library that in a parse Json in your particular language and there's no 600 of them with different limitations or various levels of support and yeah if I need the one that's right for you is difficult but what leads to an open source project either succeeding or failing that one out of town I think when these two of the first leading I hurt your feeling it starts the community I mean obviously it's around the software but it depends on the community propping it up cuz we see this in several different cans were community in the fall apart or every coming in at just left communicative that it's really around the community and then obviously this offers going to have a true needed me to
 so what's your problem but I think it really results around people I think you know where the most interesting I think that we've done around the change login obviously has Jared has said tracking open source is less just around the soffit I can begin their the original idea was obviously as a change while we thought let's create a podcast around talking around the cheetah from version of version I'm suffering that obviously has gotten too much bigger idea but you know it started out with much track the software and I think what's really interesting and what really defines success for the front is the people behind it because without the people you don't have the software and what's so interesting is that obviously the community is so important as a point of Leverage perhaps and I think the most successful open source projects they often have a charismatic leader at the center of them you know like with Linux you have Linus Torvalds and rails you have David heinemeier Hansson is that a trendar are there to see open
 what projects did do not have any centralized charismatic leader
 it's a tough one I would say strong leadership is a necessary part of any thriving Community charismatic leader I think it's a little bit of a slight distinction away from strong leadership somebody's who's deaf in influence her I mean as to try it really looking forward towards the side is they have to be able to influence people not so much just charismatic very true that influence people but maybe they don't necessarily need to win friends in the case of stuff that you did if you didn't if no one could influence anybody and I've been you're not going to get any followers so I think it takes a level of the following somebody down a particular pathogen ideology or Paradigm or language or a new Direction and I think it takes somebody who's influential and obviously some is intelligent too but I don't think charismatic I think he leads
 but only in in so much as drama and just things like that get you excited cuz everybody loves drama maybe not the date of the community interact with but the large majorities of people really that's why there's a TV right you don't watch that you don't watch certain news stations or whatever because their informative that's great but it's also the drama people tend to gravitate towards but I don't think it's what makes or breaks up with some communities in front of the drama strong community that doesn't have strong leadership of course we have that statement to be dfl rights of an interview but never went dictator for life or some people think it's absolutely necessary to the success of a project and so we have people like dhh like Guido van Rossum on and so on
 there are other I'm sure there are other projects that don't have a single leader but they have to have strong leadership sometimes that's represented in a core group you know I sent a note with the io split and the reform mean and the foundation formed and that board at Hahnemann the hot works anymore but I know everything voted on it and it's group decision and and so yeah I mean you have people who think you have to have a single leader and then you have other people that think it can work in the morning mccratic way but I think the key is strong leadership whether it's a single person or group Nemesis vs. BHA tonight in the leader is always it's also a good thing Arrow versus W get
 okay so let's talk about some of the different verticals of Open Source there's projects like react and almond Vue JS and then there's like a back in projects such as I do and then his project that are important for both back-end and front-end development is Ruby on Rails nodejs Docker guys have any particular preference for which area that you focus on at the changelog 0/0 preference preference fresh and new and open source that's been our staple but I think it's grown more and more as we can I set a little bit ago where it's more round people sweet we like to highlight things that really are interesting obviously the right kind of people the right kind of projects the right kind of ideas that I can have influencers not just simply around the right kind of area of Open Source that really matters like Greg Gnostic topaz for think it's more of a eye movement of an ideology and that's
 help us over the years because whenever you see certain camps flounder or certain can't become stale and become older not cool anymore whatever we've been able to keep our brand name so to speak untarnish by any sort of change in the equilibrium of the source because we rike Gnostic and we think that there's interesting things Jared you can back me up on this but we see interesting things to as we interview so many different people that lead open source that are influenced by other languages let me just talk to Matt's and match was influenced by pretty much everything was Major like he took all of his likes Small Talk of Pascal he's interested languages and said let me create a ruby that matters to me let me Korean language that matters to me and
 I think that's what you find an open source that you see that it does really matter where you come from in terms of a paradigm it it's sort of like what is driving technology forward and make this offer more useful yeah I've always been a generalist myself I think you are certain people to say specialized be the Hadoop expert and I think that's a completely legitimate career path or way about going about your work I've always wanted more interesting to generalize and try to touch on as many things in software development as you can because you everything fits together you know whether as a house of cards are now or as a beautiful young mesh Network are we going to view that but it all comes together and so we're very much generalists we go where there's interesting people and interesting Technologies and I think that our job in exposing new ideas in a new things if we are focused simply on front Enduro Focus simply on the web which honestly if we do have a guy bent it's towards web but that's just more out of habit
 development evolves in a way where people tend to think that they need to specialize in a specific vertical different things and I also don't really like this idea of oh you're a jack-of-all-trades your master of none I see no reason why you can't let me be a master all of these things but get a really good understanding of all these things if you really want to but I see you certain pressures from maybe corporations or from the certain assembly line mentality that certain schools teach that maybe drive us to word this path that say oh you need to be a spring expert and that's going to be your career for life or you needed a real sex for you to be a doob expert and perhaps Shopper hasn't been around long enough for people to realize that these are kind of dog was that we're getting shoehorned into butt or maybe I maybe I'm just on a soapbox what do you guys think
 on your soapbox with you so I guess you are on a soapbox let me join you and then say that into a specific maybe a soap box that's too small there enough so from this Podium let's just say that it's important to understand the full stack it's important to see the big picture and not be a cornhole rails developer I know the young people you say are you a jQuery developer are you a reactive don't know I'm a software developer can I do I know react sure little bit I could stand to learn better but I'm sure I could do that in a fashion that is productive as well and so we need to be able to cross boundaries we may be able to move on because what's in today is out tomorrow and even more so that's becoming truer and truer and say I want to put yourself inside of a divisional
 small those are small so open source is important and it's always going to be important but there are an increasing number of paid software products that are closed Source but are incredibly useful like us or a sick of all these software-as-a-service products like Dropbox or Trello or sauna ship maybe and it's very different from the days of shelf where where in the software that you bought off the shelf with totally outdated in terrible the minute that you bought it like these days it's not like you know the open source software is is just definitively better than the closed-source software often times the clothes or software is taking care of things that open source by definition cannot take care of like this very easy planter or procurement or whatever so do you guys think that the world of closed-source software is it evolve in a way that makes it more appealing to you to like record on perhaps
 started to think about cuz like there are types of clothes Source software services that you can make like these are so useful to developers and it wouldn't make sense is an open source project code shipwright wouldn't make sense is it open source project on poster software and it's interesting there's always a commercial angle to it and that's kind of where we find sponsor Partners where we still do help tell their story but if they're going to reap any benefits more promotional ability so to speak then we say you know we open those arms up we say pets help us out cuz we need to sustain ourselves and you know open source is free and open source and it's a community around it and then we we found to fund so to speak out always which is just one of the way it's not the only way but that we find ourselves going out to those interesting clothes sourced commercial gaining isation's the saying hey if you want to you want to work with us then you can't even support
 Source through working with us and then we can also promote your software and find unique ways to promote your doing okay I see so so I guess we will report on it but you know she didn't start with cold sores that start with open source and so for those reasons it would it would seem like pulling the rug out from underneath anyone who followed us that doesn't mean we can't add to but I don't see the change log itself the podcast ever-changing from shine away from coming open source you show that focuses a bit once it like that potentially but the cheese look proper as a podcast will always remain open source focused open source is so pervasive amongst these new clothes Source software services or products that you have couple that you named we could definitely go and interview people at Trello and talk about the open-source stuff that happens at trial out because they're definitely involved in that or total eight of us has an entire world
 stop were built around it you know we had Facebook on the show to talk about react and react native and we're trying to get them back on we're scheduling with them to talk about just the general conversation of Open Source at Facebook because there's so much going on there even though Facebook is a closed Source platform so I think its angles into it but I think the open is always where we're going to focus on the past it seems like the long-term Arc of clothes store software is that eventually developers who use it they get locked in and it might eventually resent the software so this was this just happened with Windows Oracle more recently kind of happening with AWS and Azure and Google
 what are you think about these different models for building close Source offer is there a way to to maybe take lessons from the open-source world where you can build closed-source software in a way that doesn't leave to developers resenting what you build think the company but I was laughing we were at my my wife's company and somebody held up something I'll have to or they would like to check out the spec book it was like literally a book and it was a spec book of a particular area of their product I can ask off. I feel bad now doing it by going to stop this is like this old waterfall way of doing things nothing software you start at 8 or 8 through us you never really know what you're trying to go you're trying to solve a problem and you know it already went through it you eventually get to maybe a place where people don't exactly want you to be and you know you're not always all in the right section of the crowd to solve the problem I think you know you end up in a we were you eventually fence
 and that's how you have competition I don't think of resenting you know software that you use is a domain Neo specifically taken out by closed-source proprietary thinks there's plenty of people who feel in trapped by their open source projects as well as presenting them just as much so I don't know there's any lessons to learn from your side no
 it's a very good point I think GitHub earlier or Jared may be as kind of this inflected point on what enabled open-source to really take off do you think we will see another point of inflection with dr. ho
 I don't know I don't have enough experience with Docker Hub but something I've heard recently was who was it somebody was using something from there no it was actually I'm just seeing this but it's the it's the Hitler movie that they use in meetings or Hub and it was like this interesting thing around how the note was using a public image of Docker Hub and how that was like a No-No cuz you never know what's in there kind of stuff and long story short I just think that's certainly opening up the door to things like that but I don't know I don't have enough experience with it personally to say yes or no
 officially now right so maybe potential security vulnerabilities just sent you the code and you're just willing to using it then it could potentially this thing really negative towards him on a turkey I think straight without her up now I got zero what does I'm just kind of sitting quietly other half of it. I'm kind of a doctor Luddite you know where I would get I am brace kit immediately and I gave it a huge hug and a lot of people especially that were happy with the person can I didn't see it at first and maybe I'm just sitting now I'm becoming just like Docker I like I get it I understand what does a stalker files everywhere and I just it doesn't fit in my work clothes yet so I'm just like completely on the sidelines for that one
 yeah likewise I-5 in her doctor on the command line less than 10 times so I'm totally what I imposter whatever it was it was packed cuz it it had the word Docker in the title for the talk and I think it's the this interesting box that solves a problem for a good majority of people in Ops but for the general developer day today they just there's interesting things that it does but as you said Jared just hasn't entered your work though and wife interesting as a generalist potentially to always keep your eyes like that because it is so interesting it does seem very unique things in a tablespoon unique things that you want to keep her out on it but I find that the more more people I talk to they just they pay attention to it but they never actually use it day today it's sort of like in this particular area of Ops that only is useful there and and there is really useful now but yeah I think
 also because I don't collaborate too tightly in large teams and so I have less of the pain of bikes that saying somebody else up there having a project that has a doctor file you can just run it right away so it depends on you like you said if you're staying where you're a large Dina's collaborating you have lots of different projects that each have their own specific dependencies and what not I definitely the value of doctor and get help for Docker I just don't have much inside be on that question first question just why did you ask that question when were you expecting what do you think about. Grab yourself a bunch of shows around container stuff recently A lot of it around kubernetes and Docker swarm and Amazons container service mazos fear and it's kind of hard to see exactly where we're going with this but it's very clear that there is some serious investment in serious competition around who's going to build the de facto
 platform that you use to containerize your data center so right now we just deploy the yams mostly or we just deploy like a very straightforward containers that basically look like smaller BM but the vision for the future that it seems like these different companies like Amazon and Mesa and Google are trying to lay out is like you're going to want to run your own data center effectively you're going to want to have bass jobs and you're going to want to have a long-running jobs like Gmail if I'm a consumer of a Google technology I'm going to want to see access Gmail which spins of a container somewhere and I'm also going to want to have an in Google's going to run fast jobs that are going to process data on me on a nightly basis and Google wants to be able to manage this across a data center in a way that's really easy for them and they're thinking is well in the future everybody's going to want to do this like why wouldn't you why wouldn't you want to have this amazing
 abstraction that allows you to really easily manager batch jobs and really easily manager like user session type of jobs like Gmail or Facebook or whatever and so everybody is realizing this well if you consider everybody to meet mazos Amazon Google Etc that's the vision and that's kind of why the corner of my eye and I'm not dealing with this day today cuz like I'm a full-time software podcast not writing code on a daily basis so all I can do is ask people who are real deal with the day-to-day like what is exciting about this project to you and it's just your The Sting that just comes up over and over and over again about all these in his all these different applications were obviously we see it today basis we talked to you was mostly about like yeah I was using us to help my deployment standardized my deployment but the long-term vision for what it enables is so much bigger than that so it's almost
 is primitive the enable so much that we have no idea where it's going to take us almost like the smartphone or like a w s coming out that is the sense that I get about what this technology allows having worked with it myself in a all I do is just talk to people about it all I can really do is speculate in hypothesize and and ask people like like you guys so what that's really keeps getting more and more interesting and I certainly keep scoring more interesting with that money right. Started up and sores and they they went from dark clouds darker which we covered way early we have only cover doctor much since then but it went from. Cloud is a service to Crazy Doctor The Source technology and now there's a company called doctor and then obviously a lot more people there and moving this technology forward to it keeps generating more interest
 okay I want to talk to you guys about the changelog itself and its of these questions self-interest is you guys have been podcasting about software for so long I really like to get a feel for how you think about doing a podcast and talking to people about soccer exotic Communications about software the person-to-person communication aspect is something I could really learn a lot from you guys I think the listeners could also learn a lot to get better at communicating software to people then you can save so much time in the development process so do you guys try to get with a given episode of the changelog how do you figure out the right balance between technicality and approachability that's the balance that we struggle to strike I think that we just let it happen naturally we can let our own interest and Technical ability or lack of ability to lead a conversation
 we do get together and talk about what you know what are specific things that we think are interesting about this person or this technology and we try to focus on pulling those things out
 how specifically technical to get you know sometimes we leave that to the gas weed to tell our guests you know you're you're talking to developers you talking to technical people so feel free to get into the weeds if you think something is worth explaining at a technical Depp's and you can do it in audio and not to draw diagram or something take us there and we'll go there with you as far as we can sometimes we have to dig them out of the weeds you know then bring it back up to a high level but I don't know if there's necessarily a science behind it Adam what do you think I think the one thing you said Jared and I never really thought about it like that but we Face our imposter syndrome so no one else has done I think we kind of take that same that you know everyone has that self concern I guess that they don't belong or they don't know enough and if anybody should be hosting this show it should be Jared and I because we know just enough to not know any at all and we do when we get there but I think that when it comes to a science I don't think there's a
 what signs do I think what I think it is the beauty of what is now the change. Cuz it's actually changed over over it's time to different hos working with me on it and stuff like that but I think with the current version of it is why latest version the best in my opinion is that it starts with Jared and eyes relationship like he and I know how to talk like anybody else would I think Jared to have a good relationship with understand one another and so we don't compete on the show from Mike time we know that it's not about us and it's really about what's interesting and what's important to focus on for that gas the weather's technical whether it's Community weather influence whether it's their background Jared I work really well together to figure out what is important in a very short amount of time we don't spend a ton of time playing in the show some shows a bit more than others but most shows are usually done within maybe an hour hour-and-a-half of prep if that and we share a Google doc in a we have a pretty easy process but I think the it starts with Jared Nuys ability to
 have a good conversation together and then pull a guest into that and not worry about making sure let us it's it's really about the guest the science is pretty much that in a my opinion Jennifer are so so obviously there is some advantage to doing shows about topics that you're really not familiar with because you can assume that that you know if you're doing reporting on software you can assume that most of the listeners have about the same level of experience like they've read something on Hacker News or likes it even more likely they've seen a headliner Hacker News or maybe skimmed an article about a technology nothing else so it's good to begin a show from a beginner's mind set in and not have so much knowledge about technology not having done some crap that's why the word to use theirs Outsider and more so the beginner cuz I don't think we ever Philly for beginners cuz we do have history and experience and that
 speak to beginner I think it's more like an outsider or someone who's newer to something doesn't exactly mean you're just beginning with lack of knowledge is is kind of a beginner usually tends to signify its more like in my opinion it's more like that like an outsider coming in or someone who is a little less familiar with it and I almost like a child like asking like hey what is this doing why does it work like that because that's where the general majority is usually thinking and again back that imposter syndrome thing they tend to not ask because like I want to sound stupid there's times in a journey that we ask good but silly questions sometimes just because you can't help it if you don't understand something or you don't get why some The Works the way it does you ask and you didn't answer hopefully from the first and then if there an influencer their leader and they have good qualities like that they're not going to like treat Jerry now like idiots they're going to help us understand something and it there by the audience listening this recent stack overflow
 survey that put the average experience level of software engineers at 6.5 years which means because of that SKU there must be tons of newer to be first what do you think is the average level of experience for a listener of the changelog or whatever I would say experienced and in my opinion I don't think but then again I'm always surprised because we get tweets Jared from people that are that seem to be maybe newer software development we even have people on like rockbot who hasn't been in long but she's got a good technology experience giving her schooling background and what she's done with you know in JavaScript and node and robots and Robotics and stuff like it's really an interesting the first crowd I think what we tend to gravitate towards
 I would tend to listen to our show is is Les around maybe the experience I wouldn't say we try new developers maybe we do I don't really know why I can't really identify my exact thought about it because I think that we have a very diverse crowd some really really Technical and some that are really knew I think we served or pretty broad audience in that regard people who interact with surveys or anything and just know like a jar experience analytics so we don't have you know hard facts about any of this it's all just who talks to us and then we never listens and yeah anywhere from beginners to very experienced I think our show is approachable for people who are either Outsiders or beginners to two specific things and yet because we don't Focus we do talk about technical merits and value that software brains in and struggles as the leader of a project or as a maintainer or type of things which I think are valuable for people of all experiences
 so because we're approachable and yet we also do provide these kind of big picture value propositions and insights an inspiration I think there's people cannot take aways of the boss. I hope so yeah so one thing I think is interesting about software podcasting is it the change orders been really successful and I think one source of that success is that the idea of a high-quality software podcast is for many reasons is kind of unlikely because so a lot of the podcast I hear the wild subscribe somewhat similar like I said there's a lot of like entrepreneurship podcast you can see the same surgery like motivational people talking the same kind of entrepreneurial people who are building their personal Brands and stuff and a lot of that is I think because like these are the people that they have to do what kind of their job is to Market themselves and their Persona and their entrepreneurship and whatnot
 and there's nothing wrong with that it's great but software on the other hand like if someone understands software really well most of the time they're just going to spend all that time like all their spare time is just going to go to the writing code or building some kind of software project architect in the shop or project generally speaking did not going to spend their time doing the types of stuff they have to do if you can be a software podcast configuring WordPress or like figure out your RSS feed if we spent 7 Minutes doing before we got started which is totally typical for a software podcaster so I don't know I don't know what question I'm driving it here but given how interesting and how expansive the world of software engineering is why aren't there more great software engineering podcast we ask yourself that question every single day
 Elliot we in this all that problems would agree but you know I think you said something that was successful for us as our focus on quality and that's been our thread since the beginning if you listen to the early days of the changelog to current days of the changelog we've definitely gotten better and it's kind of funny cuz I was literally going through a hard drive last night trying to organize old files with it at The Archives stuff and I was going through and I stumbled want to hear that it said it would be funny is I don't know why but I stumbled on episode 10 of the change blog and I don't know why but I caught myself listening to some of it and thinking this audio is horrible wow but the conversations are great and so to zoom back a little bit and not bore you with the details of that episode 10 which happened to include Chris wanstrath when the creators of get Hub which is a great episode go back and listen to don't judge us on audio quality but was interesting as we always focus on good quality but it doesn't mean that it had to be
 audibly quality that was always the goal but it was really focus on great content and everyone says great content I think that some of the podcast should mention or styles of podcast where you tend to have this typical interview interviewee kind of situation and it started this linear fashion and that's what the cheese all was built upon and we've gotten better that over the years with interviewing somebody but it's what you asked them in the things you focus on that really pull out the right kind of things and it mention that we talk to people or software podcast talk to people that don't tend to be enough self-promotional sure there's been at least a couple times I can recall what we've talked to me like this is the first time I've actually talk to somebody like this week I've been focusing so much on writing code and I think that's the beauty of it is because we talked to we talk to people who are that need to tell the world about what they're doing someone in particular I can think of is like Tim Caswell I don't know how often he gets on a podcast when he does it's great cuz the guy
 does deep he's always on the is not on it he is the edge in terms of a lot of stuff he's working on and I'm always always take him back by the things you're talking about so he's one good example of someone we've had on the show that's just like get him on a podcast and have him just talk about it too long cuz that could be interesting and that's the best kind of a successful point that we focused on him to try to push that button harder and harder this week as we go along the podcast infrastructure for the web in many ways it's exactly the same as it was when podcast were invented basically you subscribe you know I try mean like so like you subscribe to an RSS feed to the signs on the wall that podcast usage and distribution is going to change meaningfully in the near future or intern
 actual Market over time people have tried to have these like boil the ocean Solutions basically any good ideas that will never change the they may influence but I think there's such a stronghold from iTunes had it's like we're a small fish in a very very very big universe don't even ocean because like it goes beyond the ocean Gardens somewhat universe and it's still the same there is a story about that I think that it's just a shame because there's so many things that dare not personally talked about on ways to improve the overall thing but everyone is locked into it like the idea of how podcaster to ship it right now I don't think is going to change I hope I'm wrong but I don't think it'll change for 5 years at least I mean I think it's getting to the maybe I Maybe I'm Wrong chairside know if I'm wrong but
 I just don't see it changing cuz it's such a Goliath and you know Apple just so used as a strong hold on it because it's your marketability towards the devices the software and then ultimate of platform that it all sits upon no one Hoster podcast on iTunes but it's all distributed through iTunes and since they are the largest provider they didn't dictate much like good with us with search and so for that reason if they don't change it doesn't change and so begins with an apple in my opinion like I think if you're listening to the show you're from app when you're involved in that area come talk to us we have ID is or just listen to the market or at least change cuz you haven't and you're breaking the system even though you made it
 hey guess you talk to the folks at a cast I don't know if you have but a very interesting conversation so we can make a stream Spotify of podcast X Spotify people working on this podcast platform that's pretty ambitious but pretty interesting maybe I'll put you in touch with them anyway so K C's of podcasting which is content consistency and community and I think that these three are definitely keys to building a successful podcast maybe they were all the several years ago but these days there are so many podcast and it can be hard to break out and gain growth in popularity even if you just have really good quality content consistency and some community
 is there anything else you guys have done to encourage growth is there anything in particular is obviously like someone in self-interest but anything you do to market the changelog that works particularly well
 I think that is broken I don't think it's that's kind of weird Jared I begin with some of the problem it's all with podcast and how does it shoot it is is being write them as we feel like the only way that we can see that people find us is when someone says Hey on Twitter they say you know I'm interested in getting the podcast which ones do you recommend we see your name pop up in a slew of other names and so that's you know on the marketing side of it but in terms of a good show and getting a market for that show I think it's totally stands on most Reese's it begins and ends with content and Angela quality in the community can't be dismissed from that because if not you would have anybody listening to it and you have to focus on Quality Inn at the Quality is an expensive topic where it's not just the audio quality it's also the quality of the content and the community around I think those things are
 exact what you should focus on them focus on anything else is a loss leader because if you don't have those three things then you don't have a podcast audio doesn't travel online video doesn't like text does just does not you never heard of a viral audio clip I haven't no serial serial podcast this is the one thing that and traveled and that use that actually spread mostly word of mouth and got some media coverage and stuff and because it was mass-market appeal and I should move beyond the bounds of those podcast and then we're all grateful for cereal because it actually expanded the audience for podcast quite a bit it gave an open eye to how serious of a medium it can be and I think people listen to Sugarland and what not in very unique places you can take video there but video requires your eyeballs requires a lot more attention where there's a podcast you can sort of Listen to If you wanted to and you can sort of pay attention
 do you want to chat okay but what was cereal actually that great or do you think it was just in the right place at the right time like it happened to be this podcast it was like that have to be honest here I have literally not listen to serial to like half of the first season as a kid I don't listen to any of it for a reason I did want to be tainted and the reason why I want to be tainted is because I'm sure that the style of production is is very interesting and very good and the way it was produced it obviously sounds great I didn't want to be influenced in a bad way where if anything I ever did was copy something like it so that's one that I purposely stop didn't want to listen to because I feel like it's like the prettiest girl in the room and you don't want to look at her right I know I'm taken from one thing but you don't look at that girl because it's like Medusa and I'll turn into stone or something like that I feel like my God but the point is if you looked at her something bad would happen.
 I feel about Siri looks like she was not a woman so it shows gender agnostic I'm sure of it the fact is is like I just didn't listen to it cuz I want to be tainted by it and I think that those tiles up shows or can be really interesting I think that if you apply that same kind of Science in terms of how they designed the show the design that podcast if you took that same science and applied it to our world as we get very interesting expensive to produce a podcast right place right time but it's also a compelling story and so I think at least America perhaps you know the global market woke up to the fact that podcasting is a medium in which you can create compelling high-quality Holly produced content is like a mature two guys in their basement talking about space aliens or whatever that stigma is I think it legitimized the medium but the show itself was not it was quite a risk because basically they were like
 audiobook that is a season of a podcast and we're going to invest so much resources into it and there's any was that sense of continuity like an hour podcast continuity from 1 episode 2 another other than like him again Toro it's drive again and now he's a completely different and there's no I don't think so I may disagree completely but I've been listening to audiobooks on Audible for years like literally since like 2007 like as early as I can go back audible like I never got the free code because they came out after I started using it I told him I've been listening to audio programs and there's a lot of money invested especially now in audio books like I just listen to The Martian I listen to the Revenant on audiobook and I haven't seen I saw the Martian in theater and then listen to an audiobook on that was far more better than audiobook and has a book in general and the same of the Revenant I haven't watch the Revenant yet and I've listened to it and I Hugh glass story
 audiobook was Holly produced background music and different effects and stuff like that I think it's always been there you said has it been the right place right time for Cedar I think maybe that was just the first we paid attention to it because I think the quality audio has always been there but not so much for podcast the median right right right as a distribution means that I was talking about right you know entering the body of the like the audiobook that's what made me think about audio audible ride but just point is that it's a risk for them to to release cereal as a podcast as opposed to just an audiobook on Audible or is that what you're saying Jeff or maybe we miss read you be at the side of it I was just thinking like it was unconventional because the way that you could listen to serial of the place of felt like an audiobook to me well then it's a good thing to think about there's just something different something different they took a risk and so in your case when you said invest a lot it's a risk so I say you know if you want to add one more to the three C's address in there take a risk to something different
 I see bro but it's the ticket Crest Christopher Fisker whatever wrap up this is somewhat orthogonal to previous conversation but all these shows about like coding bootcamps in like online education all these new ways that people are learning to code another thing that came out stackoverflow surveys that I think most most of all fours like more than 50% are self-taught how important you guys think that formal programming education is
 not very for being a productive programmer. But I think it's something that you should backfill as you go out into the workplace and they should always be educating and I think going to traditional means of Education as a decent way back feeling but no I don't I don't believe formal education as we've seen it in America with a 4 year degree system my name is required for seen many many people highly successful who are yourself Todd or the product of non-traditional education I guess it brings back home for gnats that Jared is I just thought of this literally on the 2nd year traditional schooling reminds me of waterfall vs. agile where is like you know that and I like you going to call or just learning this thing and hopefully this job when I get there and where is with self-educated you're sort of iterating everything I've ever done I'm self-educated I have seven top others but I've gotten done
 I buy my own inertia and I wasn't created by some sort of school or 64-bit program and I figure 8 through everything and where I began isn't where I'm at now but I got here because of brass started and so I think it's like waterfall vs. agile in this case where traditional schooling is a 4 years degree hopefully the job there where is the kind of now begin with the another shiny object like oh I can do that or I can be in this unique place and here's a pack of get there and there's another path to get there and you start a leapfrog down this path and and eventually get to something that adults what you want to do
 Yak I love that so what one more question are you guys up against time are you okay with one more question one more question that's it interesting what I think about changelog stop fronting daily and the way I consume software media in general like reporting on soft reporting on software engineering it feels like there's some gap between the potential and where we actually stand like there's the Fairly technical content that I consume that's like O'Reilly or maybe the chainsaw bar or my own podcast or some video on YouTube it's like a conference talk that's highly technical
 there's that and then there's like other stuff that's more consumable like wired or Hacker News or just these things that are like much more readable posted on Facebook and where it's like you know the news sort of bumping up against technology and real world is digesting and interacting with technology but I feel like there is this gap between those two things where the software that we interact with on a day-to-day basis that the highly technical meat is becoming more and more impactful on the real world and simultaneously the real world is becoming increasingly Reliant and insistent on consumers understanding how technology works and I feel like there is this diff between those two things this margin is getting closer and closer together and so I guess I'm curious if you guys feel the same way and if you have a perspective
 what the future of software media and salt for consumption by your average like blue collar worker what is it going to look like cuz we're the ones doing the work but I don't know who you think I am make sure I understand the question so you want to know how we think software engineering related media will be consumed by blue-collar non-software workers are you referring to like everyday coders by everybody by everybody MSNBC CNBC or MSNBC CNBC CNBC so it's like it is acceptable in the world to have a 24-hour News Channel that's basically about money and business and it's basically the news in the world do the perspective of money and business and that's what CNBC is you'll still see stuff about like Donald Trump and Russia or whatever but it's all
 through the lens of money and business so why aren't we looking at the world through the lens of software engineering is because to me it seems like the super important lever that is being used to impact change on the world but there is some inability for the average public person to understand how those things are changing I'm just curious like you think there should be a 24-hour show about software engineering and how it relates to the world world is the reason why there's a money channels because everyone loves money for one and it makes the world go round to the great - driver makes the world go around to the degree that's that's true that's Point does I don't know I think I kind of look at it like concentric circles like you have certain level of technical expertise and that's going to be your smallest Inner Circle always
 and then you're going to have people that come up but up a next to that Circle but they're not inside it and they're going to have their ring of news or media outlets and then you work your way out and maybe as a gap in those rings but I think you can go from you know / R / programming or Hacker News as maybe your inner circle I like these are the people who were even more so I would get Hub issues red 40 were discussing us back and then you have if that makes it to the Outer Circle maybe it makes it a hacker news and I never makes the next or maybe take me and covers and maybe not that's what I think's interesting sometimes that news does leak out like in the case of left pad right in the a.m. p.m. gate has are calling it now he wakes bags are that was reported on the register some other news like just Jay sights and so there are things that make it outside of our little Echo chamber and regular p.m. and if you read those articles in fact we almost linked one up and change lock weekly but I just couldn't link it
 cuz it was so dumb down, I couldn't do it cuz I know your audience will be like this is a terrible write-up of this but for its intended audience right it's kind of like them all the Walt Mossberg version where he's a tech reviewer but he speaks to the common person you know and so his reviews are still very well written but there is no way that I would turn my nose up a because I understand the technical details of the device or whatever so I think that works itself out naturally is there a Gap in understanding absolutely but as software Engineers if we're doing our job right like there should be a cap like people shouldn't have to know about does breakdown in theater internet infrastructure because you know somebody pulled all they're all the refills off of MPN or other packages so we're good at what we do we can create a black box and Regular Joe Schmo doesn't have to care at all it's all her bad at it that they end up finding out
 yeah
 okay well cool that said I really like that explanation of the way that software technical stuff propagates around the internet I think left Patty it's a really good example I've been listening to change lock for a long time and huge fan of the show so that's awesome thank you for listening for what was the first episode you listen to her how far back you go you know probably something about Ruby cuz the first real internship I had was doing Ruby and I was when I really started listening to software podcast but I'm not sure when the first Ruby show you guys did was so I don't know if that's the beginning pretty much well I guess I was actually on go so that's how far back I really go is crazy we had Rob Pike on like way way early
 I'm just curious cuz you know
 at your address so you like you I'm one of those people who there's like a topical have to do a show on top of this topic as much as I can I'll go back and listen to the podcast about about whatever that topic is and often times it leads me to one of your shows so I'm a big Greenfield consumer so I could soon the old green yeah that's why we do try to keep the show me try not to be exactly timely you know in terms of like news news show me try to be a bit more in a time of their content and the things we talked about and it doesn't always have we obviously mention things to happen today and save the day and things like that but we try to keep it like that but since you asked since we talked about the Quality Inn just kind of curious since you're an old hat listener have you noticed a change in quality not too much just in the content and also just the audio quality over the years
 definitely the audio Deathlands audio quality has improved and I think also your conversational style in your level of comfort has improved maybe I should be projecting my own experience on to you guys too I knew that the First shows I did I was like so rigid and not really comfortable and overtime you develop an ability to actually have a conversation you kind of get a sense of what the the type of conversation at a listener is hoping to hear and obviously you never get to that like best situation I can't I literally cannot go back and listen to talk to my old episodes cuz I just cringe a myself that's how I feel go back to them at and actually I did this last night as a test just for fun and I go back and I grab them and I pull them into audition and I
 EQ them better and I put the Noise Gate on them all those things and I listen to old version vs. how I do it now and I can actually go back and improve how it sounded even back then I can't improve how stupid I sound but I can change how good it sounds so that's that's been a fun adventure for me they really need an audio plug-in that does that there should be a human head okay well I will thanks Jared and Adam I appreciate you guys coming on
 thank you so much.

Transcription: over the next few years Bots will provide Our Lives more and more these smart conversational text interfaces provide a new way of engaging with the computer systems that we've been mostly interacting with through web and mobile app interfaces for the last decade Bots are a necessary compliment to the voice interfaces of the future because we don't always want to talk to the computer and natural language processing is not yet good enough to always translate are vocal requests accurately Bots are not toys they aren't trivial and they are going away anytime soon John Brunner is the host of The O'Reilly boss podcast a show that has quickly become one of my favorites because it covers both theoretical and applied artificial intelligence while remaining approachable to listen to John hosted with Pete's, Roku works on a bot startup full-time and John and Pete were also the organizers of O'Reilly bot day which I enjoy
tremendously I got a lot of Knowledge from so thank you to O'Reilly and thanks to John for being a guest on the show I hope you enjoy this episode
 when I'm choosing the tools for my side projects the first thing that I look for is ease-of-use that's why I love mongodb it is the most popular non-relational database and it is super easy to use at the beginning of a project I often don't know the shape of my objects and Mongo makes it easy to evolve the database schema as I like overtime overtime as my project gets popular I'm going to need to scale and thankfully mongodb has built-in horizontal scalability but configuration and database maintenance aren't really what I want to spend my time on thankfully mongodb Atlas was released in 2016 mongodb Atlas is the easiest way to get access to mongodb without having to run the database yourself you pay only for what you use for small projects all the way up to large production deployments to try mongodb Atlas today go to mongodb. Com
 daily and get a free $25 in credit use promo code go Atlas 25 to get that $25 in free credit Atlas is the only hosted mongodb service built by the engineers behind the database the company mongodb with Atlas you get into end encryption you get VPC peering to get access to the latest releases and for a limited time you can go to mongodb. Com SE daily enter promo code go Atlas 25 and get that $25 in credit and get started with mongodb Atlas thanks a mongodb for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily and thanks for being the database behind a lot of my favorite side projects in the past we're really happy to have mongodb as a new sponsor software engineering daily
 John Brunner is a host of The O'Reilly box podcast John welcome to software engineering daily thanks Jeff go to be here lots are important and over the next few years were going to see them pervade Our Lives more and more and this was something that I didn't really understand before I started to listen to the Bots podcast could you host with Pete's komarock why are Bots becoming more prominent Jeff there a couple of things going on here one is that the way that people use their mobile phone is changing you might think that almost 10 years now after the release of the iPhone and and 8 or so years after the release of the App Store people would be downloading apps all the time and you know using their phones to their fullest extent but it turns out that the app economy is really stagnating that has become very difficult to get people to download Noom
 collapse and get involved in sort of new mobile practices and it turns out that most users of iPhones and Android smartphones especially younger people are really just using them for messaging for 4 IM and for texting through platforms like SMS and WhatsApp and Facebook messenger and Snapchat so I'm that's that's one thing that makes Bots appealing that you could have these little in a fragments of software living in a chat application that a few years ago you might have put into a standalone app but now no one's downloading Standalone apps anymore everyone just wants to use messaging on their phones it is similar to the idea of everything being moved it to the web browser and you don't have to download any software you just access everything through web app yeah that's right I mean when's the last time you you know downloaded and installed on a desktop application for your personal computer
 it sounds so old right Central changes that are going on is that the only thing that's going on here like cuz the idea of boss have been around for a long time I mean it are there other are there other things in the water right now that are causing boss to become more prominent yeah you're totally right the idea's been around for a while the other thing is the emergence of practical artificial intelligence so the AI landscape has changed really dramatically in the last few years between much cheaper Computing in the cloud and ubiquitous connectivity that make it possible to connect to that really cheap Computing plus there been a lot of advancements in the software techniques for artificial intelligence so it's getting a lot easier to write software that can interpret human language and I make sense of it and then come back with a response that makes sense a new interface for old applications have been around for a while or is it
 platform that unlocks completely new functionality there are a lot of people developing Bots that basically reproduce existing app functionality things like you know Bots little book you travel reservations or box little check the weather for you and tell you what's going on but there are also some new applications things that haven't been handled well by software so far that look like they'll be compelling use cases for Bots things like scheduling meetings you know for the last few years a lot of people have developed things that you know websites where you can go and you can send someone a link and say hey let's meet up choose a time for my calendar here and this webpage will kind of mediate our schedules things like that and ever caught on but now we have stuff like Laura and excite a eye Witcher bought assistance that you see see on your email and then they jump in the way that a personal assistant would and kind of facilitate a meeting so that that's arguably a new Apple
 Asian for software that might really catch on what's the general case that we can extrapolate there so like a point out and Clara as these good scheduling interfaces you know you schedule a calendar event with somebody instead of having to go back and forth you use the bhat which intermediate some of that what What is the generalizable characteristic there that we can observe about the scheduling Bots that makes it more effective than the web interface that we might be able to extrapolate to other applications it's really good with putting the question it's a you know these are these are bits of software that communicate with users in human terms so you're not asking users to use a computer interface your you're asking them to interact with the software the way that they're used to interacting with humans you launched the Box podcast about 3 months ago I think 3 or 4 months ago
 your opinion of bots changed over that. Of time I've actually become a lot more positive about Bots since then and talking to people who are creating botson and preteen the underlined Technologies in Platinum skeptic I was a bit of a skeptic yeah you know it it felt like something that that was beginning to arrive in terms of the underlying technology but in talking to the creators of this stuff and talking to people who are using Bots I become more convinced about their commercial prospects and inserted social prospects I think it was like 3 or 4 months ago I was sitting at a table at a restaurant in San Francisco with some of my friends who are all in Tech and I was the only person at the table who was saying like no I think the Bots the spots are actually useful everybody else the table saying all this all this Venture Capital money going into boss it's all just wasted money I mean look in all fairness it hasn't really born
 in any direction yet there's no as you and I have seen in doing interviews with people and seeing the school presentations at bought day there is something here there's did it's not an absolutely nothing but it is unclear as of yet if the investment it has is overheated right now that's right and it certainly looks like am a trend that popped up out of nowhere you know it it it was under a year ago maybe roughly a year ago that you started to seize or the classic beginning of it which is a handful of of well distributed venture-capital SAS you know beginning to talk about the possibility of of box in this kind of software interface and then they're they're followed a lot of medium posts and back in June I went to a a great small bot conference called botanist that it's really it's a community event that folks from the
 platforms and then some of the startups all work together on and even back in June people were sitting at this gathering in San Francisco and going like a boxer over man it was ridiculous there's there's a way that I think the community get skeptical of things that arise very quickly and then you're right that there haven't been any runaway successes to have been any exit certainly there haven't been any yet it will actually there have been a couple of big Acquisitions Viv was was acquired by Samsung a couple of months ago and API. AI was acquired by Google but the most part you haven't seen this really you know bear fruit in a dramatic way so so people are naturally a little skeptical because it came up quickly and and seem to go everywhere this is of course the problem of following efficient market hypothesis and tracking Investments like
 they are a direct reflection of reality rather than a distorted reflection of reality I think another example of this is Bitcoin you talk to even people who invest in Bitcoin and they'll say something like in a Bitcoin there's no killer app and the reality is that the infrastructure is not there the theoretical underpinnings of Bitcoin are very powerful and that's not going to change there is something they're the same thing with these chat interfaces whether the the ecosystem underpinnings are going to develop anytime soon or not is Up For Debate but it was just a nation field and a lot has to go right forever for the stars to align for it to get Mass adoption you know for something and then you have all these other things that could potentially intermediated the augmented reality comes to mind of augmented reality becomes
 take maybe that totally changes our perspective for the interfaces that we want to be engaging with think about the Bitcoin thing I like I think about I think about the relationship the the comparison between Bitcoin and the boss podcast I think like starting the boss podcast 3 months ago is kind of like starting a Bitcoin podcast 5 or 6 years ago where there's like a few people who were involved in Bots and you know if you spend a lot of time in that Community might seem like everybody's talking about but in reality he's a few people who are tinkering with it the most part Engineers are not thinking much about Bots would you say that's accurate yeah I think that's accurate it's it's really right now in the stage of you know a lot of there there are a handful of startups in this area a lot of investors are interested in investing in companies in this area but haven't yet done so and then among the
 companies that something that's kind of on the on the horizon for like RND groups that are charged with you know familiarizing themselves with with kind of the next thing they're there commissioning some you know trials especially companies that deal with customer service like airlines are really interested in this but but it's not something where you see developer racing to add Bots development to their stack you know them and there are a few reasons for that I mean it's you know it's not a hugely widespread phenomenon yet and also it requires a skill set that slightly different from actually considerably different from web development if you need to know something about AI something about sort of linear user interfaces is there a bit different from the DUIs on the web your company runs on Apple.

 building a bot is more tree for it's just this text interface despite that seems like you still kind of need to piece together all of these different tools today there's not really like a Ruby on Rails for building a bot right there there are a few Frameworks that make it a little bit easier how to use one of the really popular ones there's also the Microsoft bot framework that do some of the work of you know abstracting the the interaction with the platform so you basically just say like send message here's the message and then you know what takes care of it that's especially true of the bot platform for Microsoft which which works across a lot of different messaging platforms and the messaging platforms themselves are evolving really quickly to become easier for developers to use that wasn't necessarily one of the concerns that they had when they launched these things a few years ago but they gave all the really aggressively added functionality that can appeal to Developers
 the tricky Gap right now is really in the AI and the natural language understanding the NL you that's an area that requires some skills that are a bit different from straightforward web development and there are some Services survey II as a service platforms that will help you with that but after you get past the the very early kind of wire frame stage most bought creators fined that they have to build their own AI in some respects it at least to work with any kind of specialized application mean in this context at so so the artificial intelligence that's able to understand free text input and and generate responses so so that usually usually these platforms offer some sort of you know I'm headed the extraction in particular so they'll have tools where it'll take free tax and it'll look for you know a date and time that's being mentioned and return a well
 find a Time object from it or or look for you know is this answer essentially yes or essentially know if someone writes now does that mean you know then it'll return like a false object and if they say yep it'll return you have a true object to talk about this in lpnl you stuff and he may have to build a Proficiency in it if you want to get your Bot really good is is the technology there I mean even if you have a great Proficiency in and even if you're at The Cutting Edge is the NL you at the in the in the best applications is it good enough to provide a good enough user experience this is something that a lot of people in the bot World talk about you know why Siri is so frustrating and not used very much versus why the Amazon Echo is been such a huge success and the thinking often goes along the lines that Siri kind of over promises and under delivers
 and the echo does the opposite so Siri gives you the sense somehow through a series of little Q's through its advertising that you can throw anything at it and we'll come back with a brilliant answering it off insertive teases you with like a a snarky answer the echo on the other hand basically goes in with the promise that it'll tell you what time it is and handle timers in your kitchen and convert between units and then you discovered gradually that it has all of these other capabilities that are really incredible so it so it's not just the quality of the AI it's also the the quality of the design that guides the user in how to use the AI okay so we're getting into the speech interface competition discussion and this is not a consumer electronics podcast but I actually just want to ask and I just want to go there for a bit even though there are so many other podcasts that have this conversation
 I'm sure people can go listen to many many other shows that will go into this discussion but from a technological standpoint like and from a business standpoint we're both armchair critics of what goes on in business and technology I find so I've heard that narrative the idea that like osiri under. Over promises under delivers I think there are other explanations like even if you had not seen any marketing for Siri and you used it and then you use Alexa or even Google home you just be like so much worse it's just stanningley worse I think it's a lot of it is there's something like the speaker is not good enough for the there's some like Layton's weird latency issues that are not intuitive compared to like the the latency of of Alexa versus versus versus Siri so much better and I remember I don't know if you read this article there's some article that came out about like
 how Bezos was involved in the development of election he was basically look latency is going to be really really really important here yeah that was a killer Insight that how how important like the quickness of the response was and how hard they worked to get that latency down I think it's evident that the Siri Siri development has struggled there cuz I mean I'm sure you know I don't think you know when everybody is criticizing Siri I don't think we're telling Apple anything that they don't know it just must be really really hard to iron out that kind of like you know you can't put the genie back in the bottle you can't like just agree it's probably really hard to refactor to get the latency significantly mean if you're if you're comparing Siri to both the Echo and Google Now the the advantage that the echo has is that it's plugged in so it's it's initial latency is always going to be outstanding because I can draw just a little bit more power
 in order to always be sort of on standby and in the case of Google Google's advantages that it has the entire web to learn from and I think one of the successful things about Google now that always disappoints me when I use Siri is like Google Now is sort of natively oriented toward performing a web search so you have it it it falls back onto just showing you a page of Google results which is often actually what you want Siri kind of has this approach where it's like I'm going to I'm going to answer this question for my own internal context and if I can't then I will grudgingly show you a list of of search engine results for your query so it's a little more I mean I so I ordered I hadn't I had an Amazon Amazon Alexa and then I returned it because I saw the announcement for the Google home and I just assumed that the Google home would be better and then
 I got it and I've kind of been underwhelmed by it compared to the Alexa like I had a much better experience with the election I thought was interesting because I used Google Now the the phone version back when I had an Android device and it was awesome but there was Stir some Gap in the usability for the Google home I don't know if you had the same experience that's interesting I've only ever used a Google home in a store setting so I haven't played with one it at home but I was reasonably impressed by it in the store there was someone serve guiding me in in suggesting Aquarius to give it to that that might have had something to do with it but did you find it's less less flexible or or seems to learn lesser I think it's like okay this is exactly a very specific critique of it but the main thing is that for some reason it doesn't integrate with a with Google apps for work account so I can integrate my Gmail
 from a work account like at you know most most my emails go through software at software and Jeff it's offering daily.com and for some reason it doesn't integrate with a work account and that has bent that is preventing me from personalizing it said this is a totally biased deviation okay anyway we should talk more about boss I was sorry but one other question about the sister so how are the plugins do you see a good you know University of of skills so to speak available for the you like search Google for like recipe for braised short ribs or something and it gives you like that card so you don't have to go to to recipes.com or whatever you know bloated adware site you're going to go to you know you don't have to experience that you just get a card that experience has been awesome and you really seem like the advantages of Google doing the thing where they just extract information from a site and give no ad Revenue to that
 site so that's been awesome and there's also like integration with Cora and I love Cora so this is me a couple times so I can ask it a question it's like according to quora something or according to product hunt according to the according to Wikipedia and the Integrations there have been really smooth but what I will say is there's just been a lot of times where we're Google simply says I don't know how to help you with that and I remember the graceful degradation of Alexa being a little smoother huh also has a few different failure modes that are really interesting and we discuss this once on the Bots podcast with Kathy Pearl who's the voice user interface designer the the Amazon Echo has kind of these these three different responses if it doesn't understand what you said then there's the voice that says I'm sorry I didn't understand that command or something I ate or I didn't understand your question and then there's another one where it kind of goes like poop
 it makes a little high little sound and it's like I think you said something but I'm I'm not sure I'm just going to turn off then there's a third one when where it's it's listening and then it just the light just goes off and it doesn't do any right so yeah it has it has this very graceful well-thought-out to his series of of failures as simplified AB degradation think so okay getting back to the bot podcast what are the themes that you're seeing emerge as you host more episodes I'd say the the core themes these are really Mehta themes are how early this whole environment is how an N end Sub sub theme is the degree to which everyone is just experimenting with this stuff right now just throwing ideas out seeing if they get some
 Usery seeing what their reaction is inventing new products sort of to test they some of them seem a little trivial but they are you know you have to have some trivial use cases so that you can understand the environment and then you know sub-team to it is how quickly all of this is developing and especially if you talk with the people who work for the big platforms Microsoft and Google and slack and Amazon they really been putting a lot of resources into supporting bot developers over the last 6 months to a year really the developer tools have been available to the public since kind of last spring in most of these cases like March April May so they're developing incredibly fast every every week brings some significant new revision to one of the platforms or tool kits so that that's something we we talked about a lot we also
 talk about the user interface aspects and and what sorts of Provisions people make to to help the user's figure out how to use the Bots this is this is a huge headache for a lot of people who have backgrounds in web development or or other forms of more traditional software development where you can you can create a drop down menu or a list of buttons that show the user affordances of the software you know you can click here to search by time you can click here to search by City you can click here to open up additional options but when you have a bot you it it becomes really tiresome to say how would you like to search you can say search by City you can say search my time right so so there's this real art to to communicating to the user how they should go about using about are there any particular episodes
 that come to mind that really changed how you thought about the space well actually the very first episode that Pete and I recorded which was kind of just a a download with the two of us where we talked about what we have been thinking about with respect to botson and how we saw the area developing and why we are launching the podcast that was one of the most informative conversations that I had cuz I got to basically start push Pete into explaining himself and is interested in inbox and he's a really sharp analyst of this area so it was an end of course I learn a lot by trying to explain things to other people so that was a really clarifying experience we are trying to give the listeners some sense of why we are interested inbox and why we thought they were exciting so it was great to be able to sort of compile that and and talk through it there a couple others as well the one that we recorded with Kathy Pearl that I've mentioned before about voice user in
 facing the challenges there any idea that there is this new user experience that we have to design for we think of design often is a visual thing this is more about text and experience that's right yeah super lightweight visual experience really and in highly constrained to cuz the messaging platforms don't give you a lot of leeway to to develop your own user interface it's it's much more limited than what you would be able to do in any kind of web development you had Joshua Browder on and I actually had him on my Show recently as well yeah because I saw him at bought day and I heard his show with you and he is a fascinating character and he's I find his startup do not pay or I don't even know you want to start his product do not pay help you pay for parking tickets or it can test parking tickets I'm sorry
 it's interesting not necessarily to meet because of its impact although it is impactful it's like he's helping people can test parking tickets in a really easy way for what I found some interesting about talking to him is he had a really good explanation for one thing that is different about the interface of a bot and Justice idea that it's this year's model for his early model for the bot at least and how it exists mostly now is basically it's just this huge static decision tree and it's hidden behind a simple text interface but that's what it is like you are basically navigating a decision tree with a text interface and that was his presentation of what like why I bought lick here is one way about to be useful like why would you want to navigate this huge static decision tree using a website that's not up that's not a good experience but the idea that you're just doing it through this this texting her face is really awesome
 fine like I asked and I think it may be gets at the idea of you know these answers we've had in the past where you like call into a call center to dial 1 perhaps in like that just going down decision Tree in okay you know you're facing the other question dial 3/4 why are systems on the phone it's an analogy that comes up a lot with people who build Bots Joshua was incredibly bright and and he really did hit on something that could be simplified very effectively into just a text-based back and forth you think about you know you don't need any images for that sort of thing you just need someone to sort of ask you these decision tree questions and it makes a lot of sense to go through linearly rather than having some website that's you know type in the name of your city then hit next type in the you know where you were parked then hit next also you know he he makes a good point or his product makes a good point which is that there's probably plenty of other Lohan
 fruit that bodybuilders could create that essentially doesn't have a i in it you know that they do not pay bot doesn't use deep learning or anything like that as far as I know it is it's able to do this really important work just was with decision trees and then they're probably plenty of other applications that don't involve a I speaking of Joshua he was one of the speakers at bought day which I attended what were your takeaways from bought day so if I was really interested in talking to the people who came and asking them about you know the work that they're doing an impression that they have of the Box filled and how that changed over the course of the day so because I was a little bit of a skeptic going in and I've been gradually getting more positive about box and now feel quite positive about them I expected that everyone who came to bot day would be sort of
 the borderline skeptic and I also thought that over the course of the whole day of talks about the challenges and tools for building Bots that people might be more skeptical at the end of the day than they were at the beginning of that but we did kind of a show of hands of the beginning of the day and ask people if they really believe in Bots and most hands went up and then at the end of the day we ask people if they believe in box more or less now than they did when they came in and just about everyone in the room so they believe in pots more so have you been presented with this like rundown of the technical challenges and an overview of the infrastructure that you have to build and so on people were actually more positive about thoughts not that's been my feeling as I've looked at the stuff it it makes spots kind of concrete you can begin to see the path that you would take to a building box and implementing them and you can think about applications whereas maybe 6 months ago when people like Mark Zuckerberg and saw
 you know Delaware saying hey you can build a bot and it can take care of your stuff maybe you can order a pizza with a bot it was hard then to to believe in it cuz I was like yeah sure whatever you know we'll have a I like order us pizza I guess but that doesn't sound very interesting once you can start to grasp it in a really tangible way I think you can start to imagine how you would apply it and you can start to see the road map the building and out there any other interesting anecdotes that you saw heard at bought day when you lose all these people from around the industry probably engaging with each other for the first time did you see any interesting cross-pollination but I think one of the things that stood out to me is the start of the breath of of applications that people were talking about so we had some people there from you know consumer-facing rolls at financial services companies and and similar organizations who were
 interested in building box that could like handle customer questions and then at the other end we also had a lot of people who were building you know completely internal box to just to sort of eight employees and and the range of those was huge to you can have a bot that that helps out you know someone who's doing telephone customer service inside a call center or about the sits in the IT department slack installation and you know sends alerts to people instead of dispatchers requests and stuff like that so the breath of applications that attendees were interested in was was really interesting and I saw that when when I watched some of the interactions people as someone who's building at customer service bought talking with someone who's building you know an it a ticket dispatching bought for for internal use these are very different cases and they have very different
 the bot world is going to be a very broad conversation with somebody who was sitting next to me if bought day about an LP and we were talking about his startup basically was it and I think was an LP deep learning startups are basically something around using deep learning to power better in NLP and I didn't really like I heard that before and I didn't really know what that men like cuz I always heard like deep learning is great for classification problems were you have a huge Corpus of examples and you use the Corpus of examples to power improvements in building that model where you don't necessarily have to give features that describe an image of a cat but by virtue of having so many images of a cat you extract the features from that using deep learning and it didn't really understand how
 was applicable to NLP but then he explained it to me in the idea that you can do classification of text in a similar way that you would classify images you know you by virtue of having a large enough Corpus of data and you know I heard something similar to this on the Kimber if it was your podcast or Ben Laura cuz data podcast where did the phrase was text is the new images with regard to how deep learning is being applied to natural language processing hippie have you heard this at all yeah I think that might have been in our latest episode with Richard soldier who are who founded metamind yeah there's there's a lot of interest in using deep learning with text a couple of months ago Google released a model
 or parsing sentences using deep learning you can you can find it at they've they've been formally called it parsey mcparseface I forget what the actual name of the project is but it was very exciting when it came out in any rights a lot of the techniques are similar in the abstract to how you would analyze and classify images you can also use deep learning to generate content as we see where things like the Deep dream algorithm that that turns images into collections of of other weird images that is so so there's a lot of interest in that to using using deep learning to an end neural networks to sort of generate sentences that sound plausible and and contain some information that you're trying to convey

 speaking of artificial sentences that sound plausible there was this you know Bots affecting politics thing we had on Twitter recently wear during the election there were all these Bots that work are you major possible to tell a bot presidential campaign candidates Porter from a non bought presidential campaign support her do you feel like that actually had any effect on the outcome of the election I think fake social media Bots probably played some role in the outcome of the election the other probably more impactful thing was the kind of spread of fake news which which is right now the hottest Topic in all of natural language processing everyone is interested in trying to figure out if they're algorithmic approaches to to discovering you know fake news on on Facebook and other social networks you know social Bots
 can have an impact because they can kind of see Dan and stimulate discussions they can take you know they could they can kind of read things up at the outset yeah if you tweet something and it's controversial and no one sees it in the first 5 minutes then it just disappears forever if you delete something and an army of the 10,000 Bots retweet it over the next 3 hours then suddenly it becomes like a trending topic and a lot of people see it and it appears to have sort of weight and legitimacy it gives the subtle cues that the social media readers can interpret to to mean that the you know the statement was correct or or or worth considering so I think I think those pots can have an impact on the way we see social media users like the president-elect
 go pee in your butt you know I just like speaking person in my response is just too like I guess add it gives him measured skepticism to anything I see on the internet and and I think it is what one thing as interesting as you see it really heightens the value of these media institutions that you know New York Times or Washington Post whatever these institutions that have this built in fact checking out there was a. Of time where I was like who needs this fact-checking stuff like just you know shoot-first-ask-questions-later now I am realizing that there is a real place for institutions that take their back seriously right right yeah and I'm a journalist or former journalist myself I appreciate that a lot I used to write for Forbes Magazine between 2006 and 2012 and the I remember the editing process they're very fondly there were a lot of
 steps of checks and a couple of editors would read what you wrote and the the more outrageous or the more you know controversial your statement is more surprising your statement is more scrutiny it got from the editors and they always ask for additional evidence even if it didn't go in the article they wanted to see it themselves on their desk to to be assured that it was legitimate so yeah that that kind of weight is is incredibly important and that is specially because all humans tend to you know believe the things they want to believe so if you're on Facebook and you see something that supports your political point of view and it's just really fun but but totally implausible you know there's a good chance that you'll be able to leave it because it's just so gratifying to believe it and the internet is tuned to provide these things right especially social media is is is to
 provided not just because of the echo chamber effect where we tend to be friends with people who agree with us but also because the platforms themselves actually tune the the news feeds to give you stuff that you want to click on so they're optimized for engagement and outrage is very very engaging journalist you have thought about media a lot what do you think of this conversation on Facebook like what is it okay for Facebook to just optimized for engagement or does Facebook have responsibilities to break down filter bubbles Service news that we don't necessarily want to see to police fake news more severely is there a responsibility there I think Facebook does have some responsibility to clean up the way that it distributes the stuff and I'm not sure that it goes all the way to you know out right
 I filtering the kinds of lynx the people can share or shadowbanning them which which Facebook is extremely good at doing I think I think beginning with a little bit of disclosure or more disclosure would help a couple of years ago Facebook noticed that there were a bunch of sites generally right-wing sites that were you know publishing articles like you know house initiates impeachment proceedings against Obama and you know patently false headlines and news sites claims to be satire but they were sort of tuned to to produce unfunny satire that would just get sort of the the far-right reaches of the political Spectrum excited and they got millions of chairs and tons and tons of traffic so that that was the birth of the the satire label that you sometimes see on on Facebook and it apply
 to the onion which is transparently satire as well as these kind of content Farms that call themselves satire but they're really just you know Distributing fake news that they get people excited and gets them lots of Patriots question about your journalistic nature so doing this show I'm transition from programming a fair bit as engineer to posting a podcast full-time I don't write code anymore and it distances me from the experience of being an engineer is it hard to think like maybe I'm missing certain things because I don't experience that anymore and perhaps it's still to my interviews in a certain way do you think about that at all as somebody who has you know as far as I know you don't code much yourself these days and correct me if I'm wrong but like how do you decide decide you think that distorts your
 ability to interview Engineers that's really good question I actually do try to program as much as possible I'm I'm a self-taught programmer I majored in math in college and but didn't have any formal programming training and while I was at Forbes I made an effort to to really learn some programming skills and I applied those by developing a lot of like interactive graphics and stuff like that and now my programming sort of long-term programming priority is to get into neural networks and deep learning so I'm I'm not doing a lot of like small demonstration projects with tensorflow which is really exciting and doing that programming is giving me a lot of insight it's gone into my work and into the conversations that I have with people but I think the fundamental practice of interviewing people and an understanding a field
 is that you find a authorities whom you trust and ask them a lot of questions and so I have you know some insight from the fact that I program myself but I think I have a lot more insight from hanging out with with really bright credible articulate practitioners who are able to spend a lot more time programming and developing applications then then I ever could I think that's the core skill of Journalism is developing sources who you trust and and you know asking them questions and and staying in touch with them and having them help you understand what's going on
 I certainly admire your approach of going for spending some spare time tinkering with neural networks if there was something that I was going to take her on in my spare time actually programming I would be doing I would in fact I really thought about doing exactly what you said what you're saying what are the insights that you've gone because I mean like I've heard I've done shows about tensorflow event shows about different machine learning Frameworks in trying trying to get a grasp of of the stuff and I can make you know some statements like what the statement I made about deep learning okay it's this this procedure for extracting features where unit in you like to do this labeling as much as you can get the Unica just use Virtual lots of data to label that been her she know what that means in terms of implementation so what are some of the inside that you gave her actually tinkering with that stuff that's a great question there are a few different category
 seven sites that I've really enjoyed one of them is that it's illuminated some of the abstract math that I learned in college and this is this is something that's happened at a few points so you know taking economics classes and reading about economics really illuminated calculus for me and its applications and and and its significance and developing Graphics really illuminated geometry farming in and trigonometry and I was like you know and anytime I I created it an interactive graphic I'd find myself like writing out in pencil these trigonometric Transformations sine squared plus cosine squared equals one of the stuff like that that you know that you might remember from from like a high school geometry and so it really illuminated that in and brought it to life right now deep learning is Illuminating and enlightening linear algebra for me which was always my least
 favorite part of of my math degree and it's it's really really gratifying it's also stitching together some statistics for me in and helping me see The Intercept some aspects of a kind of regressions as well it in terms of applying and I'm really fascinated by content generation with neural networks in so I'm playing with some stuff there and I've I've stumbled across some interesting properties of neural networks for instance that if you you can you don't train a neural network to recognize digits this the digits 0 through 9 and and then it's possible to create by sort of reverse engineering the network an image that looks to the network like it's an image of the number 3 but to a human is just an image of noise so you're kind of like explaining the
 you know the heuristics that the neural network has developed as it's getting trained as with humans you know you can trick humans in exactly the same way in like Daniel Kahneman wrote wrote about this you know take advantage of the of the heuristic Corners that the humans develop and insert a trick them you can do the same thing with with neural networks so as we drop your clothes given that you're a fellow podcaster I'd love to hear what what are your thoughts on podcasting where is it going to be unrelated to software engineering but everybody is listening to a podcast right now so they may be curious I mean what are your podcast listening habits where do you think the industry is going I heard Stephen Dubner recently say that he thinks were in Peak podcast whatever that means but he's a you know he's at he even be invest heavily in podcast so it was interesting to hear him say that but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the industry yeah it's it's an
 history I'm really interested in as a practitioner and a listener it strikes me as a very young industry in a lot of ways and and I can kind of understand why Dubner would say we might be a peek podcast now just culturally it feels like podcasts are much more influential than they were a year ago it's it's a bit like how people reacted to Botts by saying like a boxer over everyone is talking about them on the other hand if you look at the amount of advertising spending that's going into podcast it's just a miniscule fraction of of you know television and web advertising and a miniscule fraction of terrestrial radio advertising so there's a lot of room for growth in order to grow their need to be some technological changes as you know as a podcaster podcast statistics are just the most primitive thing you have you ever seen right I mean podcast analytics it's there from the Stone Age
 and so big advertisers are unwilling to spend a lot on podcasts when the measurement tools are so poor although I just did a bunch of shows about advertising fraud and one of the downsides of having a lot of analytics you got a lot of fraud in the analytics advertises were illuminated on what they were actually spending their money on rather than phony numbers that they're getting fed by the advertising agency they would consider podcast were seriously no totally in and you know podcast sir are a very special thing that the companies that do I advertise on podcasts just love it you know because they associate their brands with the podcast hosts and podcast listeners have these very intimate relationships with the with the hosts of the programs that they listen to so big
 air mattresses on that meter box yeah they're getting a lot out of it in and they're paying a lot of money for it to the the cpm's on podcasts are way higher than the cpm's on any websites so it's it feels like it's a bit of a constrained market right now constrained by by the the desert of supply of content and buy the measurement and an ad placement tools available as early it's a really hairy issue to write because in order to improve the metrics you would need to change the clients that podcast listeners use and apple who kind of you know sits astride the market and and decides these things hasn't indicated any interest in changing the podcasting client and iOS
 efforts like you know NPR has its own podcasting app that you can download and certainly they're getting much more valuable data out of that than they would out of you know that is for the iTunes mechanisms well you know the the train you wouldn't actually have to be that dramatic I thought about this a bit and like all the all the Apple would have to do is change the podcast app so that it does analytics recordes analytics whether or not the phone is online for how the user is consuming a downloaded episode and then uploads that information next time it's connected to a network right right yeah so that it does some self-reporting like podcast or just downloaded automatically or they're streamed and those two things count as the same thing whether or not you listen to the entire episode whether or not you listen through the mid-roll weather now you listen to the second mid-roll
 and show so the analects don't really go in detail basically because the analytics begin where begin and end at the point at which you are you have a list that you have downloaded it basically Yan and that's why the only companies that are willing to advertise on podcasts are companies that are doing customer acquisition and have kind of a built-in mechanism for understanding the efficacy of those ads right so you know go to naturebox.com and type in the code software engineering daily for you know 10% off your first order so they're able to measure it if we don't yet see brand advertising on on podcast swear it's like you know Mercedes-Benz brings you this podcast and the tells you that it's set it's a great car and the most luxurious thing you've ever seen her whatever you know cuz they have no way of measuring the impact of of that ad
 twit network the twit network has gotten Ford and Visa oh well yeah yeah they get some brand Advertiser so it's interesting possible but yeah I don't know we'll see thanks for trying to show I'm a big fan of the podcast members super valuable to me and I liked bought day a lot as well thanks so much Jeff it's really been a pleasure I'm a fan of your podcast too and it's it's it's a real treat to come out of myself
 software engineering daily is having our first ever meet up in San Francisco January 11th at galvanized if you live in the Bay Area and you listen to software engineering daily please come check it out I would love to meet you or to have some awesome speakers with Pete hunt who was one of the early members of the react JS team who is now the CEO of smite haseeb Qureshi who has been one of the most popular guests on software engineering daily preethi kasireddy who has written about her career transition from Venture Capital to software engineering via coding bootcamp each one of these speakers is going to give an awesome talk and I hope you can make it January 11th at Galvanize in San Francisco you can sign up on meetup.com you can also find the link on the software engineering Daily website software engineering daily.com I really hope to see you there

 Rahman Chowdhury works on artificial intelligence at Accenture remind welcome to software engineering daily machine learning technology improve both in quality and inaccessibility let's talk about the improving quality of Technology first how has the workflow of a data scientist or a machine learning program easier in The Last 5 Years in question so I feel like quality and accessibility almost go hand-in-hand because there is so much open source out there and free tools to train yourself on different models and techniques and we can move a lot faster it has improved the quality because when you come into a project you're not starting from scratch have a ton of resources available on the internet if not on your own team I'm so I think there's a few things happening here when we have more tools available to us even before we become a data scientist
 so we enter data science jobs that are armed to data science has matured more as a field so instead of coming in and being one of the first data scientist or the first data scientist you now have a team to rely on and there's a lot to be sad about seniority even if the other person's only been there 2 years ahead of you because there's a few things happening here so there are a number of Trends there are a number of tools that are improving things but data cleaning as I understand is still a persistent problem is the problem that's been confounding data scientist for as long as we had data science is the cleaning going to become easier or is this something that is always going to be a challenge for data scientist I see both ends of it so I'll give you a bit of insight right now I'm on a project that requires the imitation of scientific documents and
 there is no machine way to do that so literally right now I am sore seeing about 10 analyst for about 500 hours of work and do you know I've apologized profusely because they're about to spend the next 500 hours downloading articles off of el Savior and Jay store and tagging them into a spreadsheet or some sort of a file so that part of it will never go away so data cleaning specifically I think will improved greatly and this is where AI comes in there's some really fascinating tools out there one that I've seen taking off in more complex data sets and dealing with my multidimensionality there are applications where they're using topographical map being and you can if you imagine mapping your data set on multiple Dimensions the way a map looks so add that to VR technology now we're seeing the capability to literal
 walk into your data set so you put on a VR headset you have your topographical map and of your data you are seeing your data points in Multan in three dimensions and then you can look over there and say oh what is that outlier literally touch the outlier see what the point is or turn your data around to see it from a different perspective so it's in all of the sounds like magical story time but I promise you these are things that exist or will exist in the very near future at at the Consumer Electronics Expo or being useful
 I think I'd be very useful to be able to visualize your data there's something very compelling about a good visual and spotting outliers it's actually something I focused on quite a bit as scientist and a nice offer from the same thing we approved visuals as he you slept together a bar chart at the end of your analysis right since being exposed to D3 I've gotten really an education on good visuals and how they can change your outcome or how they can change how you perceive your data on or how they can give you insights you could just buy you know running analyses on your data so I absolutely think you could be useful so yes that is a very scalable solution at maybe a bigger company or a company that is very deep in an outlier detection or data analysis before the average data scientist I didn't get a cleaning will become easier for many reasons one we have more people coming in today to sign some more hands are touching data
 21 problem I saw in my earliest date of science job is that we hadn't we as like a Aztec had only thought of data in terms of storage not usage so we had tons and tons of data and we have 10 years of historical data at but they were all web logs and they were just some stored not in a not easily accessible format you have to put on a you know hdfs system on top of that and even then it wasn't literally the date it was not structure in a way that made it easier understandable I think I'm moving past that so we're getting more Savvy on how we store our data so they the science one point I was all about big data and you know literally people would ask how much data you had and we quickly came to realize it was absolutely meaningless if you could not get good quality results out of your data so now there's more focus on the air quality in accessibility so I think they the cleaning will improve
 frankly because I will be less cleaning to do it was interesting initiatives around open data sets I had a conversation with Lauren Hoffman a while ago and he's working on a company called safegraph and their goal is to make data sets more open and accessible and safe and perhaps anonymized in case you were needs to be anonymized how big of a potential opportunity is this I think it reduces barriers significantly to have data sets accessible to different people kygo has done a lot for helping data scientist a non-traditional backgrounds shine and that is based on having these days has provided to them that do frankly very interesting things like detecting a seizure based on MRI scans I have is that so I think I'd be open data movement is critical to a feels like they to science where people can come from all different backgrounds and as a result it's hard to
 identify a good data scientist oh how do you do that you you have to build a portfolio projects you can only do it if you have good data one thing I will touch on some part of the work I do it Accenture is on responsible and ethical responsible and ethical AI so I'm really focused on what you just mentioned anonymizing get up it's more than just anonymizing you can use data sets in many different ways to identify people another part of having open data which again I'm all for is making sure it's representative of the sample you were trying to talk about so you know not to start driving into the holy no bias algorithms thing but we do see outcomes that you know are subject to all the ism sexism racism and that's because the data is trained on is an adequately representative so for example there was one to determine the outcome of
 beauty pageant and because it had only been trained on Western ideals of beauty it had all the white women is beautiful and I all of them but people who are traditionally Western in a white looking as beautiful a darker skin women is not beautiful I'm not justifying your data that doesn't mean your algorithm hates black people it just does a fly in your data and needs to be either recognize or address in open date when you are continuously deploy software you need to know how your code changes affect user traffic around the world app ecosystem helps companies with their end user experience focusing on availability and performance test monitor and optimize your application with a pika system with a pika zebra tester a pika load test and a pika synthetic you can sure the your apps an api's work for all your users at any time around the world a big is he

 what typical strategy for how company develops a model in house in maybe the research section of the company and then deployed it because this is a problem or an opportunity depending on how you look at it that I've heard quite often as you have a data scientist who is hacking around on Monday to set and they're trying to solve particular problem like let's build a better model for how we serve ads two people for example and then they'll build the model in house as a research project and then and then once they're ready to say okay this is something we need to deploy its kind of an estate where it's not easily Deployable like maybe they wrote it in a particular language where are there using static data and it's not straightforward how to deploy it have you seen this as an issue and how have you seen it be solved actually at 9
 stop that's what that is a model I built you just mentioned targeted media is I work for a company called quotient and my team won an award at strata Hadoop for targeted media model that we developed and is very cool we used Shopper Behavior you know from the way people shopped at places like Safeway and Walgreens and other companies to identify an individual and Target them with literally the things that we thought they would buy and it was more than just so you've bought these complementary Goods it was taking into account things like product life cycle so for example you time to buy laundry detergent every 6 weeks if I knew you buy laundry detergent 5 weeks ago guess what I'm talking to Target anyway that's right and then also for maybe dryer sheets as well so I have experience in that it was back then I was programming more and are now I do more python agree that's not easily Translate
 well I think tools like spark really help dealing with streaming data so the a big consideration I had to have was latency of my model data accessibility and how well it would translate to scale which were not considerations I've ever had to do my background on my PhD in political science and quantitative social scientist but all the date I've ever used even if it was in a lot of data never had to programmatically be scaled I was just worried about a one-time output so it's a different mindset when you have to consider streaming data as you mentioned you have to worry about the latency of your model and then you have to really get clean and precise about having efficient code which was not something I was accustomed to doing Monday night will add is that I know it's very popular to want to do everything in real time and streaming data but it is worth a consideration on what the value add is versus the amount of work necessary to
 able to handle streaming data you may not need it so you know you might have an example which maybe day old data would be absolutely fine and much easier to access and trying to get live streaming data so it's it's worth it to take a step back and think about all of your options before I just driving into the coolest spark so it should be pragmatic statement to make can you help us generalize that what are the cases where a batch procedure is good enough let's go get a really good question I think if customers are doing a lot of actions on your interface so you know it say we're talking about a website if you can just base your recommendations on what similar customers are doing within the last let's say 24 hours maybe it's for you know shopping you might be able to get away with not using
 data you can use customer preferences within last 24 hours if you're trying to do something maybe like weather prediction or something where the person needs the answer at the moment and you wanted to be curated and customized and you might lose people as a result so maybe streaming music or streaming media you probably want that to be real time I need to know what you just listen to to know what you want to listen to next or what else I should recommend to you but something I honestly you know maybe I'm wrong in my perception but most brick-and-mortar translations to web like so for example stores could probably do with just with not having to go the streaming route to implement batch versus stream why why is that so hard because I think of streaming data set is one example of a Time coming in you just got up
 Speedo run that through your system versus bat you just have that running once per day where you have all of your examples explain why streaming is Harter stamping is only hard because most companies especially ones outside of Silicon Valley and especially ones that are trying to scale Solutions are not equipped in terms of hardware and software to do it anywhere little bit spoiled in Silicon Valley and that we're used to be small companies that just jump right in and invest in spark from the get-go but if you are an older company that has had data stored word for many years and they are you heading to tease a system and that's how you used to access your data you're coming on board with data science maybe in the Last 5 Years there's a lot of sausage making what happens in the back and it's it's that it's very pretty so the difficulty really often lies with the solutions you have at hand and not
 all companies in fact most companies are not yet there to deal with streaming data cleanly that being said the the adoption rate is you know expedite companies are moving ridiculously fast and I'm frankly impressed at global companies and their willingness to adopt things like open source tools and invest in tools and programs are only a few years old with that's not the norm with it companies can you explain what is going on in the inner workings of those big companies the weather for talking about the quote on quote AI strategy that a big company might be adopting or just maybe the conversations that is CTO is having in terms of K we need these new technologies do some specific new technologies maybe not with a broad overarching ambitious artificial intelligence strategy
 but just being a piecemeal Technologies talk about how these conversations are going on in the big companies Joe raciti O-level they're not a kid fresh out of college so while younger people we might all get excited we might all Buy in fully with AI these people have seen so many technological quote-unquote revolutions and by the way I fully believe that this is the AI Revolution is a technological Revolution but from the perspective of maybe I see you sitting in Texas or you know not in the heart of Silicon Valley they've heard this field before they heard about sap they heard it about web 1.0 so they're here the lake alright you don't we see it's doing stuff but you know it's very what can I do for me and will it actually revolutionize the other thing I've seen and this is true of date of
 implementing data science in general it's almost scary to dream that big one thing I used to do it my first data science job is talk to our strategy and insights folks who are not quantitative and ask them we just for their wish list of Mike give me you're ridiculous wish list that's actually how the micro-targeting project was born that we people are not even sure of what the potential is so you know and like I said people at the sea level leave they've heard this conversation they get pitch Tito the next day of the best thing since sliced bread quite often part of it is getting them on board with an understanding and appreciating the AI in data science Revolution I think they are starting to see it there are some really great industry examples of people look at Tesla's one who bears and other car I've ever owned and frankly like you don't
 keys and I just like put my hand on the door and it opens and then it knows who I am and it does I'll just go to the store no I didn't get it I don't have a good way of charging a car where I am so I got a hybrid yeah so I have a BMW i-330 yeah I 3:30 I'm really not a car person it's kind of hilarious I'm just talking just like I want a hybrid I want a car that has tack in it and you know anyways like I was saying it is hard for ctOS to see the magic that we see on the ground there really high level they get pitched you know these impossible Dreams all the time and part of my job is to help them understand that this is the real deal AI is going to transform the economy of just about every industry even if it's an industry you wouldn't think of even if it's an old industry and Binoo
 OPI often refer to Tesla and car companies as a really good example it was previously impossible for a company to come out of nowhere and totally upend the car industry it just it just didn't happen and all the German car manufacturers were pretty much caught snoozing while Elon Musk came in with Tesla and dominated the elect electric car park it is funny scene the term artificial intelligence really start to enter the public vernacular and even more recently we're really trying to see people talk about what we do about Automation in more practical terms receive Bill Gates talking about a robot tax for example are these conversations permeating the less technologically literate companies and you take a company like maybe a big insurance company or a big cpg company do they
 get that I mean I guess if you're having these conversations with them about like look at that thing it's this is a term that we are going to do they were using to define the output of machine learning processes once they are put in place and deployed and are assisting you in a in a measurable fashion do these companies believe it and an do they convey that throughout their company or is it still just small Pockets within the company and then the rest of the company doesn't really get it but it's so I that's an excellent question that's one of the things we're working on we do something call the maturity assessment and a large part of that is understanding if your company's even ready to implement a I so your CTO could be all about it but if you don't have good management and I called him doers you don't have the doors in place you can have all the pipe dreams you want things won't happen so it is absolutely key to get everybody
 the company on poorly at least key leadership roles who will be implementing projects will understand it so there's there's a lot of different levels right now I think most people are very nice and level where they are starting to do something called RPA robotic process automation so that's things like robots and unpack boxes who do very very manual tasks we need to move that forward but that's not that's why I say I would be something like you know it can algorithmically determine the most efficient way to pack a box by itself and then go Pack set box and then learn from provided to it about where things are stored in Captain how much stock is left Etc that's when a eye starts to come in so I agree there needs to be there different levels of Vino Hardware data Computing ability and also just psychological Readiness so that goes into the second part you mentioned about this whole Bill Gates tax thing so
 so I put my clinical science hat on so tell me what have a tax on robots right now we taxed based on a person right so we pay less an income tax but that's not so cuz I'm also David scientist I want things quantifiable so what are we doing then if we're taxing a robot are we making some sort of robot to human conversion rate so how many people does this robot equal and charging accordingly let's say you have a robot so what algorithm like I said that determines the Abyssal path to pack box and there is a robotic arm boxes is that one robot or two but let's say that one algorithm controls 100 robotic arms is that a hundred one robots or is that one robot so I have problems with how one would quantify robots and what it boils down to just a really interesting thing so one of my rolls at Accenture is we're trying to understand as part of the responsible ethical a eyes
 psyche and psychology in creating a world that is integrated with artificial intelligence and part of that understanding is realizing how selfish absorbed human beings are we imagine robots replacing humans we literally think that it will look like the factory of today but just with robots standing there instead of humans that is not even remotely what it's going to look like and we don't even think about things like scaling and productivity so back to the tax example so if we are creating this robot to human conversion rate in taxing appropriately doesn't that mean that we're going to tax companies a lot because of robot can probably do the work of 5 10 15 people 24 hours a day so it's you know maybe a better measurement is productivity level not literally number of robots right or some sort like doing some sort of conversion so it gets it
 turkey I think it's a little bit of a naive approach and it reflects our human self-absorption as animals we we just we think we're the center of everything we designed everything to be you know about us right so what is it now mean about to get overly philosophical what does it now mean that we have these machines that can mimic how we think but also move faster never have to sleep you know they don't have family responsibilities how does that make us feel when interacting with such a machine was talking about this robot taxico because a robot automate what a warehouse worker did we have to start taxing the robot at a rate that the human would be somewhat equivalent to compensate that lost human availability because OK Bill why didn't you text yourself when you
 I made email widespread and and you know prevented the mail boy or the mail girl in in the mail room at a at a business back in the day from having a job anymore why did you text yourself on that it's just it just it feels like a really weird slippery slope and that's why I'm surprised that you would say that and it said maybe it's a more realistic way of looking at things than basic income I guess it I mean from you if you keep it on your political science had do you think is that a reasonable because I think the basic income stuff is been the most compelling to me from a logical perspective but from a political perspective J even just that term basic income sounds like it is going to have zero velocity in making it through our political system I think it would ever make it to our current political
 system but I don't know what he was trying to get it maybe he was just trying to address this fear people have of robots replacing jobs and you know us not being able to catch up and in there is a lot of fear but I think it again I was using the word naive it's it's a very human-centric view of what a I means what I see it meaning is making boring tasks automated so that the human being can now do more interesting things so I can give you an example from some of the work we're doing some to work I'm actually with her corporate citizenship group so we have a nonprofit and they provide re-skilling tutorials and methods for people who are trying to get to move from a more manual job that will be replaced by AI to a more technical job or role that will be more insulated
 so as long as they are trying to reschedule they got a job coach this is a human being and the program is wildly successful but they're having problems scaling because to scale they literally need more bodies this is not a hardware or software solution this is a we need to hire more people solution so how can I help if we build an interview chatbot that is that uses a really good machine learning algorithm in the background and it learns from all of its interactions that only can it do the interview process better than a human being could because it learns from globally every interview that it gives with anybody but it also frees up that job coach to do other things maybe focus on interview skills or in a resume or Jitters or nerves are we going to talk to them through or maybe they can be on the person can graduate and get a job with fewer one-on-one sessions and then that person can see
 the job coach can see more people so you know there is this very zero-sum game view of what a guy means it's either me or the robot you know but I really see it as more symbiotic that robots will free up a lot of tasks that would make our lives more interesting right I mean it's funny when you watching or shows that take place in the 50s near like oh my God they're just sitting there like on a train going from like I don't know New York to Philadelphia and he's going to take forever and then we think how great society is now because things are more efficient right I don't have to wait to order a pair of shoes and get it in 5 to 7 Days Amazon sends me or Zappa's will send it to me tomorrow I think it's fabulous and yet we're approaching the say I efficiency improvement with fear and skepticism so it's it's an interesting balance I think it part of it is a misperception and the marketing of it or the the framing of it as is
 are some game that needs to be dispelled software engineering daily so we can talk a little bit about engineering the excitement around tensorflow is palpable the seems to be the machine learning framework that is an analog to perhaps react js on the John the JavaScript job this is the worst analogy of ever made but intermittent terms of the network effect of how many people are getting involved with this together with the big company marshalling all this energy behind it tensorflow is somewhat analogous to to an open source project like reactive is back my Facebook and Google uses it massively internally
 what are the big appeals of tensorflow me I was just at the tensorflow dev Summit and there was so much everybody there was just super smart and like clearly cutting a cutting-edge person so why is there so much excitement behind tensorflow what does it do right so that's really is what makes a possible and that's what everybody's excited about tensorflow provides a very very easy to implement and use it's just a really that's really easy to use and Implement to start to get started with and develop more sophisticated neural-net so going back to her question earlier about you know streaming data and difficult and I was talking about how we have these like investments in Technologies and it's hard to move tensorflow does pretty much cut through all of that right so it's it can be all in the cloud your data can be streaming or data can be in
 Cloud you can spin up an instance in minutes I've taught tensorflow tutorials where students came in and said I forgot to install tensorflow you can do it on your home computer which is fascinating right just to be able to two-wheel something with such power from your home computer and I can get you from not having it installed to running your basic in a neural net in 15 minutes is revolutionary it's also because of tensorboard it's easier to visualize to explain to people who are not technically I think one very key hurdle that tensorflow overcomes is the translation from a more engineering data scientist crowd to a more business-focused cloud or somebody who needs to put something into a PowerPoint deck a lot of data science is taking your engineering skills and translating it for people who are not data Savvy tensorflow is an X
 very approachable way of doing that for managed machine learning services so Google's Cloud machine learning is sort of a managed version of tensorflow the main opportunities out here around that are the auto-scaling but I can imagine other things so like you talked about tensorboard essentially being this sounds like a dashboard for data scientists to work with or or maybe people who are more on the business side what were the opportunities around a hosted service for machine learning students working at the biggest tech companies who told me that they are code anymore as a design to set that nobody there codes unless you are a pure PhD research scientist who's building the things like tensorflow and what that does is democratize data science
 which has both its pros and cons so the the visualization I think is really useful they're also going back to her question about data cleaning there are also tools out there that help you explore your data what that means is you know just too quick cross-sections of your data map it by time you know find anomalies just by visualizing your date and all these different ways and that's translating more and more into machine learning so I say it has pros and cons for two reasons data science is not just about running a code to hang under there's so much thoughtfulness that needs to go into it and I'm not saying that you need to have a Ph.D or that you need to have this super sophisticated background in math but at the very least you need to understand what is going into your model weather this in the best model for the data you're using for the question you have and this is a very human part where again I think AI is not going to replace people
 Xin Xin algorithm the computer is do not understand contact so key to being a data scientist is not just making good code but implementing it in the real world and the real world is a messy place so unless you have context to understand the real world that your algorithm will be applied into and be able to adjust your algorithm accordingly you won't be successful so I always say that the engineers use Geico garbage in garbage out the thing that's worse than Geico at least you know it's garbage right only thing worse than that is like you've no idea what you're doing and it goes in and then something reasonable looking comes out and you know you're like oh I have 98% accuracy and you should run with it and if this is actually happened I've taught enough data science to know that and actually even even in my poli-sci program the first thing everybody wants to do is make what I call a kitchen sink model and
 everything like you know at a the size of my shoe and what the weather was yesterday and that affects the stock market's next week right but it's true that they're there is a desire to do that and you overcomplicate because there's so much thoughtfulness so while I like the idea that you don't necessarily have to be in a very Advanced programmer to implement data science I worry that making it easier and easier will make people make naive solutions that aren't suited for their needs we just had said and now I'm on the show who wrote an article that you may have read called why machine learning is hard and he talked about all these different taxis for debugging a machine learning model that exists whether you're talking about data cleaning or accuracy or any of these other
 taxis because getting a machine learning model write a service objective problem this is it good enough maybe it's good enough maybe it's not good enough it's not this binary either it works or doesn't think you have in a lot of web apps I can imagine a world in the not-too-distant future where we've got all these machine learning model sitting around doing work at a company and they're good enough but nobody really knows how they work their Justice black box that's you know somebody develop 5 years ago and then you know we don't really know how it works maybe it works maybe it doesn't is it a possible future to you what's going to happen with a I especially if it starts to touch other Industries and starts to be more than just fun toys protect people is government going to get involved and it will have to because they I will touch things like industries that have unions and unions may push back and then the government will have to get involved so the EU zerei
 passing regulation other way ahead of of the US in passing regulation about data privacy data security and it is not long before we start talking and start implementing tactical solutions to creating explainable AI so I a AAA conference was sick last week and the stupid MIT released typically Black Box algorithm that was more explainable so we went to tell you intermediate steps and then that's something I've seen a lot of being worked on and whoever is able to crack that will open up the use of AI into so many Industries in there are also some Industries in which you literally cannot use black model Black Box models legally so I think of Finance as one of them you cannot use a Black Box model and black box is defined very broadly for them you cannot use Black Box models to do things like credit risk analysis
 Toledo offer that you know to to make us at interest rates or make offers two people they they need their bottles to be fully explainable so it is already legally regulate it against and the key is to open it up so I think it's something that companies are thinking about which is I guess maybe an upside to all the AI fear-mongering that's going on

 I didn't realize that you could not make a Black Box model in finance and that sounds like over-regulation to me but but I don't know if so let's let's talk about that mean I would love to hear your opinions about that a little bit more we can go to the stuff I mean it seems like a black box model for 8 for credit risk should be fine I mean certainly it would have some discriminatory you could have the potential for discriminatory based on race stuff occurring but those will be missed opportunities that somebody else could pick up this seems like a problem that the market would solve for you think that type of Regulation deserves to be in place I absolutely think it does it's not very it's not that easy to start a bank and give people loans if you are talking about some of the largest
 banks in the country did not systematically denying African Americans or recent immigrants loans based on a Model that they themselves cannot explain I think that's that's a problem because human agency plays a huge a huge role and even said that was the cock so if you know of weapons of mass destruction Kathy O'Neal's book that was a big hit last year I have my feelings on the way we talk about these kinds of things bias algorithms Etc but said to touch on your weather regulation is needed or not I think so yes it's dinner we don't have zero barriers to entry in some of these markets and finances are really good example while there is some disruption happening in finance with a lot of these smaller startups that are doing things like creating your credit score based on potential rather than your history they're not market dominance and you worry about people not being able to do things
 I got a basic credit card because of some algorithm that is purely black box and cannot explain its of reasoning question what's your perspective on that how far are we from General artificial intelligence and are we close enough to start thinking about how we prevent the general AI from turning us all into paper clips
 because it's going to be a singularity cousin that sucks my hands together and put my poly sign Pat back on I think that and it's an important distinction and while it may sound like semantics it's not semantics word choice when we talk about things like biased algorithms is very important so a biased algorithm to a statistics person means something very very specific that is not what we talk about when people in the late person talks about a buys algorithm they talk about an algorithm having all the isms that's not what it means it mathematically for another device so using the layperson exclamation so I think that's how it started because sad speak we will say bisagra is biased to be late person here we understand by assuming something different and that's how all this talk of bias algorithms started now algorithms are not alive they are not they do not have free will they do not
 do things that we have not told him to do so by using the term biased algorithm in the sunset is implementing isms we are removing human agency from the equation by using those words were acting as if it's the algorithms fault and not the person's fault which is why I think there should be regulation on things like black box algorithms because at the end of the day it's the person or the company implementing the solution to the algorithm and the people creating the algorithm not the algorithm itself that is at fault and that's that's really important even though like I said it may sound like some because I think that is what's driving a lot of our fear of AI because we're already starting to talk about algorithms as if they are alive as if they are capable of independent thought they're not and when we use this language that anthropomorphizes in a iron algorithm where we're going down that slippery slope of then say well.
 robots will dominate the world and we're just going to be there text it you go from like 02 Terminator in an instant it's really funny and then we're nowhere near getting there how are you so sure of that because you know you look at these things like this paper that came out of deepmind recently where they're talking about transfer learning from game to game and you can see this potentially being the N equals one that if they figure out how to frame the problem correctly they could induct upon that and get to something where or you can transfer now no okay we will figure out how to do transfer learning from pong to Cruisin USA you know maybe you go from there and you said okay now we we figured out how to do transfer lane from Cruisin USA to cooking and then from cooking to driving real cars in from driving real cars to fight
 the Army and I can imagine this going very fast and I think this is this is why I don't fault people for starting to sound the alarm now and say what start to think about this because if we don't think about it and we get it wrong then it could be the end of humanity so when there's algorithm goes from learning you know pong to Cruisin USA to cooking two fighting there is usually a human component either introducing it or exposing it to something new that's also the human component that could turn it off and stop it I think we forget that there is there still such a human ate that there's a seal again that the human agency aspect to it one thing I do agree with is that there is a huge psychological impact that is already having on humanity and it's understandable um or maybe a less fatalistic
 thinking about it is but you know your teammate being out in the future for whatever job you have is likely to be an AI and it will do things like suggest solutions to problems and create code or we know whatever you do and it will be a contributing member of your team so right now it and whether or not it's been a conscious decision or not all the AI we've created have been in servitude so we have these box that are only responsive if we ask it something they're not proactive we have things like roombas and they're all of these things that assist us and they serve as I even see right she will only do something when I ask her to she will not proactively tell me things people get creeped out by that so what happens when we have a eye with that level of capability again I don't think it's going to get to the point where your teammate AI is not trying to kill you I think that people will feel useless so a good example that was
 out of the medical world although I don't think it's a successful as it was being touted was a vision recognition algorithm that could identify skin cancer better than the average doctor so let's hear this doctor and you've gone through literally Decades of schooling and tons of student loans to get to a point and then now there's this and it will just say better than you can it'll tell you what your job is at what point do you feel like you lost control that that's a very feasible teacher more feasible than let's say robots all be no killing us and that's almost two more dangerous future cuz it's human beings we value feeling productive we value contribution are you going to this doctor is probably very proud of the fact that their doctor they cure people have cancer will they not feel like they're the one cheering people if a robot is now telling them that this person has cancer and that's the treatment you should give and here's how you say pimple
 then you're the one in servitude and the Machine is the one dictating I think that that's a that's a very very real consideration and understanding about Humanity we have to make it mean agree with you that the probability of the the dermatologist being obviated by technology that's a higher probability of future currents than the tail risk of Terminator however the downside weight of Terminator is potentially much higher than the downside risk of dermatologists being obviated but we don't need to go down this any further before you joined Accenture you were teaching data science at metis and I think it's a little more tangible topic what is a modern data science curriculum look like and what were you teaching in medicine
 so for the audience who made up you spell your medicines at 3 months data science bootcamp we have offices in our schools in New York which is where we started San Francisco Seattle is opening and Chicago style open and to answer your question data science curriculum is very very difficult to develop we just went through a major overhaul out during my last few months there so there was a team so it was by the way like the best job ever I love my job I don't get me wrong but it was it was just a great job for somebody of a academic teaching mindset who wants to be given free reign to have fun in data science which is why they're very it is it's a very unique skill-set to be a successful teacher there so we used to teach 6 months out of the year we did corporate Consulting for 3 months and then we had 3 months to pursue your passion project so for some people there their Corporate Quarter is sometimes been doing internal work
 all that is to say we had a team of people who literally spent 3 months revamping and Overhaulin our entire curriculum and this isn't a curriculum that is roughly two years old and not static is a fluid curriculum so if I'm you know if I'm an expert in you know so for example went when they're all nuts became big right they were not big one that is first started we had people we hired her expert and neural Nets and they created curricular for us to teach even given that it is an ongoing process of developing we still needed a team that took about 3 months to overhaul standardized and create everything I think the teaching data science is a process of constant learning not just for the students before the instructors it's it's important to learn the basics and we have a lot of pre work and we spend the first few weeks very very very careful to teach the base
 that they need and do you know that it's it's a lot about evolving with wood companies are using what people are talking about even sometimes it's just a class specific thing you may have a class that really really doing certain types of algorithms more than others and end do you have to do a lot of teaching on the Fly is definitely not for the faint of heart and when you're teaching you have no life I mean for those 6 months that you teach you are so dedicated to teaching it's it's fabulous if you love teaching like I do it's it's a great it's really rewarding of Education models that are cropping up now and I'm a really big fan of these different models whether you're talking about a boot camp sort of approach like metal or a you know things like free code camp or other more, more
 opportunities for learning things like data Sciences data Quest and then there's obviously classic University education I think some of these universities have started Outreach programs where you can maybe take classes without baby being a full-time student what are these different opportunities in how do you see them fitting together what are the pros and cons of the different approaches of engineering / data Science Education people in my life who have been able to leverage that do all the curriculum and make that into a job it's unless they had prior experience either an engineering or stats that they've got a vuse in pitching themselves as a data scientist heading in the current market is and it just it just human nature we're really bad at like not having deadline so well
 for Sarah's and things like that are fabulous it's very difficult to follow through it's also very difficult for most of them have taken which one of these online courses and then they come to my desk because you do your work in a bubble you don't have a network you still need to know other data scientist you need to springboard ideas off of each other value-add or a big girl you out of medicine is in our careers support and the students you have around you you'll often say students have gone off into a corner and talk about their projects and ideas and everybody contribute something that the other people wouldn't have thought you can't even do that so what I love about this is it starts to level the playing field but it is helpful to have that group of other data scientist or other new and young data scientist who are starting out with you so you have a way to Benchmark yourself and see if you're on the right path I think the
 traditional University model is seeing the same disruption that and keep using that word I hate that word but it is it is the right word to use the same set of a people that all Industries are going to say that you cannot just be static one reason I left Academia was I was frustrated being an ivory Tower I don't want to just talk to other people who were just like me and come up with ideas that we all thought were fabulous and then never see them see the light of day I wanted to actually make Solutions and silicon Valley's is about problem solving so it's so the boot camp bottle is great because it feels this Gap that traditional education doesn't always have and its portfolio based project-based problem-solving don't get me wrong I think I just want to taste those those valuable in many ways but this is a really good boost for people trying to shift gears and come in the industry so one thing that happens in this is me putting my account of his hat on cuz I was an economist for 7 years
 one thing about having sort of a traditional structure to your field is that these things are just signal that you went to MIT Stanford Harvard Etc or are you know RPI whatever School you went to these are just signals you're getting an employer and the signal say I am I was qualified to go to XYZ school and we value the signals as meaning something in data science that's not necessarily the case you can now come from all sorts of backgrounds and what happens at for employers it's very very difficult to parse out who would be a good data scientist I am a perfect example my background isn't clinical science I may have gone to MIT for undergrad but most of the work I've done has been in quantitative social science in there are some who would look at my resume and just throw it in the garbage can cuz their label she doesn't know how to program or whatever I have these certain perception cuz I don't have a peer engineering back on there other people
 thankfully I see it as something different and it just depends on the nature of the company and the job and and what I'm seeing being on the hiring in is that it's very very difficult to parse out a good candidate because you don't have those traditional signals to fall back on and get those signals or even valuable or indicative of anything I want to thank you for coming outside for in jail it's been really great talking to you we touched on a wide array of things I'm sure we could have talked for another hour or two so thanks for coming on

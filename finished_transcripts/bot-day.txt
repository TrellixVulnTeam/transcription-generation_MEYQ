Transcription: what day was an O'Reilly conference featuring talks from some of the leading figures in the chat bot industry which is a nascent industry but it's actually quite an exciting industry particularly for developers before I attended bought day I knew that there were lots of applications for chatbots but I didn't realize just how good the tooling had gotten it's very easy to get started with a chatbot today so if you are a developer and you have even a very basic idea for a chatbot I suggest checking out the videos from bot day as they are a great resource for how to get started with a chatbot it's really simple with the platforms and Frameworks that are now available until when I was at the conference I had a number of conversations with a Dana Salinas who hosts the women in Tech show we caught up during the coffee
brakes and and then we caught up again a few weeks after the conference to discuss our Reflections on bought day how important we thought Bots might be in the future and how developers might be interacting with the Frameworks since this breaks the typical format that I do for software engineering daily there are no ads on this episode and I'd love to hear your feedback if you like this type of conference discussion then let me know and if you don't like it let me know as well in any case if you're looking for another great podcast that talks about tech you can check out a Dana's show the women in Tech show
I'm here with the Dana Salinas the host of the women in Tech show and we are at bought day O'Reilly bought day and we are seeing some very interesting things on stage wear out near the coffee area right now so a Dana when you're when you're watching these speakers what are the questions that are coming to mind when you are seeing these people talk about Bots and conversational interfaces in these things we can be developing as software engineers
well my first thought was how do I get started with building a bot what sort of tools do I need to what extent do I need the speaker right now Beach Camera Host of the O'Reilly boss podcast variety of tools like scikit-learn numpy which we all levels have heard of and tensorflow he also mentioned don't you say I if you don't need to be so don't use a I so what are we what are Bots doing if they're not a i
I thought if you're talking to a bot that's by definition a i it's a good question but unfortunately they were so if you sent it there is a ruby
 console
 location
 what happens and you just list the list of toppings so it's it's about but it's not really a i it's just listing you a menu procedural Ruby on Rails for building chatbots yet is there a super simple like way to get started and do chatbots as a developer is The Purge typical example of something that really lowered the barrier to entry for somebody that wants to get started building a web app many people built their first web app with Ruby on Rails because it's so easy you just like rails new whatever get started and I'm wondering if there's the equivalent of the barrier lowering application framework for chatbots recant a new chat bot Pizza by and then you just get started and super easy they didn't mention a specific type of framework like ruby-on-rails what what he said was about Jensen which is a for topic modeling for a child but so
 what he said was that with this one you can get up and running pretty quickly for modeling speech or something like that a big tensorflow though even though it's been out just for a year or something yeah I was actually used to do to build these cuz I have a framework that does the Texas know where that the humanists speaking you received a response and then you respond to it somehow but then you also need some sort of back-end system it's processing the interaction and making the overall system wiring is that DD like multiple sets of tools where you have tensorflow that's doing that back end learning and then you have something else on the front end that's just serving requests
 that's what it sounds like because tensorflow is mostly for a deep learning and one of the things that they mention is that now you can have it as a service or something if you don't want to host your own country for the service yeah this is Google's thing
 okay but I think that that's just a big learning Fortune
 do you have a cell phone so it's like you have a butt and you can use so you know the the slack framework for the Microsoft bot framework but like I mentioned before it can be without a I even have a box without a I so this is just like there's a fully just plugging in the eye to your butt which is specifically deep learning
 okay now where we talk about these different things we have a eye with machine learning we have deep learning give any idea how these things break down what is the Venn diagram between these three terms does machine Mario rap with overlap with deep learning overlaps with a I or are these disjoint things
 well recently what I was reading aloud with Tommy never slept work with hunter green on from Google
 system that they prototype using both deep learning and machine learning so even though for their specific use case which I'm not going to talk in detail stuff on your answer even though for the use case which
 deep learning was more effective it was like 98% accurate machine learning was 96% accurate but they describe deep learning on some black box and in machine learning they could actually see the relations between the features like when they were building on was using web performance metrics to find relations between nose and a bounce rates and conversion rates play some deep learning is just a black box to them right this is consistent with what I've heard where you have deep learning is just you feed it labeled examples and you have the label you have a system work out what is what is what are the features of those labels where is with machine learning you define I guess you if you don't well maybe up to label it or not exactly sure but you define the features and then you can easily see relations between those features that's what I understood relationship is not a black box
 please please tell me this is a live podcast I mean what is a live work right now will Air it later see you at Lisa from O'Reilly so we're from software engineering daily were very grateful to O'Reilly for giving us free passes are you
 but at least it's not willing to say anything okay we're going to go to the next talk now and then see what kinds of interesting questions come up at that talk
 I'm back with the Dana at Salinas were talking it and another coffee break between sessions at bought day and a how are you enjoying the session so far today her. Amir Shabazz talking about a lot of out of the bottle kids what did you think of that talk show me earlier or talk about the potential for the Ruby on Rails for Bots but it seems like where we are now it's actually broken out into a bunch of different types of services he talked about different sections of the Box stack that are broken into these different types of bought tools like you need a hosting platform you need what was it what did he say
 the three different types of tools authoring tools does authoring tools his other tools the point of the authoring tool was but maybe you can ask him in your future interview at Subway what are the big takeaways from this talk was the importance of prototyping he he mentioned a couple of
 tools to use for prototyping in the value and then you can just prevent or help mitigate having bad thoughts because you will have program at address involve Engineers involved in the look and feel of the experience and you can't even see me late you're talking to the butt by hard-coding the responses so you're going to feel also about the personality of the bod or things like that so yeah some of the ones he mentioned was a protobot but frame walking and then the Watson to give a demo EP put a YouTube video of the Watson conversational robot builder which looked like you basically classify different things as entities or free Temple you know you can make a bot that is capable of recognizing food and recognizing synonyms for food in in text format like if you said
 YouTube My understand that's a synonym with meal and lunch and what I thought was interesting about that framework the IBM Watson framework that he was talking about was it looked like something that you could build on even if you're not a developer who is it looks like a way to build very robust chat interface is even if you're not a software engineer you just basically have to understand English and what's cool about that is that
 that's more about the AI portion of what's that right so cuz he mentioned Watson Louis
 Elio is Santos y p i a I recently acquired by Google I think or wait that is another one that was the Facebook acquisition you're touching more now on the AI portion of things so that they were different than the first the Proto what can you do for prototyping and I'm a pretty big one
 so the AI platform how would you define that that's like where your defining conversational flow is when you want to have more of a conversational of flow to a higher level because he also stress towards the end that putting on the beginning is a mistake that I'm not saying that's either right or wrong but that that that was his his main statement at the end but he had an example of a team somewhere I don't know where where they said that we realize putting in the beginning was a mistake so he's he's going to Amir Amir I can buy some more of to fake it's fake and the beginning so Watson is more about when your body is going to do for complicated things or it's going to be smarter than taking a broader
 range of topics okay so that's what that was my take on it so the difference between a bought from the Chabad built for slack and his entire business built on slack where you can basically ask statsbot or stats about your business in the chat interface and I think what he was talking about was the people look from statsbot built aii into their product early on meaning they tried to build a robust chat interface into their product early on when they should have just said no let's just build this very specific spot that only answers questions about sat it doesn't try to do conversational AI this goes back to what the who was the speaker before Amir Kathy Pro was talking about how you shouldn't fake it like don't like if you're not conversational don't fake it so statsbot perhaps should not have tried to fake it
 ability to be conversational it should have just said this was more about the way that I understood you really want maybe that goes back to the importance of prototyping because you will see on the beginning do we need to invest in a i cuz those things cost more right wiring up services like Watson and I assume I'm not very familiar but that was my take on it because otherwise you're saying I did saying don't fake it where is
 what is a I in this conversation what is the definition of AI we're talking about building a body we're not even there yet but what I understand in this context is using a 9
 is that you're going to want to involve machine Learning System zornig Learning Systems so that's what they're saying we evaluate first if you're actually need it for when you want your body to be used for right see this is what's Conor to Dad for me because the systems I quit. AR and AP and the Watson conversational interface-builder whatever it's called these things are not machine learning as far as I know it's very very procedural you specify I'm building a travel bot and I'm going to specify destinations and places I'm traveling from and prices of flights and hotels and I'm not going to use machine learning I'm just going to build a flat conversational interface that's what these things like API. Ai and the Watson conversational Builder are doing
 yeah but don't they have a i in their belts like that's how they were built okay I don't know we need to follow up on that but I am not sure about that well I think it's time for the next week. Thanks Dana
 so it's been a week and a half since bad day and I wanted to talk about the last section of Bob day we previously discussed the the first two sections so let's talk about what applications were presented in the last part of body Jeff can you describe what we saw Joshua Browder who created an app called do not pay which allows you to contest parking tickets in an automated fashion so if you get a parking ticket it becomes very push button and easy to contest that you take a picture of it you answer some simple questions over a bot interface and you have contested the the parking ticket whereas before it was in it was a frustrating manual process I think you had to mail something in through snail mail and I actually thought do not pay was probably the the best example of what we've seen from a bar
 you know what it from about interface that we had something that we hadn't really seen in previous interfaces I mean other things feel sort of like just gradual changes from what we have today but this felt like a real step change no I've never seen something like it allows you to automated Lee contest a parking ticket he loves you talked about some other stuff some other applications that allow you to contest other things other legal matters that he's working on so is obviously a very inspiring story we also saw Lily Chang present about shall ice and I've been hearing about job-wise for a while it's this chat bot that Microsoft Unleashed on WeChat which is a popular Chinese chat product and anshara Weiss there were users who were engaging with the bought in a really intimate fashion they were talking to it and tell him telling it
 the most intimate thoughts they were saying I love you to the bot and that was that was interesting because it was something we do not would not see in the United States at least as far as I know no no no not in a large-scale I mean we see people probably saying I love you too bots on Ashley Madison but that's a much different story than then shall I so they were so there were some significant cultural lessons from for the Lily Chang talk about shall I send and then of course you know when when Microsoft ride to Port why is shot with the table to the dentist now famous this bought that Microsoft Unleashed on Twitter was very similar to us I think it was a very similar application in terms of how it worked how it functioned to the shall I spot but it was on Twitter and they were quite different results
 they were quite alarming anybody who has not heard of the table. I recommend going to check it out but long story short the table. Quickly became a reflection of the the racism and the big tree and the sexism the inappropriateness the aggression the hostility that are in the darkest corners of Twitter because those people latched onto today and they started messaging getting this start teaching at all the horrible things that you can you can do as a human being you do and say the human being so so today was quite a different result then shall ice even though they were the same code bases which was just an interesting reflection of of these of these things I bet anyway those are those are those who I think the two main applications that we saw where were those the only two over there other two other ones yeah those are the ones that I can remember one of the things that I also like to buy
 this last portion of the event was that previously what well we see or well I personally knew about Bots was it there used either you know I'm at work for cha tops for talking to servers restarting them and the other application that I knew about was for marketing like I'm talking to a chat bot from Domino's or Nordstrom so seeing these two for example the first one is focused heavily on the people and making accessible legal processes for free like before you would either just pay for your ticket you know without even bothering to look up the laws in the regulations of maybe it was a mistake and the sign wasn't clear that text was too small things like that so it's
 making expensive law processes to the people which I thought was was very very cool and the second one was more of the friend just talking to torbot so kind of like her the movie called her so that's why I said this does last portion was very distinct and different from what I had known and seen about butts yeah well those those purposes like for chat apps are seem very well-defined and they seem like things where it's very natural for us to think about a bot doing like restarting a server telling you that some build finished telling you what other people have done in a stand up these are somewhat linear tasks and then and then you have this stuff that's much more non-linear like thing of contesting a parking ticket as a real-world process that is probably harder to
 digitized but none-the-less Joshua Browder was able to digitize it I didn't course you have her which is like something this that's like the the big dream of a i and this is like another very hard to reach application yeah so have you thought of any interesting by applications after reflecting for a few weeks cuz like obviously we saw a wide variety of inspirational stuff there you know we saw slack Bots like the restart a server type of functionality or tell everybody in your stand up functionality and then we saw this you no more futuristic stuff like contest a parking ticket or get legal services or have a companion have you been inspired in any way by these presentations that we saw you know I think we're going to start seeing more applications hopefully in the government sector where we are making
 service is more accessible to people and things like that that's what I ain't I'm projecting to basically improving governments throughout the world and being on dating technology in the workflow for those things yeah it's funny I also saw more you know who's just after bought day I started I don't know Uber really stay there is a way that they do chat I'm in the way that they kind of update you on your trip information they improved the amount of chat that their servers have with you so this is like a consumer device where Uber Uber is always done stuff we're like oh it did send you a message your drivers on the way or your driver is outside waiting for you but they started sending me more stuff like oh your drivers caught I think they sent me something like your drivers caught in traffic and it will be a while before your driver arrives and so I thought that was
 that was a nice little window into George going to see more and more of this stuff kind of augment the current functionality we have so yeah I have a few questions I wanted to talk to you about one thing I've been reflecting on is this discussion of what actually is a i cuz I we heard people and the presentation sabate talk about the term AI in a bunch of different contexts and then I talk to somebody since then who knows a lot about this area and he and he basically said it's just like a term you should never use because it is so loaded it doesn't even mean anything what do you think about that term was one of the presenters said I was asked to talk to me to talk about you no way I with Bots would he said I'm going to talk about machine learning because yeah so it's so it was a similar perspective I think
 are these because there's still a lot of research going on and it's so we're still figuring out the building blocks of this area so it's not something that's already been to find I think that's why so a lot of most of the focus is machine learning and deep-learning you both talk specifically about those things as a hole right to like machine learning and deep-learning being basically the tools that you're using to build your end product and that's a lot more specific than a guy which AIC between Compass like the tools and the end product and everything in between machine learning and deep-learning like a eyes is big umbrella good back to the do not pay stuff Joshua browder's app for contesting parking tickets I thought it was pretty cool that the most Innovative bought that we've seen was made by a t
 major I think it really goes to show that the youth continue to make the most Innovative breakthroughs on new products was more I didn't actually focus on the age it was more about the same theme where somebody has a problem a personal problem and they build a solution for themselves which is what happened with Joshua he mentioned he was getting this tickets you no parking tickets or whatever and then at one point his parents were like you know what we're not going to pay for this tickets like you have to like learn or like it was getting out of hand it's what it sounded like so he was like well what can I do like how can I solve this problem that I personally have so that's when he was like you know maybe I could how do you say contest the ticket yeah so it's so that's what happened
 like he had his problem and then he build a solution for himself and then found that other people could benefit from it which is what I hear a lot of and for example startup school which is another podcast and Sears of lectures where they are like if you want to build something we see that the best Solutions come from people that actually experience the problem so I think Uber is a similar story they were at a bar or something and they they were like oh it would just be cool or Lyft I'm not really sure which one of those but it's the same Roots you have a problem and you want to solve it for yourself yeah she's speaking of that we're both Engineers were podcasters you host the women in Tech show I know as engineer many times have the same recurrent issues and you know the chatops movement is Biz designed to help make those recurring issues
 responded to buy a chatbot do you ever think about it like as a podcaster like how could a chatbot be helpful like I mean we do do the same things over and over again we were record audio in one place we uploaded to another place you send it to an audio editor through an email there's all these interfaces that have to deal with through the podcasting process would it be cool if there were a chatbot that could unify all these things it could just be like the podcasting workflow chatbot I don't know about a Chad but I definitely see your system for for example you have to whenever I plug in the mic I have to go to settings and make sure it selects the USB mic sometimes it doesn't and then when I'm going to start recording sometimes it's it selects the default laptop mic so I have to manually select the mic so those things could definitely be automated but I'm not super sure about using a chat interface for for this
 particular pauses more like you mentioned in making a customer service and better like you mentioned your case with Uber right okay so just a wrap up tomorrow or on Tuesday actually in a couple days I'm talking to Eugenia cuida who created this chat bot after her friend passed away I just called and Memorial bought so basically yeah so it was like after her friend passed away she collected all these text messages that were written and made it deep Learning System that processed all those messages and they created bought out of it and you can chat with the Bots and it's kind of like talking to a ghost and right now it's kind of controversial perhaps it doesn't work very well but if you think this is a sign of things to come I guess this is on the same Spectrum as shall ice with the bought that sort of like her
 I mean how far do you think we are from using Bots to create likenesses of people that can keep us company of expressing emotion of a process you know the reason why I was I saw an article where several years ago a lot of years ago whenever somebody would die the whole family would take a family portrait with the dead body and it was a long exposure photographs so you know it's a different way of getting past a difficult time but I can definitely see using other people other people's messages to come up with Bob personalities for the one that I can think of is the you did a show on Zuckerberg files like they have all this response from Mark Zuckerberg lay there could even be a bot that just
 looks like Mark Zuckerberg so we can definitely take real individuals messaging I don't know to like learn how to build a personality but I'm not sure I mean they're obviously privacy implications or it would have to be people that agree to that up didn't you know just share okay well that sounds like a good place to stop it was great seeing you had bought day and discussing the future of conversational interfaces and thanks again to O'Reilly we both got tickets through our podcast me through software engineering daily you through the women in Tech show so yeah Riley has been a great partner in helping us learn and kind of get a window into the future thank you for having me on the show it was great talking to you also

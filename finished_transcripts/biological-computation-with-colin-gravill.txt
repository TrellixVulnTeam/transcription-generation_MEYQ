Transcription: biology research at Microsoft is focused on three main areas molecular programming synthetic biology and stem cell biology at the intersection of biology in Computing and there are implications for health medicine and efficient Computing techniques the field of biological computation is in its early days and there's still lots of work to be done call and gravel works in the computational science group at Microsoft research and on today's episode explains how Microsoft is investigating biology with the same curiosity and pragmatism that Microsoft investigates computer science I'd love to do more shows at the border of software and biology and if you have suggestions please send me an email Jeff at software engineering daily.com I have a persisting interest in both biology and software so I'd love to hear your thoughts on that I hope you enjoyed today's episode
continuous integration gives you faster safer software delivery with A continuous integration tool like Snap CI from thoughtworks the members of your team can push changes independently of each other and they can all see their new build running against different phases of tests before those changes make their way into production the fastest moving companies that I've talked to on software engineering daily are all using continuous integration snap CI from fireworks is available to anyone and if you go to snap. Co / software engineering daily you can check it out for yourself and support software engineering daily with just a few clicks I had my own continuous-integration is set up for some projects that were just sitting in my GitHub account without continuous-integration I got continued education up quite easily using snap CI if you want to be that Hero at your company that starts moving your organization towards deploying often
confidently towards that devops dream start working with SNAP CI at snap. Co / software engineering daily your co-workers will see you working with SNAP CI and they will fall in love with it themselves oven time to take somebody at a bigger company to go out on their own and say okay I'm going to roll out see I even though nobody else of the companies using it and maybe that Hero at the company is going to be you so check out snap. CA / software engineering daily and thanks to thought works for being a continuous sponsor software engineer daily it really means a lot call and gravel works in the computational science group at Microsoft research software engineering daily your research group at Microsoft is focused
three main areas molecular programming synthetic biology and stem cell biology and I'd like to get into each of these areas but we should start more abstractly because there are so many ant unanswered questions in biology and I want to get a feeling for how you approach biological questions from the standpoint of pure science of programming is there a certain class of questions that are well-suited today to being solved with computation because biology it's so complex there's so many moving pieces and so many unknown things today what are the kinds of questions that we can answer today with computation yet so we will figure some of these few different kind of example areas of the stupid questions to drive us want is to understand what biology is doing now and then the other side of it is how was my
we Delta flight booked a biological systems so part of its inspiration natural scientific curiosity and Engineering so let's build systems of the useful to society I do that using the power the Peyote has in the scale and efficiency how is Frontier of the questions that we can begin to answer and the things that we can study in biology how is that expanded in recent years so what are the big changes in this is the kind of do you find the Peyote side is at single-cell Teresa what's a tradition you might have been done is studying populations of sells Obagi Eagle systems but we may have to do with advances in instrumentation and computational methods is identified with single Soule Easter egg on multiple individual cells and see how that has an Amex of that sell cause bone two populations to squat challenge
the sun was single cells during the girls are having it Go sheets and works with other cells to achieve a goal what are those technological advances that have allowed us to zoom in on a single cell at some of them microscopy methods so also Imaging methods so we can track much better what's going on so I can see the vision systems the top of things that are out of my colleagues in groups like to buy condoms at The Kinetic Sand Hollow Ln and some of those types of methods on to tracking what cells are doing understanding what behaviors they have and then feeding those aren't the kind of computational models we Bell try to understand what and how we might go through similar things do you think of the human body is a kind of computer I think about it it's an information-processing system that has inputs and try to achieve certain things
the original that is very philosophical question I but we find a useful way to think about what's going on and it's led to insights as to its very nature account open question are there ways that you can think of that break down that analogy you like are there I'm sure you thought about this question I mean how is a biological entity significantly different than the computer systems that we deal with today I'm an inch and will you have these individual prices in units on even with my device of multicolored systems you don't tend to have so many of an individual prices especially not the scale of biology that you have these autonomous units where is in Computing systems you pick up the inputs and I collaborate and that maybe answer the question you have about white people using a website more or less biology the end
call Sal's I might be coming out of program do they do in concert so it's a little more like like Maxim models or a large-scale Distribution Systems for on a scale much bigger than software Engineers getting off on a date site basis even those software Engineers who are operating a data center in your cluster or something you think it's still a scale that is not not close to what biological system is processing sewing machine body contains trillions of individual cells each of the cells is very complicated so she's kind of comparison between like I like for the newest Intel chips does billions of transistors with several orders scales bigger than that just on a single cell at it just buy something to the cells in the body have an issue jam out to complexity of how they interact on off does significance
Skyrim between about what's going on so it's it's just a little interesting we can use some of the similar software methods that colleagues use on distributed systems on electrical systems such as consensus which we will get into is that right is publishing scientific breakthroughs we also want to feed that into these engineering ideas one of them is this idea of the box of majority calculation so control fairy has two different agents they need to come to a consensus River Swanky's true or false and they might have to do that in real time I need to take an example in biology if some population of cells and some of them seemed in a bad state so they might indicate cancer you might want to indicate is the 04 population a large Jima was a small infection that you worked your choices has behave would be different in those cases okay so we'll talk about
more of that a little bit later but why we're still talking a high-level why is the area of medicine and biology in this kind of research why is it useful to Microsoft so we shouldn't pick up Trinity to just kind of Explorer where we can get to next the the industry that might exist lights are just phenomenal the sometimes is that the whole computer industry is built on programming silicone-based devices we see situations in Industry way if you can have intelligent control over chemical fabrication and you can officially design bacteria that can create those products that's that's an industry that even bigger than programming silicon chips for the question is how's it possible how can you do it efficiently and effectively and it sounds like the barriers keeping us from applying some of these computational Concepts II
biology at this point those barriers are more rooted in science than they are in policy would like we're not at the point where it's kind of like with drones wear with drones like the Technologies really getting there and we can we could imagine reasonably imagine production systems with drones flying around if not for the policy but with Biology and we're not really there yet it's not like we have policy that significantly impinging on our ability to progress is that right obviously has kind of questions implications. Treatments that I Happening Now based on stem cell therapies the challenges we don't really understand why they work and what the times when they don't work on smart watches helping contribute fundamental understanding to that so what we hope is helping make it more feasible to get better treatment so that's probably one area where this kind of policy
all in some senses which artery engineer human bodies are doing a very indirect fashion at some of the most fundamental long-term search around a computer with molecules that's a lot more speculative where some technology questions about the first
 okay so what is at the intersection of machine learning and biology I mean search Potter is the sisters of gnomus Corpus of data we can acquire but then feeding it through all models answer efficiently choosing the models to do that to me one of the key techniques for use as I signed it called and CNC multicolor chain and you can think of this as taking taking a spot in that the space of possible behaviors in biology I'm running a computer simulation from that and seeing where that soon as you do this millions and millions of times you can optimize your model to be more like reality machine learning techniques for adaptively understanding when it's also very useful to have somebody machine on the experts to help us so this area
 like I've done a number of shows recently where we touch on deep learning and it seems like deep learning is really useful in these areas where you have a complex classification problem where it's hard to define the features that would create her compose a classifier but we have so many examples that fall into that classification that we can use deep learning to learn features it's the Deep Learning System can learn those features that sell for example if you have a billion pictures of tumors maybe you don't want to create a manual setup classifier manual set of features that will classify a tumor but you can just feed in all those images into a deep Learning System are you seeing any interesting examples of deep learning I primarily in my group we tend to work on what we turn mechanistic models so understanding how proteins and cells interact how many times to count
 models on that but I kind of see a lot of opportunities and places for deep learning techniques to be used all Imaging of input data so she was behaving how well perhaps the following the programs we might have tried building and I'm putting in a Petri dish that the Deep learning techniques make it a lot cheaper and easier to I extract the signal from the system I hope it's kind of the edge of the inputs process these papers that have been recently released of doing gpu-based image analysis of a bacterial colonies and so historically lot of this stuff is done it in a very painful white so this is one of the challenges with science that if you can get it done with a PhD student who manually labels day so I should get quite follow along with that person sometimes
 but what kind of crossing the scales now that we need a better constrained model and a lot more accurate and so it's not feasible to deploy the number of people you need to annotate ASA and by using some of the deep learning techniques machine learning methods this is an area where was that a signal for

 okay I want. Is that your team has looked into specifically first one is molecular programming what is molecular programming. So this is the kind of building up flashing so we sometimes nanotechnology robots instead what we're doing is taking a double-stranded DNA Helix and cussing it in the right places I said this is a series of chemical bonds on the on the nanoscale places that we can only use for little units I'm one of the things we can do to take me to sign it so we can cut them so that we can just take photos I'm gate so that if we had a little fragment represented the an section you need both of the other chemicals to be present in the solution
 full to be traded I'm sorry but we might be out to do is find on the output of this process to fluoresce so this means we could try this up on a petri dish and then image it is equivalent to the foundation of electronics so there is also this term molecular Computing can you differentiate molecular programming for molecular Computing distinction the sense of the complications of specific language is the molecular mass of you designing simulating Allen the computation that comes out I mean These Times obit interchangeable used as well oh okay okay so do molecules do they add deterministic Lee enough to build computers out of them or do you have to build higher level abstractions out of these molecules to factor out the non determinant like with Tran
 we have you know we have a notion that it's 0 or 1 it's on or talk but in reality there is a range of of charges or Camarillo voltage or something where you know it's kind it's at the lowest level it's non-deterministic you know it's not highly granular if the the transistor is on or off the weed Define a range of states that indicate that it's on and arranger states that indicate that it's office at the same thing with molecules where you have a sense of non determinism at the lowest level in you build abstractions at a higher level that factor out that not determinism. So this is actually really interesting ongoing devices exactly as you say in electronics we have this illusion that things are binary consistent and it's been interesting to like I'm going to work until whenever people I'll try to get these voltage it down two things more efficient have the phone was out at you you might get high all right so I need to balance that I was an idea that we
 just simplifying and biology the old are the individual Gates and reactions of noisy because all sorts of things are happening other things get into solution and break the gates the mighty manufacturing we might be able to build a level of Jetson and digital Logic on top by the system being noisy now the challenge with that says that it's usually quite a lot of structure especially when you were sent to do this type of thing in cells rather than in molecules you putting an energy Budget on the system again and in the case of cells that can be quite bad because it sounds like to evolve out at bud and say this is alternative approaches a bit like confusing I building a live check with Gates and said we can embed the album's most directly about the approximate Rossi complication so it's this it's really out of it
 Rachel Gates as such we got this distribution consensus system directly in fermented and some of the tools right this is what happens when we build Progressive Lehigh abstractions and then just like on the computer you but you can call down to assembly we can pile down to DNA testing at the purpose of the purposes of the consensus protocol that you built at the molecular level was to do this kind of builds kind of determinism out of a non-deterministic system exactly the Evolve of them trying to suppress noise on but it might be possible to build some of these are goes directly take advantage of biological type systems that really interesting as old as redundancy because it's somebody that's the most efficient like it might be it just happened to evolve
 into that position I don't know what happened to be successful but there is a kind of General Trend towards things that exist in biology are there because I more efficient than welcome title 10 ounces so you have this system of molecular Computing which is where you use molecules to create what are effectively programmable computers at the molecular level and then you and then you have molecular programming which can be used to simulate molecular systems with code so this would be in the computer you could simulate how how molecules might work so perhaps you can run simulations a lot more aggressively on a computer than you would be able to with a with a wet lab how do you use these two systems together and what does the workflow pipeline look like when you're trying to run some large experiment tour
 some kind of system with these two kinds of systems in conjunction and one of our design tools and it looks like some very up to send text even worse than like a calendar like What it lets you do is been run a simulation of what you expect this is about built on energy models and understanding as detailed as like Mystic and molecular expensive but you know of a supercomputer county line for a few milliseconds I was a lot of computer so we call this lady high levels of distractions the overtime was demonstrated by a caption reality happens we got this prediction this would be a useful piece of functionality and so we take the output of a tool that Saturday night we might send it to a company on the internet over the over the web by the
 they will in Jumbotron fabricate at first but depending on the sequences they might have to talk to us about it. Then post the primers for the Postal Service telling wife in the lab will then take it and then build up more copies of those haven't I have to expend Cleveland experiments the software experiment I don't see how well it can pass consensus algorithm or system have a nice picture what it is we see consensus in computer science when you have a big distributed system and you need for example distributed database you need each of those database replicas to have an identical sense of the world otherwise when people make requests to this database to this distributed database they might get different answers so you need these different databases to have consensus and
 the algorithms that allow those databases to have consensus or quite complicated there's some of the hardest things I've dealt with in computer science how how do you build that into molecular Machinery what was the process and tell me what was the motivation for that project so none of this is again this Friday or fundamentals but if you can demonstrate you can do these key building blocks you able to actually build anything else I mean like 7 / languages that we can fabricate to Troy and complete so it's fair you can because any computers out of that efficiency as what's the most comfortable language to work and what's the most effective want to build in the case of the consensus album published
 all this means is that the probability of error and so these connects to be useful in Computing system so you have all these ideas about things like the eventual consistency and she might have somebody connects to your website and it might be sufficient for you to get out of truck somebody correct answer so the times when this might be important if you need to sleep better performance or you need a bed of availability but you need to answer the question as they see floaters in then being out to 4chan Pol have what's more of one or more of less as an administrator of an incorrect answer that might be totally dependent in your system design what are the other things that Microsoft is doing around this molecular programming and molecular Computing at this point interesting project I would like to group of Oz in the US are they working on Robert and molecular computer ink that working on molecular storage so using DNA as a long time
 mechanism for storing die so I can imagine that there associated with is your team as well and the lungs the long time ago for this is just the enormous potential if you if you look at the na and you imagine we have to pack enough of it in its information density is far above any kind of commercial storage that we have so buy some measures you can fit 6 bytes of data into cubic millimeters question about how you get it all together and how you untangle it but these are questions for that they're looking into understanding that would be so much better than it's got potential ability to carry around all your day too in some ways but you have to get it off as well it's not something that speak actually looked into that team has the current public record of biggest amount of information stored at 7 its 200 megabytes which is it sounds very small but these processes go up rapidly when you can figure out
 tools to do and they sure do to ease your change the ways that we will be using biology as computation do you think they'll be similar to how our bodies use biology for computation or are the processes that we have evolved so complex and so difficult to actually untangle that we can actually get to the root of how are but when I think about it it's like you know we have these deep Learning Systems they were building these days like a mad recognition systems and the researchers who are building these image recognition systems they will admit up front we don't know how this is War I mean it's at some level we understand how it's working but you know we openly admit these deep Learning Systems they evolve in such a way that we don't really understand the features that they're looking for they've got so many layers blah blah blah blah blah and that's how that's how humans evolved that's how our bodies worked and so
 it seems like almost intractable to decode how humans function from a biological standpoint now what we can do is look at the Primitive of the human body and and just observe that there are really efficient data storage techniques and systems processing techniques that we can say okay let's look at that it looks like of the human body is proof that we can build these kinds of things but decoding how how the human body has actually evolve the systems maybe intractable I mean you can see what I'm saying like there's seems like these these two separate paths we can look at biology is it as a template in a wide open space where you can drive your own systems and then you can look at it as as something where you're really trying to replicate the way that things have evolved over time in the ladder to me seems Seems far less tractable
 some of what we're trying to do as a group so these two different takes on biology what is the kind of bioinformatics root where you going to Jeff's Behavior the phenotype of an organism and you have the genetic code I need to try and draw correlation and causation between us we're actually it's like you were saying he's going to some of the fundamental Primitives so where would try to attack at Pablo's how does individual bits and pieces of a biological system works like for example of how an immune system cell assesses weather another cell has been infected or whatever it's healthy and the lot of Imaging techniques that you can look at the fragments of proteins that are coming out I try to build models of how the the immune system works my mathematical perspective I wish I had some really good progress in understanding estimates of that and then using that to build predictive models of how the body will behave so we all sing
 are functional basis fragments of how ecosystems work success in building software models that a mechanistic either not just any models which I do you say a lot of the transmissions in the field will say it's protective but we don't understand the inside reasoning wait we try possible to what kind of Isis also understand the mechanism and they have two drawer connection so we can explain to a biologist and think they would recognize long-term more supportable sure absolutely I mean yeah like I think about the the medical industry and you know I know I never people who are on these pharmaceutical drugs and I were there you know either it's chronic chronic Lee there on the drug like a ditch their plan to be on if the rest of their life or it's some kind of short-term thing and I always found the
 a lot of pharmaceutical drugs to be making to be so suspect because they tend to be claims that are just like okay yeah we apply this drug and then we get this kind of outcome and then they should have sidestepped the question of okay this is a causal connection or we have a very good understanding of of the causal connection when in fact it's more of like a correlative thing like we've grown enough stuff at the wall and now this kind of works better than other things like and there's a disconnect between the consumer and the creator of that pharmaceutical practice in this is getting a little off topic but I just bring it up to to say that I I agree with your your perspective that will be more sustainable to understand what is actually going on rather than having this kind of random walking and eventually stumbling upon some sort of success
 as well because fragmatic will use but works example that is that we rebuilt circuits that's a Philip peppers and we generated over circuits the more complex versions of that like riding in various different features that cause pain to biological systems and they become a question like why is the bald biology like that may be really interesting type of the week used these kind of numerical methods to simulate a noisy system so the things you find in a in a body like a lot of chemicals going on and changing how the system is being signaled and simulator in software we show you the more complex versions are better than better handling noise so a simple circuit Works going to an Apache Dash on its own but by adding any specific areas of complexity we can show that noisy systems. It's a bit of a stretch to say that we understand the mechanisms of exactly why that's happening in the biology or why that was chosen but it is interesting
 complexity candy progressively justify the x 10 area that we haven't discussed yet that Microsoft is concerned with is synthetic biology what is synthetic biology the large different definitions list for the origin the idea it would be easier to build up some fundamental parts counter equivalent to a larger scale so but other people to use the time synthetic biology genetic engineering biology the idea that you might be able to also sells to put you stuff that you want so this is kind of used for industrial processes so if you want to do certain drugs like mention the pharmaceutical companies most of the companies and now switching over to using biological woods they tend to use chemical was before but why don't you go boots are in a sentence chemistry with a bit more intelligent than adaptability that they can more efficiently it high yields if you can design the biology could use what you need what do you mean can you talk more
 how those pharmaceutical research techniques have changed over time yet so and pharmaceuticals at trying to put use a sudden compound that you showed has I like on talking too fat for some kind of disease or issue a person has the chemical you want to put juice and the might be routes to precept but for chemistry but they might be incredibly like your yelled and that's so expensive unite might need a vast amounts of chemicals to use fractions of a percentage of the the targets molecule you want to kind of interesting that biology has all these tricks that catalyze reactions to the infeasible of a wise and so you might know them or do you want but you can't easily produce it but some other form of a particle actually like cells might happen to do a part of that pathway and so it gives you an extra bit of a toolbox can you talk about the project
 Microsoft around synthetic biology. So one of the things we doing at the moment I got it comes back to fundamentals is this really interesting paper in the 50s where he talks about the chemical basis of morphogenesis the important part about this is the one of the things he observed is a lot of high-level macroscale biological systems like stripes or spots on animals can actually be explained by really simple chemical interactions so you can imagine we have to do this if you said lights and the the dog chemicals to this part and she had a master plan but what he was observing is the systems can actually self-organizing Patrice this really interesting complexity at all questions about symmetry breaking about how this actually goes on in practice but we're trying to do is take that mathematical model and fill it into cells so that we can fold patterns in bacteria I want to talk about stem cells some what is
 a stem cell and how does stem cell biology play into Microsoft research a stem cell is a cell become many of a type of cell animal cell phone you so the origin of your your body is made up by a series of stem cells have differentiated as long as a tree of different cells are the parts of your body wet it's complex that you might still have a sudden quantities of stem cells the hope of this is it's it's kind of the basis of his idea if we genitive medicine if you can convince some of your cells to go back up to differentiation become other cells they could fix all sorts of problems so the possibilities of this is huge piece of used for people who are blind and deaf people have had a stem cells harvested from them or differentiated cells they can treated with chemicals turn back into the stem cells that have to be injected I'm leaving out to see I mean
 it is the kind of this is what sign should be in Sam's medicine the problems we say is that we don't know why that works at times
 what's the typical model of job search and makes it easy to apply to multiple jobs and get multiple offers and deprime simplifies your job search and helps you land that ideal software engineering position candidates get immediate exposure to the best tech companies with just one simple application to indeed Prime companies on indeed Prime exclusive platform will message candidates with salary and Equity up front so if you're an engineer you just get message by at these companies and the average software developer gets 5 employer contact and an average salary offer of $125,000 so if you're an average software developer on this platform you will get 5 contacts and that average salary of offer of $125,000
 80 Prime is 100% free for candidates there are no strings attached and you get a signing bonus when you're hired you get $2,000 to say thanks for using a deep Prime what if you are a software engineering daily listener you can sign up with indeed.com SE daily to go to that URL and you will get $5,000 instead if you go to indeed.com daily it would support software engineering daily and you would be able to be eligible for that $5,000 bonus instead of the normal $2,000 bonus on indeed Prime thanks to indeed Prime for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily and for representing a new way to get hired as an engineer and have a little more leverage a little more optionality and a little more ease of use
 you should we don't know why it works but we were compelled to try it what is what's at the root of that scientific method I mean it cuz that's I think that's kind of get to the heart of what we're talking about also like here is something that we took don't totally understand but we were compelled to try it how are we compelled in that direction I just cuz there's so much motivation of understanding sweet like developmental biology so understanding how you go from a fetus to app for baby and you're bored and that's your buddy progresses every time I mean that type of thing is studied in simply mammals at all so simple organisms as well I'm one of the key elements that is how does a cell decide to differentiate into one cell how does it decide this is the white location and this is for to be like series of chemical signals and internal states of tracking What's happen to the cell in the past
 and we want to know where that price I say it's and you can do that potentially by breaking the cells in particular ways and seeing if it still feels at 12 or adding additional chemicals at different time periods are there specific research experiments around stem cells that you're doing at Microsoft are the plant Sciences group in Cambridge University of Washington and the US on the stem cell work we all the work is done externally from all apps at the stem cell Institute University of Cambridge do amazing work and we can I play with them unless so we're turning to do is the model and helping advised experimentalist which experiments are the most likely to have interesting results so one of these families that we published paper and science about is taking experimental data about which chemical signals when needed to make the jeans
 switch on the light sequence for the stem cells to self when you that population that's the way we do this is by taking models of the genetic Network and experimental observations and running it through what time does constraints over or I sent to you so so this is a piece of research that Microsoft uses for analyzing like device drivers in the life that we turned it at applied at the biology can you talk more about how to shave the inside to to apply that type of tool to something so closely related to buy a biology extremely brilliant about how you see private institutions like Microsoft interacting with the research universities cuz it sounds like the relationship that Microsoft has with these
 University second Cambridge or University of Washington it sounds like it really is a relationship that caters to the strengths of both parties. Yeah absolutely historically we focus entirely on the model and Tiny been in the last couple years though we've also started doing some of the experimental validation as well and we still maintain all links big of a lobster on a lot of the largest Alabama to work we just want to send the feedback loop on some of our intitle designs as well but you should definitely think of Microsoft research in general but as especially as being I can academic organization we see the longtime industrial potential I have a lot of ideas but it is kind of amazing that Microsoft has this long time fashion of ideas and giving them time to come to fruition absolutely and given that long-term thinking and
 the academic sensibility that you seem to have from the research Microsoft research standpoint what's your Sims 4 how the the how things progress in Microsoft research versus in universities cuz I I mean and universities and perhaps government institutions there are places where there's red tape or funding issues are the lack of those things desirable qualities that you can seek out given that they're not they're not as existent in an in an industrial setting I would send the amazing to have the results is when we can demonstrate the value of it so the people who had ideas and title either they can commercialize them to make him get enormous amounts of resources and time later then back them up but it's great to be able to carry out the most
 ideas that are going to be huge game changes and it in the future so the world comes inside the Kinect many years in the making and major pieces deployed commercial technology fruitful Partnerships with other industrial organizations like pharmaceutical companies what I'm going to be like this we were at, these fundamental improvements and so they had a lot of fun to do companies come to talk shows about these ideas and how they might apply them to design a biological sister I'm it'll be interesting to see what happens in the future height whatever kind of active phone if you take space to leave message Saul awesome drink that shows enough benefit that could be deployed commercial as well there are certain things that we do today in medicine that I think eventually will look like they are really like out of the Stone Age I figure
 looks like the modern equivalent of bloodletting and specifically I'm thinking of the lack of personalized medicine like the way that we treat people with her some medicine and it's not personalized I think of this is an example where is really unfortunate that we can kind of see the the road then turns a personalized medicine how useful it's going to be but we were not just not there yet because we don't have the right tool and we don't have the right I guess experimental techniques or maybe you can talk more about that like what is the road to personalized medicine really interesting version of that I saw and this is very speculative it's not work done directly by all app but people took samples of the person they apply to what chemicals to add juice as stem cell like behavior and they were able to grow what's terms and Olivia organoid that's the idea that says it's not a full organ it say
 a set of cells or tissue that has some of the same characteristics I'm one of the ideas comes exactly what you're saying too kind of personalized medicine if you could grow this on a personal basis you could then give the chemicals you're proposing to give to that person to this organelle inside first and then see if there's any which action or see what effects it has on so the potential flight long-term drug safety and experimental technique is an Armistice vauban having to treat on animal models instead treat more directly on something the crossbones to human we see the same things of press releases of cancer treatments in my life treating cancer in mice but a lot of guys don't necessarily translate because of the enormous complexity and even very belts between mice and human immune systems not to mention the ethical concerns that we can put to the side with animal testing and testing on an ore
 yeah there's no nervous system that it's connected to show as far as we understand pain and how animals process pain is not really any of that associated with testing on an orgonite exactly I could be amazing if we could move all the all the testing in the software but we probably need some biological models and so amazing it's medius type of girl models of biological systems that we won with sufficient accuracy that's drugs and experiments could be tested on those as a intermediate staff drug Discovery I think you mentioned that the strategies for drug Discovery are going from a chemical purely chemical chemistry bases to more of a biological basis how how do you say drug Discovery changing the near future. So just on the initial that shows the time by since it's the fabrication of those drugs so drugs that we've established of all the efficient some of them are actually quite hard to grow as a great case of this
 synthetic biology whack one of the precursors to Auntie malaria truck can only be extracted from a sudden plants as South missile acid and a company go to amaris I had an enormous many yet project costing many millions of dollars in order to design a biological pathway that produced this compound this is too expensive like most companies Ambiance before that it's not cost effective to do that and so just want to pharmaceutical drug manufacturing perspective then it's a lot of benefits of these synthetic biology fabrication techniques have some longer time does these questions about could we designed better drugs but that's a is a lot more speculative questions around that crispr I hear a lot about this technology what is crispr useful for are you doing any research around crispr Gene editing technique so
 is cheaper to edit she knows what he wants out of them so the origin of this is it's a kind of bacterial immune system that uses to defend itself against viruses bacteria themselves get infections as well that's so this is I said quite recent discovery and it's become a huge fan of the engineering of logical systems in the last yes but you can also just said is a cost-reduction the the word techniques for fabricating the GM she wanted but they were the Boris and Chris Brown is a lot more talkative this allows us to write the changes to Bicycle systems we want to and i n h e fashion affect the current way that we do biological testing and
 in a wet labs and stuff it reminds me of like when you see those numbers like projecting myself into the future it reminds me of those pictures that you see if people working this huge rooms with IBM computers or with vacuum tubes and stuff and it seems like we are going to eventually get to a point where we have these automated Labs where it's like an Amazon web services or a Microsoft Microsoft Azure for running biological experiments and where you get to the point where you can have some kid who's in high school who can spin up an experiment from his desktop computer do you think that's is that a fanciful Notions or do you think that is something that will be a reality place to do a version of this so right as in Emerald something transcriptic as a related application
 synthetic biology Foundry I had to pay for college in London so I the UK's investing substantially in synthetic biology in general and whip Microsoft research is part of a Consortium and one of those aspects is at The Foundry way you can send instructions for an experiment how does extractions will be carried out and then get the results back. In some ways even better than what we had to do the moment which is we send off the specification for inputs and then we do a lot of experimental sells it is really early days are some of the companies involved in this at what actually happens is you a list of instructions and then somebody in a lab wanders around and carries out those which Mechanical Turk I kind of think of a little bit like Mechanical Turk version of biology I mean
 that's often times the place where are where complex automation starts because once you have what you have the Mechanical Turk side of things then you've at least you've at least bounded the start and end of the process that is necessary to automate and then the person who is in the middle proceed with that automation can better understand okay what are the steps that make up this wet lab experiment that the person is commissioned me to do and then one by one those individual steps can be automated in for you know what you got you got a robot sister doing it we have a number for trying to connect for my programming languages that's just the software simulation but we want to be able to design experiments that have the highest information content and ideally we'd like a lot of these things we carried out automatically experimental
 sister are significantly more flexible environment machine how to specify what he wanted to be and then you have a standardized container you can just play a thousand what are the other tools that Microsoft research is developing using stuff that we have not discussed yet can you can you talk about some of the tooling that your team is working on tools available so we talked about the software tools and we had to make it tonight just good science the when we published we also try and make tools available if people can go on over the web for the thing is most of these tools for the route to be small-scale and so one of the big questions we have is how do we make it possible for people to use a whole clusters the same way we do and finally found them
 methods of analysis and improved time machine learning algorithms I would like to make these things available because its in-house get back their answers and then getting with a science okay I want to close off with a somewhat naive question but maybe you will have some interesting responses I find that naive question sometimes spur complex and interesting responses but do you think we will solve cancer because cancer cancer to me seems like an example of this thing was really hard to tell are all are all do all cancers do all malignant cancers have some kind of quality that we can Define and then deployed drug to snipe all of those types of cancers or is it this thing that is so deeply wedded to our biology that we can't identify the generality of cancer and we are reduced to
 this problem of developing for specialized treatment for all specific kinds of cancers most of the biologist in like half of a P10 decide that it's nobody's thanking me in the right way to kill cancer because cancer is incense you'll sells having errors I'm going off on road it's not you shouldn't think of exactly is this infection does coming to your body that you want to kill these miniature one now that says one way to kill the cancer to keep and selectively kill themselves they have these bugs because I was going on you can manage the whole process that's one of the things that we've worked around is like chemical sensing that's what you can do things like I actually text Silas counselors and if you take another technique which we have mentioned we should sound like DNA origami weaving Allstate Billings give a sheets of DNA and putting for ap6 inside the you can actually more
 collectively deliver those type uses this can work and and experimental app conditions book is this is not some of this done or I told you but I did it would be if you can select delete all get weapons off and you can recognize it actually I'm sure Uprising in the Black Hills scale you can go actually tried to it like you were saying it since the chemotherapy drug is Celexa poison in your body Advocate cancer cells tend to grow more rapidly than they consume more poison and nobody would think that's a good idea but actually it's kind of effective over okay Colin well thanks for coming to show it's been an inspiring conversation with you and excited to hear about where Microsoft is going in terms of research into biology
 if your organization is working on a microservices architecture check out the micro services.com practitioner Summit in San Francisco on January 31st sponsored by datawire.

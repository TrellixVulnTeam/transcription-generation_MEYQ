Transcription: Bruce schneier is a security researcher and author of several books most recently data and Goliath the hidden files to capture your data and control your world Bruce welcome to software engineering daily talking about your newest book data and Goliath transaction stored saved who is Goliath
the Goliath is the date of collectors it's governments and corporations it's everybody who
 sits between us and the internet us and our data it's our phone companies it's companies like Google it's the NSA or whatever country you happen to live in its everybody who wants our data
 what is the motives of these different Glides
 other two basic motives of what the motive is to get power and data is power power for different purposes if you're a corporation you want data because it is marketing power this advertising power does persuasive power its power to convince others to buy your stuff to behave in the way you want night if you are a government it's more coercive power now you the power to go after criminals go after political dissidents go after Those whom you don't want it to operate freely in society make the Ping I just depending on what country you are and it's good or bad and then miss up around the edges by politics during a lot of data collection there and there is also a persuasive power its marketing but where were selling is candidates and not soft drinks but it's the same basic idea
 Facebook recently received a patent to help lenders discriminate against borrowers based on social connections and other social data the consequences of this type of system that's not new your wee-wee to hearing about lenders looking at your social connection to see if you're worthy of a loan even before this Facebook patent and in a sense it could be a good thing people in countries without any credit need some way to establish that they are responsible members of society one of the ways you can do that is by show when your social network so there shortly positives here but in general this notion that you are judged by your data
 can I have some very dangerous consequences because it's easy for the day to get it wrong that being judged by your data can be arbitrary can be confusing this little ways to correct the record so there are positives and negatives here
 speaking of the Judgment in the face of data I'd like to talk some about the Ashley Madison Case where a hacker or group of hackers recently released all of the user data for Ashley Madison just Square married individuals can find each other and commit adultery and the story is getting increasingly perverse yesterday I read that most of the female users are actually robots do you have any thoughts on the store in the implications of it it is a big deal it's it's and it's not know the seriousness of it to me the new story because it's an adultery site because the people on they are doing something that is socially
 considered bad that they are they're misbehaving but what this is really is
 a bunch of people should have been caught in the blast radius of a bigger hack hackers went after Ashley Madison for seems like personal reasons against the company and they in the process did a lot of damage to individuals who entrusted their privacy to this site so this is not the first time I've seen this the last year the government of North Korea attacks Sony because of a movie and they as part of the attack published lots and lots of corporate emails and the Press wrote about the CEO emails where he was making racist jokes about President Obama and complaining about his movie stars a lot of stuff for fodder for the Press but is there exo-suits of regular employees doing regular thing as having regular conversations with colleagues and friends and loved ones and their privacy was violated it's the same thing they were
 current the target they were an inverting victim all of these Ashley Madison users were inadvertent victims of this hack and I think this is going to be a increasingly common attack that this when I call organizational doxing someone breaks into a corporate Network steals all the data and publishes it is going to become more and more common then one of us users employees regular people will be hurt because of it you could imagine a scenario where this could have been some sort of like an anonymous type of group that I believe this was such a terrible situation in males contact Century talking to bots that are passing the Turing test convincing them that their women under that type of circumstance
 what type of ethical pack really depends if it's not it's really not ethical to publish the personal day of hundreds of thousands millions of people and whether it is a hacker doing it from the outside right that was hacking team who did that a hacker publish all the data from the side where the Dodge manufacturer hacking team or a few years ago women the HP Gary Federal weather to nation-state doing it which it seems to happen with Sony weather it is in an Insider doing it right now Wikileaks is publishing Norms number of cables from the Saudia Arabian government is similar to Chelsea Manning in the state department that might been inside of might have been The Outsider these attacks are different people but insiders Outsiders government individuals are for different purposes some of them are are more moral than others and I think the hacking team will it was certainly an active of
 reality a Sony much less so Ashley Madison mean it's one thing to expose the company's duplicity in a variety of instances it's another to publish the identities of millions of the people who really know did nothing wrong and don't deserve this so I really disagree the tactic here we look back at this and that and think about it as a watershed event in security if we do think about it that way it seems the motif of your thinking about is that it this idea of a blast radius where these people that were not necessarily the intentional victims of the hacking become victims and this is increasingly going to be a problem right now we're living in a on an internet where our data is elsewhere and this is relatively new five ten years ago my email is on my computer there are documents were on our computer now
 we use eat on internet email providers are calendar address for Boulder sucks photos of our stuff is elsewhere so we're forced to rely on these companies were security remember the Apple a cup of the photo archive from last year that only happened because everyone store their photos in the cloud if the photos are on our computers that wouldn't have happened in the same way so we are all entrusting are security to these companies that we don't truly understand that might not have our best interest at heart
 what about these bots in humans are food by box that are masquerading as romantic Partners is this is security breach has our romance been security breach to Adam I don't know I mean it to me this is part of the recipients of the story there lots of box out there their they're used offer help people shop and the people can be fooled by romantic box at someone else's story I don't think it's a security story that I think is really strict Asian part of the story blaxican wheel part is the data and and it could have easily been been data that's just as personal but not as lascivious and data about which which disease is you're searching date about your mental health aide about your physical health
 the data about your loves this could be a regular dating site what is the difference between security and privacy
 odd question up there different words their they're related Concepts I'll go back to you what's the difference enforces your privacy security is what is the layer that protects protects your privacy I guess
 so that's it that's a good answer so privacy is a thing you want right that that the you want your data or information what is a lot of different attributes but you want privacy and security is a way you get it together through security all the things you might want or Safety and Security is a way you might get that Social Security is a mechanism
 and it's been privacy is an in-state these are very very overloaded words and any definition I give like that you're going to find exception and we will We Will I said we want to be safe you want to say I want to be secure the security ends up being a process also and state their they're very overloaded words and I was fine if someone's asks like what's the definition of Acts it's almost looking for trouble cuz you get you're never going to find a definition that's truly satisfied because they are so true Core Concepts and such complex Concepts a year-and-a-half ago you wrote an essay called it's time to break up the NSA do you still feel the same
 yeah I do it a ten sack I'll give you the major problem the NSA has two very different missions basically protecting our stuff and attacking their stuff very very broadly and Emissions made sense to be together during the Cold War because our stuff and their stuff that you could attack a Soviet radio and defending American radio and it was the same technology and when you did one that didn't affect the other
 now the world is different everybody stuff is the same we're all using TCP IP and Cisco routers and Microsoft Office and chrome browsers releasing the same stuff and there isn't an attack cars
 tritac Bears defend hours dichotomy in the same way and so these two NSA missions are now hurting each other
 that when you attack There's You by definition leave ours vulnerable when you defend our as you by definition defend there's I think this should be broken up the anesthetic or an essay
 Espionage is what is is a perfectly reasonable thing that needs to be done and the NSA should focus on that government on government espionage
 let me let me go through the rest government on an individual surveillance is a police matter rightfully belongs in FBI like organization probably the FBI
 and and cyber defense really should be pulled out of the NSA and put into a much less secret much more focused defense organization and other one piece for the missing there is the attack piece which is now and rightfully belongs and US cyber command by part of the military
 is is that who originated stuxnet
 I don't think we know exactly which organization which is stuxnet right now the NSA and they are separate political but they are both in Fort Meade both run by an admiral Rogers so it's often hard to figure out what came from where sucks that I'm sure was a cyber command operation but when you say the word originated I don't think we we know it all
 when you think about it seems like the type that would take so much complex coordination between different branches of the military and of the government it almost necessitates they're being a a tight commingling between between NSA and the and cyber command say is because the technical
 expertise is so related that they need to be close to be think about difference between what the government call C & E computer network Espionage and see in a computer network attack it's all the exact same steps up to the very end which is either Copystar. Star or delete star. Star made so they are exactly the same but politically and legally they're very different in the reason you want to separate them is because they're very different tools are policy perspective and having them clothes I think Muddy's that but you're right that that technically they they are basically the same
 how did stuxnet affect your perspective on Cyber War
 I love it did it it surely is an example of it but it's not an example that is surprising in any way that it is a really is the first military raid cyber weapon we saw I watched but it wasn't science fiction it wasn't surprising it was kind of regular and it's a good example it's a good story to talk about I don't think it really changed thinking that what you think it changed thinking in the internal government military discussions cuz it's certainly
 easier for you and I to say no no blood was shed change the tenor I think it did because it demonstrated the power of a cyber weapon and you're right it was largely successful there was some collateral damage and their networks around the world that were affected by stuxnet but not a lot you could argue that was that was successful but it really did demonstrate that a Target side weapon could achieve the same goals that a missile strike or a bombing run could with less loss of life and less other damage so I in some ways I think that was a really good demonstration notches in the u.s. was around the world
 what are corporations involved in the creation of stuxnet we don't know probably not it does seem that the government had assistance from Siemens which is a company that built the controllers that stuxnet attacked but unclear that Siemens knew exactly what they were assisting
 I don't we don't know about any contractors that were involved in the building of stuxnet
 so that's a known on the probably were silly because the tracks inside the NSA inside cyber command are doing this work but we do not know of any Court involvement in any detail from Google and Amazon become very active as military contractors as engineer question I think they are almost by definition not trying to contractor is is surprisingly difficult and I work the military contractors it's kind of a good thing you have to have the expertise to navigate the military Government Contracting process and that is a unique skill-set it is if companies like Google and Facebook are doing military work they are likely doing it
 through some other contract I going to make this up Raytheon as a Government Contracting and Google works for Raytheon that really feels bad and not likely but we know there's cooperation between government and those companies probably mostly under under duress and under actual coercion is that accompanies really do have a strong Imaging in not cooperating with the government I forgot we know that Facebook shares its photos with the FBI you know that Google responds to lots and lots of legal wiretap requests every year but yeah I just don't see them getting into the military industrial complex business because it's such a separate business government though just does that border on becoming a military contractor or is it is it segregation of concerns enough
 understanding the paperwork and the paperwork the hard part and and they're not government pay door companies so you're certainly they could provide assistance to the General Dynamics contract that's doing that I just don't see them as being government contractors it's such a different world Cree Singley powered by Google or Amazon or whoever else is actually better at Raytheon I don't know who's giving you can you tell data center frame for the NSA it's not Google it's not Facebook and I'm not convinced this data and data center building expertise is so rare these really feeling a big data he's been doing big data since before big day and it was Big Data so yes there's a lot of expertise in the corporate world
 and yes I am sure that if there was massive contract to build a government answer then and there are government data centers the big contractors would get expertise from these companies but I don't know if they do it as is
 you're feels more like to be done within a traditional government channels
 these corporations like Google are doing is that they're at their has been released have shown how some ways that they are expanding the government surveillance we started to see these documents a while ago with it with Snowden disclosure closures today how have things changed corporations working with the government to expand the surveillance
 so it was such a short industry and we know for example that there's a normal operation AT&T in the NSA in this is a subject of a republican New York Times story a few weeks ago and we've seen a lot more of it in the Snowden documents but there's an enormous cooperation between telcos and the NSA mean in the UK between BT British Telecom and the UK's and I say a lot of operation and they've been cooperating for the Cold War operation isn't new and end this cooperation is better stop your lines lettuce access your facilities access things you're doing another country's is a lot of that quad operation there's less so with more of the modern-day to alligators the Facebook's and the Google's who don't really come from that tradition of of government cooperation and arf
 anymore although you're there data is used a lot by by government
 yeah either through coercion
 or through a fact or any of the other bribery any of the other ways government gets at at this data
 manifest is it like
 play courses comes into the plug in this wire is this change in engineering happening examples of all of it we see asking nicely ANS I go to AT&T and saying hey can we plug it into your data center AT&T signature put in that closet over there don't tell anybody we see bribery and NSA going to RSA secure and saying I hear ten million dollars you wish to make this algorithm a default
 we see threats and then we see actual legal compulsion whether it's the FBI going to pee and saying give us this data to you no more General no make these changes in your systems so it's really kind of all over the map then and different different tools are used and I'm sure that targeted against different different companies and if we don't like it
 we aren't seeing many it's it's we are seeing a lot more nobody's biggest Stone stones are once in a lifetime they could Sone some we got so much but there are many people leaking government documents
 in the United States many is like maybe a half a dozen dozen like I try to keep track of three hard who are not snowed some of these could easily be be corporate employees we don't know but it still was a carpenter play
 but no one that big we haven't seen a major whistleblower to hear all the documents the closest we've seen is the outsider we believe who went into hacking team hacking team is cyber weapons arms manufacturer sells surveillance an attack Weaponry to a lot of countries you know you I give you the list you say Chinese guy shouldn't really have the sort of stuff they use it for human rights violations to arrest people for torturing bad stuff and that person broke into hacking team released everything that's similar that seems to be an outside or not an Insider we we haven't seen a major whistleblower from a US defense contractor getting the data from how do you determine whether or not something you are doing is
 being an engineer in a spot like kind of like in Snowden spot it doesn't feel totally legitimate do you have any tips for how to develop a philosophy that is sort of strong enough to understand where the breaking point between your personal ideology and the requirements of your engineering job
 yes it is a good question but it's not really a question for me you are seriously how do I get to Mobile Compass I don't know right I talk to her start in I don't know how to get a Mortal Kombat still need something people should have I'm a fan of all compasses but my ex expertise in how to develop one you are not hopefully
 see myself as a technologist
 hey Mommy my background is cryptography that back on his nest computer science
 into computer security and really only lately in my career have I moved into the economic social security of psychology security Now the sociology and politics of security by but now I've I've never been if I take a class B classes in college but never been lost her because a lot of times you can say syllogistically aliens to be least to see Lisa D and is sometimes something that you know seems totally unrelated particularly in the engineering world where things are really complex and so maybe it does I will defer to you
 but let's talk about the engineering then what are some best practices what are some things engineers should keep in mind when building secure systems so I'm going to. Not because of the bad question because the last thing when they should keep in mind is do not listen to advice on radio shows in the internet This is complicated this is this is hard people get graduate degrees in this stuff and if and then to keep in mind that I'll let a little bit of advice picked up here and there is not going to be enough keep in mind this is hard and fast all the time on interviews what are the five tips for this one of the six ways to do that any one of these list is bad any one of these here's how to be safe is it going to be in complete and what we're learning again and again and again this is so uncomplicated and if you think you got it right you better know why you think that
 Exquisite card system don't do too much don't assume that you know something it's certainly end what we learn again and again is that that's security is less about what you think of and what about you didn't think of this makes this hard you wrote yesterday internet-enabled refrigerator for man-in-the-middle attacks conversation with Vince Cerf who is a turing Award winners in Pioneer and he said he was worried about refrigerators launching a denial-of-service attack on a bank in the future
 but not refrigerated per se but it's it's things that end this is something that Decor doctor I said I love you put it very well we've moved the world of things to World of computers that do things to her frigerator isn't actually refrigerator anymore used to be now it's a computer that keeps things cold that your car is a computer with 4 Wheels in an engine your smartphone is a computer that makes phone calls your thermostat is going to be computer that keeps your your house is temperature regulated in all these are computers and adds computers they have all the power of regular computers just probably without the screen in the keyboard and they have all the vulnerabilities of regular computers so just as a hacker can can build a zombie network of computers to attack a bank a hacker can build a zombie network of other things to attack a bag and those things will include refrigerators and toasters and thermostats and all the Internet of Things
 thanks and because they are much more limited use much lower cost much more poorly designed etc etc there likely be much more vulnerable so when will Vince Cerf says he's worried about his refrigerator is attacking a banquet is really sad thing is is proliferation of embedded low-cost computers that people aren't paying attention to our just as vulnerable as the big computers and can be used for the same things
 are there the same type of processors build IRT systems that are are not susceptible to this type of problem
 these things boxes are made to be low-cost they're made to be small and cheap and nobody wants to two-bit have a computer light design process devices have no update path your home router likely can it be updated in the Haswell abilities that cannot be fixed the way you update your home router is you throw it away and buy a new one which is kind of unacceptable and right now what is a multi-million car factory recall I forget which company because they have to update their software and the way they have to do it is in the factory at the dealer
 the Tesla cars have the same vulnerability they pushed an upgrade over the air to all their cars while people are sleeping
 that's the difference that these devices just aren't built with this kind of security life cycle in mine and of course we could do it we have to recognize that we want to do it and we have to recognize that it's important I don't want to get paid to do it in and so far we haven't shown any of that willingness
 put these processors in refrigerators and cars and thermostat increasing the attacks surface vulnerabilities faster than improving our utility
 and you know I'm sure bring utility even faster than the other otherwise you wouldn't actually doing this we are definitely creasing our tax service Recreation of all abilities in this this
 vulnerability a talking about earlier this week where are the Samsung refrigerators had a interaction with your Google account and cause of all the bility I mean there's an attraction between two things but the utility of these of these computers are so greatly but it's a nest thermostat or computerized car need some of its kind of weird to me that refrigerator is that a lot of this is very valuable no I don't think we are
 increasing our risk faster than wearing creasing are utility but we are definitely recent arrest
 I want to come back to data and Goliath and related topics do human analysts play in the comprehension of these big data Collective processes do we still see if I need your purpose for a lot of reasons and Facebook Google could you almost out of data and they use that to deliver personalized ads no humans are involved in analyzing that data and honestly if they have a 1/3 error rate so what I installed better then showing an app to everybody so advertising can tolerate a very high error rate if it is approving a loan
 the average you want it is a lot less 01 Ford air ride would be a disaster so maybe you have a fully automated process that has exceptions that it looked at by people now on the other hand the government might use this data to watch drone strikes and think I could kill for that a false positive is actually really really bad and they are you going to need a human in the loop every time so it depends a lot on who's using data and for what purpose they'll always be ways where the date is usually automatically and will always be ways where the data needs some kind of manual check intervention massaging or something
 but the show is typically about software engineering we've been talking more about Kai the higher-level implications of engineering at place like the NSA or or Booz Allen compares to a place like Google
 yeah it is I think it's interesting there is a lot of XP in both places certainly the NSA is going to have attack expertise that Corporate America doesn't have because you know we don't need it a defensive expertise I think is it will be strong at both places I'm not convinced that the NSA will have any secrets that a Google won't
 but there are certainly differently we see this in the NSA documents that the attack tools going to say your building are very sophisticated cuz they actually have budgeted Manpower at attack tools which we don't
 we've seen the power points for these back and data collection and processing systems I'm curious how well implemented those systems are cuz I specs for systems in within corporations where it's like we don't know we have no idea you don't see the details score and we see we see the question the structured query language we've seen really saw that the guts on how that works looks very well designed but we just don't have enough visibility into the details to know how well the thing is working practice
 buttstock xkeyscore to it's such a good specific example there was a movie recently that came out and they talk the talk a lot about xkeyscore in it what is xkeyscore that it is a singular database + query language + data visualization console that will allow an NSA analyst to query individuals keywords to look for people of certain characteristics i-83 the most sophisticated query tool and if I almost have one stone in the beginning he would say something like from my desk I was able to smile on anybody including the president or something like that he said it and it was wildly dismissed he was talking about xkeyscore and the more we see about what we see he was right that's a minute desk he was a boy
 how to do all of that that was using excuse for that keeps a Rollin buffer of data of course it can't store everything is just too much of it so datastore for 30 days 60 days longer if it's certain kinds of data but it allows Seattle to do very complex queries I was looking at some of the reports machine it's things like going to tell me anybody from Syria who searches for these websites from 2 to 4 in the morning but I want to know everybody who talked me into Ukraine and Moscow using pgp
 no shorts or thinks you can even query with xkeyscore
 conflict that is developing between the US and Isis battle but also information battle could could you give a primer on how the u.s. is approaching the eye of the Isis conflict I certainly can't I love to hear one though I certainly a big issue I can tell you where to go to get one I've been listening to the talk show the Aspen security Forum which occurred in August that handsome extremely high level Administration officials in counterterrorism in law enforcement current former talking a lot about things including the Isis threat and they are talking a lot about this I don't have I don't have anywhere near their expertise but I was just murdered listeners who are curious to go pull down the
 videos of the Aspen security Forum talks and panels that are really interesting
 just don't want to talk about the city do you think of this is like the nicest the nsa's tools actually have a practical use of these things made an estate tools have a lot of practical use in spying on a foreign leaders that thing to do with Espionage is important is important tool estate craft and we should minimize it so I never knew I was going to say stools questions really the target against Isis up but I don't know what the nsa's providing and if they don't really talk about it but I'm sure you take intelligence and tackled Harding intelligent who do we drone is it a large dbsa determined
 right so I'll begin to close off if you had any big philosophical changes about your beliefs and Security in the last 10 years
 Taylor story about you I'm action your number with your clarifying that 51012 generalizations and I got to start out in cryptography that computer security network security more job security technology lately I've been thinking about an economic security maybe 15 years ago so I already have the psychology security you 10 years ago and my latest works are the sociology security was a 2010 not wires and my latest book to be lazy political science social security and privacy so it's really my attempt to figure out what's going on to to generalize and understand what's happening and and there's anything that's really the changes
 snacks The Long Dark next book be about no I never know before I ride it
 how to set reading process work and is it just you you sit down and realize this is a topic I'm interested in the well I said you said I'll try to book but it's never the book I set out to write an army writing a book is is is exploring a topic so I will write with a topic in mind but often what I get will book look book end up being different I don't right front to back I'd write what I say is bottom to top or should I write pieces everywhere and then I keep moving them around trying to find the story find a narrative and he often takes me about halfway through the book before I understand truly what the book is about and then I just keep adding stuff all over and until I'm done
 any check journalism or whatever you want to call what you do Tech analysis I think it's a growing important topic doing it you're really good at it and do you have any suggestions for ways to be a responsible informative and entertaining and good
 researcher up Technologies and journalists of Technologies does technology and writes about it only secondarily I do for it on its own the door and and and secondarily a ride I would explain her which I think is why my writing resonates so well you know II don't have any good advice cuz I've never I didn't go down that path I should have just stumbled on this is what I do security topic on your mind that we have not discussed
 but answer the question I don't know I tend to a flitter about I don't really have important topics I'm I'm in right now I'm trying to write about about cameras and face recognition that just happens to be this week that's not an important topic anyone hit the internet of things which is important we hit the public-private surveillance Partnerships which is important we talk to Ben about security and power and some is organizational doxxing and cyber conflict so I think we were hitting the we're hitting the good topics did you see this recent thing where is like 250,000 iPhones there were jailbroken recently seen a flash the screen to the user that said you cannot use this iPhone anymore until you pay a ransom
 I did not that's anything so we're seeing more ransomware and it's it's now prevalent on computer they didn't know his coming to cell phones but again why not right there just computers
 right yeah I mean okay so real quick what it what are your thoughts on on walled Gardens I mean is that you know it's interesting to jailbreak your iPhone and then all of a sudden it's acceptable to Ransom where is this is this proof that the walled-garden approaches is is a is a good idea or does it just mean if it's the battery because it went to take it out of the garden has pluses and minuses has extremely security for buses that's it's not perfect and like anything if it's breached breached I don't really think it's a referendum on on the Walled Garden
 call gadzooks cuz it's a lot to learn about a dozen papers printed in my computer bag right now on bitcoin and how it works and some of the interesting things I think I have something to say about it which really is it's it's it's fragility that what we're learning is that Bitcoin is being broken not by the math and you're tired of me being broken I'll buy the stuff around that because I'm having to hack Bitcoin wallets and hack Bitcoin exchanges and all of these things around Bitcoin protocol if you need to make it work are the Wii clicks and it turns out that I having a a currency without a government backing it up is it is Ridge whiskey and I think that'll probably the first essay I'm going to write about Bitcoin it really has been I haven't had a lot to say it's been a huge learning curve and I'm head wasn't sure I wanted to go down it but I finally think I have something that no one said before so I am thinking about writing something by Beck
 that's great I can't wait to read that I did a week of shows I and I think kind of what you're saying is true and interesting it's like you get you have this utopian decent size platform and then organically pockets of centralization develop those are instantly the vulnerabilities and a and end in some ways you know it's
 it is a lesson that that as much as we try to get away from centralization but that we need it even around the edges so much for coming on software engineering daily it was a real pleasure talking to you and I'm a huge fan of your work so keep it up thank you

Transcription: 18f is an organization that is building the 21st century digital government in order to build online government services that have the high quality of modern Cloud applications 18f built Cloud. Gov a platform-as-a-service that can be used to stand up a web applications for divisions of the US government Aiden Feldman helped build Cloud. Gov and on today's episode he dissect its architecture Cloud. Gov is built on cloud Foundry which sits on top of a special version of Amazon web services built specifically for the u.s. government we also explore how application development works at 18f and how ATF has built a culture that reflects an ideal mix of public service and fast-moving Innovation if you are interested in sponsoring software engineering daily or if you want to advertise on the show please send me an email at software engineering daily at gmail.com if you enjoy this episode please share it on Facebook or Twitter the show grows by word of mouth so

 80 Feldman is a developer with 18f an organization that is building the 21st century digital government Aid in welcome to software engineering daily Jeff thanks for having me what is 18 F so it's enough is a digital development shop Indie General Services Administration so we are essentially doing development work design work Consulting type engagements on other kinds of things within the federal government for various agencies and we had a previous episode of with Sarah Allen where we briefly discussed the organization you want to talk about it in some detail with you how does the ethos and the internal atmosphere of 18 F compared to that of like a startup or a big company
 yeah it's interesting we operate a lot like a startup in the sense that we have a lot of freedom to kind of control our destiny on sense of how we want to be structure the kinds of projects going to take on Sarah and really redo operate like a business in the sense that we are cost recoverable so we don't have a line item in D Congressional budget we do all of our work for pay from the agency to work West even though we are government agents employees are cells so yeah model exactly but you know there is I think a big difference in terms of
 you know we're not only working for profit or we're not trying to maximize profit e then you know we're trying to be cost for comfortable that's nuts or like Financial goal but really where they are too and I improve how government does it and speaking of that when I got started what was the state of application development in and software infrastructure in the federal government yeah I mean you know I think it's yours every state government website you can sort of Imagine but you know despite how large the United States government has theirs surprisingly few people with design or no technology experience working in the government so you know there's a certain areas for that that's not true you know I told you I'd start certainly a lot of a lot of very very smart technical folks then like certain little groups scattered across agencies
 there's not a lot of expertise and house and so it ends up being a lot of young people who are running running various you know programs through agencies having to rely on vendors for expertise which is great systematic way of architecting and creating and deploying software applications prior to around Anytime ATM. Started right so there's nothing centralized now the the US government is very Federated and very siloed each agency kind of man does not on things the general Services Administration we work for you know what they do things like rent all the federal buildings and deal with acquisition for the year which is buying things for all the different federal agencies. I really wasn't wasn't much there in terms of
 kind of development help in our for it for these agencies and also you know platforms and things for them to it will ship out of software Cloud. Gov can you explain what cloud. Gov is in get into a discussion of the technology stack that 18f has built that absolutely so platform for and by the federal government so it is running Cloud Foundry which is open source platform-as-a-service and on top of that were able to go or where you're bored focusing on doing a lot of things around compliance so making sure that it's easy for
 Federal agency is to pay for and use it and still get through their compliance processes you know quickly and make sure they can run software secure late right so so government agencies for those who don't know can be extremely risk-averse and operating within a government often involves compliance because you kind of want you to have to adhere to those risk-averse I mean that risk aversion is there for a good reason for referral Legacy reason how does that compliance affect the type of software your building how does heat affect the speed at which ATF can operate yeah it's interesting so you know I think there's a couple things that lead to having license compliance happy environment the risk aversion is one of them you know if you're out of startup and you you fail you know you might you might be in the news but like no one really cares right unless you have shareholders Maybe
 federal government if you screw something up you make the front page of the Washington Post them called in front of Congress and it said it's very very high stakes and so you know I see you like a compliance which is a lot easier on a server serve rules that you have to go through to launch or operate software is best effort way to mitigate that nothing can be better in a lot of ways but that's where it comes from so trying to lunch offer and government you know that it's needed before you submit it publicly available by a process called like authority to operate and that's that's a lot of or trying to reduce the the burden of getting through that kind of date the advantage of deploying of having your own cloud if you're a company is kind of you can give more lip
 relation to the software developers me independent teams in your organization because if they need to spend up some machines need to run some kind of experimenting to launch an application that can just say hey we just machines as a service so explain how that sense of Liberation has affected software development in the federal government or at the at least 18 F level oh yeah I mean it's huge well you know outside of 18 1/2 in odd places that don't have access to you know what infrastructure directly and you know maybe don't have the expertise they have to get a contract to get a Datacenter or no space in the Datacenter they have to contract to get developers to build application they have to get contracts to deploy that application and operate that application and all of these you know that they made love some of those together but each of those is a
 Chipmunks bidding process and then you have to compete those and and I think a lot of you know what kind of problems with that. Process we're not able to necessarily for the contracts to the people who are best suited to do the job and so it's a very very long process and very expensive process to I watch anything and so being able to have kind of on demand infrastructures hugely changes that especially isn't something like a platform because you can give love that power the developers so are you cut a lot of the operating burden yeah cuz we're able to do that that's or Central Way what is the cloud service provider underneath Cloud Foundry in AWS and we're actually the process for just finishing up moving to I've got the cloud
 which is different than cloud back of the the the data center that Amazon built specifically for government applications exactly so it is AWS you know what has most of the AWS services that you know of like you know easy to an S3 and things like that but they do a lot to kind of Meet the compliance needs so you know I think it's maybe like the servers are only accessible by your people with citizenship or he says or something like that basically put a lot of like Protections in that are needed for like a specially now sensitive data that government might have
 okay and so why did you use to show you have these these Cloud servers are running an Amazon cloud data center why did you build an additional platform on top of that using Cloud Foundry I don't know if you've ever tried to set up a server from scratch but it's kind of a pain even even with virtualization you're still giving you know what Xbox you have to configure it you have to install security patches you have to make sure that you know only the right ports are accessible Etc it's really a nuisance and you know what that ATF alone we were finding that and that's what that's what we're doing when we first started and
 there's a lot of overhead and there's a lot of kind of dependence on our very small operations team to you also provide that expertise just to get your new environment running for turn application with a platform-as-a-service the developer can just say like push this app to a new to new environment and it just kind of works so it did kind of democratizes that's my expertise in the sense that developers are able to serve their own needs better Amazon also has its own platform-as-a-service products why did you choose to layer Cloud Foundry on top of the Amazon infrastructure instead of using Amazon's platform-as-a-service products
 yeah so we we did it all you ate a lot of options the time but yes or a commercial offering sounds an open-source ones and you know what the with us all in one platform you get Thunder Independence is one big thing so was Cloud Foundry they have different sore throat doctors that the end-user for the most part doesn't have to even be aware of what the underlying environment that is so you know if you were running directly in Amazon that's going to be a big change going from you know using am eyes and in one place to using you know after you know whatever they're at their corporate says machine images and you build up a lot around your vendor dependence and I think that's been a huge problem for government in the past so he will have that flexibility is huge and also does things like allow us to
 for your services that Amazon doesn't so for example if we wanted to offer like a couchdb service you know what just say we could call Country allows you to create that sort of distraction where you say you know cheers how to create a new couch TV instance and you can just provide that as like a but they called The Marketplace know when you can create add-ons in that way that are accustomed to be able to do so interesting things there around offering customer thinks ability and it also reduces the switching cost in case you wanted to change the core infrastructure over to Google or Amazon or digitalocean the future sure and similarly yeah there's there's veteran dependents for itself so you know we can for example move from Amazon East where we are now
 took off cloud and the tenants for the most part yeah that will have to do some manual cement at work but they won't have to go make much change into the application also using an open-source platform which is very popular gives Independence to those applications so if an application can run in town. Gov it can run with almost no extra effort in any of the commercial providers that run Cloud Foundry if if Cloud the Amazon data center offering for governments that serves compliance things so it can't run did they can't have certain platform features because they would violate compliance but couldn't you theoretically build any of those things on top of your Cloud Foundry your gum your Cloud. Gov layer like could you potentially violate those
 clients issues at the higher level so it's not so much that it's like certain Technologies can it be used it's a lot around like who can access the servers how are deployments managed
 yeah a lot of it is around like did integrity and then security so because we're running Cloud Foundry in those were moving to running clubs in those walls were able to answer any offerings that we want and yes of course you could do this at the infrastructure layer and kind of build your own attractions there by using a certain unified platform provides a really nice look consistent experience for users sure process cuz to Amazon obviously one this contractor I'm not sure if you guys chose them or or if you were evaluating Amazon and Google and Azure and you just decide on Amazon what was that process like how did you come to the conclusion in Amazon was what you were going to be running on
 yeah so this happened before I got 80 now so I can't speak too much to it but for purchases like that
 what about the government has to do is just very hard for the government to pay sort of usage fees so it works in the sort of interesting way where you go through a third party and you're essentially allocating a large amount of money to buy this software for certain amount of time so even though Amazon charges by usage we basically have this large fun like
 we are boarded with this contract as a soar like an upper limit right so like we dedicated a certain amount of money that the government can't there laws against like committing the government she was sort of indefinite amount and so it has to work in this you know seemingly backwards by where you know you you set aside like a fixed amount of money to use
 business offer that starts by usage but as to why Amazon was chosen versus something else that I can speak too much too that would be open or it's just not your wheelhouse yeah I'm not sure about that we have you know not only tall person designer whole division are dedicated to acquisition so not only buying software for ourselves to be at you know infrastructure but yet you know licenses for desktop software that kind of thing but yeah this is right so yeah
 you're not only are we doing this or your byes for ourselves we are doing want to work with outside agencies to do what are called like you know ghost RFP is so a ghost writing I request for proposal basically you're writing up their requirements that they can get better software and helping me a kind of design better ways to four other agencies to buy software so we're trying attacking do you like government's you know I T challenge for multiple angles in of trying to do better butter development offer better platforms but also you know we don't we try to cut out Private Industry by any means and so we're also trying to make it easier to buy better software and better better fenders
 okay so this is a vendor and Cloud competitive contract competition discussions it was over at 8 and I want to spend up a server I've got an application I want to deploy maybe it's for the IRS maybe it's for the transportation department or something so how do I speed up a server and deploy an application to Cloud. Gov how does it differ from how am I do that if I'm at a company that has its own cloud
 yes I mean using essentially off the shelf cloud Foundry customization is built around it but using hot. Gov is just like using any other cloth Honda Rider from the male perspective so I must command line tool and that provides pretty much everything that the developer would need in terms of employment so you know you're able to chew St push local files that uses something to drive for micro Cruz Bill pack system where you know you'll have to pay a bill pack for different Frameworks in different languages and I'll try and make up for the best gas about what
 freemark or language is being used run the appropriate installation commands things like that it's all dependencies and then start up the server but really all delete all permits to do is say you know CF push and it's a really yeah that's really impressive system is that's quite seem Austin able to do things like you know configuration in configuration of code in the sense that you can you specify okay I want to host running and I want it at this domain and I want these Services connected and I want these environment variable set and things like that and you can check all that into files in your repository and so you're able to Newcastle reproducibility in that way
 let's walk through an example of how an application God created in an 18ft just may not understand this process confused like describe the process of 18f interacting with some other government organization the other government organization says hey we need X built 18f starts designing it starts pecking it out starts working with software engineers and designers and project managers and take me through that process from the beginning to end from just a high-level a lot of high-level points so we
 you don't act like it's an example of a specific short-term to do anything really so let's say the Federal Election Commission might approach us and say we want you know our website rebuilt ennui wants maybe they just say that with an intake process where we help them kind of better articulate what their needs actually are and understand their help them understand their budget a timeline that they might have what sort of Staff they might need to achieve that you know if there any special skills etcetera and so after that process there's a you know is that contract signed to call dinner agency agreements that basically
 can I watch the kids money for this for this project from their budget with and stuff up a projects and that'll often involve we call it a discovery Sprint to kick it off and that will be yes or driven by user experience folks but have your the engineer's the product. Of people and everything involved to you know even better understand the problem so you don't interviewing either if it's replacing some things this thing you know interviewing current users are current operators if it's you know doesn't exist yet of the Greenfield projects now don't talk to people who they think will be using it using a project and understand their needs from there on the 18th at block is this app recently 18f helped build the was a college scorecard this is a project that allows students and parents to make more info
 choices about what college to go to in this is this is a perfect example of an app that might easily get by a Seas baked into it or problems if it were developed by the private sector so it's really like the perfect example of an application that would make sense for the government to build explain how the development of the college scorecard app Winx I think that that would help minimize some of the some of the the process use that you're discussing so you know I wasn't directly on that project but no for those who don't know it's a website offered by the Department of Education to provide basically better provide students and families with better day. To make informed decisions about college so it will do things like tell you you know what is the average income for this degree for the major from this college in 5 years 10 years
 what are the average
 yeah sucks on a student loan burden or what's what's this word that that people have coming out of this college and so we're certainly a lot of Private Stock offerings in terms of you know how to make decisions about college the government has a surgery unique
 perspective and I use a unique opportunity to provide a lot of the data that the government collects so uses things like IRS data uses things like in the Department of Education date of course then makes it all available so there's a tool to Natalie president of you can also download the raw data sets and using API so I think a lot of those
 if private offerings to now be improved because they have better access to the underlying data and so it's a sort of win-win for everyone I think the most recent project that you have worked on that you helped launch
 yes I've been on cloud that guy for like 4 ish months the project I worked on before that for my first year teaching F was RC to and that was a project to
 help purchase workflows in government so if you want to buy a stapler in government you have to get like two to six signatures which is yes in this is for snow go to work all like small purchases so under $3,500 so that process was all based in paper and you know phone calls before hand and the other tricky thing is that fair for those kinds of purchases you need to keep a record of all of those not by the transactions but also the authorizations for 3 years past when the purchase was made and so is this really difficult like bookkeeping problem you know for individuals for people who are like doing maintenance on buildings or whatever you know they didn't want to worry about this stuff then it's also difficult for auditing because you're the information was scattered you know the person might not work there anymore and the person you want me not remember
 top 3 years 3 years ago and I called
 like spreadsheets and Oracle things before or not even at this I'm saying it was like people have to dig up old emails and you know probably look at my phone records and you know write things down from memory I was like that would have been that would have been a good start so the idea was to busy have a central air system for doing the car purchase pure Walmart close and keep all the information in one place so that not only is it more efficient for people making the purchases in the people proving a purchase says yeah that they can see for example what are all the outstanding purchases are made her even to answer basic questions like how much money is my dependent Department sending you this quarter and those kinds of things cuz I think
 some of the day maybe the pain but that's the only way this kind of mine that you know Silicon Valley people might have for government is like the go they don't have these processes in place and I'll have the right kind of software that get things done and 18 solving that exact problem it's greasing the wheels in these places where you can't even imagine that these types of slow down Whitaker but yeah you have to do bookkeeping to acquire stapler like this type of process is it has the auditing process is in place for a reason and it's it's just unfortunate that the way that things have developed you know there's a lots of manual processes and that's that's the beauty of 18 f is it is this this kind of like put grease in all these little gears that that are the government bureaucratic machine and overtime if you just
 get lots of speed up especially because it sounds like but it sounds like the type of thing that it's it's not like you're going to need like a continuous like a monitoring and devops team assigned to it to handle the outages and keep 24-hour up time and everything is just like the simple application to write it once and it's kind of like solve this problem forever
 yeah absolutely I mean coming into government was really surprised like that you know the problems really aren't technical like even that up that I'm describing which you don't have some like business logic and sort of like different rules for how things get power Quest get routed and things like that like it's a rails app like it's not like we're not talking like a really complicated thing here I'm in most of the projects that we build our clocks that excites actually so like the technology is not the challenge and I think there was some real surprising to me and Rose passed you a lot of people coming in as that you know it's really how do you navigate the bureaucracy how do you help people in government be comfortable with things like working the open are using open-source or
 yeah I like having their data being made available that kind of thing so you don't even for developers I think you you have to have and also build a lot of knots and empathy for the other people there working government who want to do good work but yeah that's you were saying or just kind of mired down in this kind of layers and layers of regulations that. Make it really difficult to work efficiently and effectively baked into how you act it's it's really hard to see another way until one example of this is like a podcast for example my workflow for downloading new podcast I listen to tons of podcast and the work is so weird because it's this weird Legacy thing that's been around for like 10 or 12 years but hasn't really Advanced very much is like you have to open this podcast player yet to keep like I don't know. Tons of
 20 Gigabytes of podcasts on your on your phone is like this is really make a whole lot of sense in the answer is probably no but it's you know it's easy to to not have that frame of reference because you just been dealing with this infrastructure for so long and I imagine that there are a lot of people in government who are just so used to it they don't eat their kind of like maybe blind to these efficiencies the could be could be created in the 118f unlocks it it's just you just get just get huge returns in productivity advantage to having the right of we are coming in from the outside you don't not only to 18/2 but also not
 jumping station in I need agencies that we're working with right and so yeah we're coming in with some sort of fresh perspective at the same time you know there's a lot of dumb an expertise and there's a lot to be learned from the people nose agencies who want to you don't work better they just don't have the resources to do so and so that's sort of like marrying and and kind of being humble and listening to what we can learn from them you know I think results much better products and we're going to bring you know that technology activities and things like that. Stephanie mix image was like the static site but there's lots of people in the government lots of organization in the government uses static static website and you built the ATF helpful this platform call the Federalist platform it's just helps helps people launch static websites to could you talk a bit about this platform and explain why you built your own kind
 sounds kind of just publishing tool why couldn't you just use WordPress
 yes I mean there are a ton of websites that use Drupal and WordPress are two very you know popular options and those are definitely out there you can definitely do that and actually yes I ate me out of our agency it offers a kind of like a WordPress and WordPress solution that yes and watch it so I can say things you can't whip like GoDaddy or you know the commercial providers but offered by the government you know we saw an opportunity for
 might not even simpler right in that there's no database there's no no running code you never have a performance problems or things like that
 yeah I'm so able to offer you that hosting in that Circle processors that excites but also a you know user-friendly editor that allows them to you know focus on editing content not have to worry about young designer layout that kind of thing is even heavier than what you need to deliver such what these what is company what these different organizations within the government actually need another option that you know before I was even last like operational
 true Focus then then work last night speaking of the operational side of things you give itaka Toscana on and one of the things that you discussed was how difficult it is to find devops people who can work in government to it being hard to get devops people hired 18f you explain that process explain why I mean obviously you have your own cloud so devops is important I would explain why it's so hard to hire people why why Jeff up to so important for 18 and 1/2 really the problems are not are not specific to Tops though I think the band for Dobson Industries high so that you know worked were competing with tech with tech companies or other organizations I'm so that makes it you know heart equally hard is it
 but you know hiring and governments especially For Engineers especially is difficult because we have you know much longer kind of turnaround time for hiring then yeah a private company would so
 we are using the bus or specialist hiring Authority the last I heard much quicker than you know them a lot of other parts of government and what some trade-offs of that we have a maximum term length of two years that's renewable to four years
 but even that takes the average hiring which is you know 9 to 12 months for the rest of government
 software Engineers are always looking to automate their work software automation let us get more done with the same number of resources investment automation works the same way wealthfront is an automated investment service that relies solely on software to acquire and manage client accounts traditional Investment Services have many humans in the loop advising clients and taking fees the problem with these older advisory Services is that the advice that the services are applying is off so systemic that a computer could give the same answer or an even better answer wealthfront takes a new approach with software-driven automated investment it provides better returns through software engineering go to well front.com SE daily to get a special offer for our listeners $15,000 managed for free when you open the

 to tell me
 some about how to teams at 1804 structured how does does project management project blow work how does the like once and applications up what is the maintenance go give me an idea for how teams were
 sure so I attempt structured as so chapters are bissli bicycle so there's a sign out. There's acquisition and then there's
 blockchain strategists SSI people strategy on the business unit side we have a custom partner Solutions which are things that we are you don't build a custom for agency and then heading off to them ideally we have transformation which again is that so scratchy strategy kind of work we have products and platforms are we back was Ash on that side also and then called learn which is essentially like training resources so
 which episode of a matrix in the sense that you know what an engineering we have teams that are you know supervisor is so you know right I meet with Jody the five or six years of my team every two weeks or so you have to check in and see how things are going but I'm not necessarily working with them everyday so people from engineering and design are together all the different project James you know so project team will last for 1 to 12 months let's say on a project in the most people are just on time and so yeah so deep deep sir projects come into this business units and then I stopped from the different chapters 18 x software is open-source I'd save 98%
 we do have one big project that was that we brought in before we confirm lies that are open source policy that they've been trying to get open source Mesa since the beginning but I run into a lot of you know it's just hard to make it a priority I guess so that's that's being punished for but really almost everything he does and he barely ever
 do anything improper repositories
 the the how does how does ATM overcome be kind of like notion at all if it's open source maybe there's no exposed security risks like anybody in the open can see how these government tools are working and potentially have security breaches is that a complex discussion to have with your people who may not be well-versed in how open-source works
 yeah this is what I've been thinking about yeah there really is a lot of like fear and uncertainty from the cloud because it's security risks when in actuality it's kind of counterintuitive but there are fewer security wrist if you're in the cloud right yeah I mean I think a lot of it is sharing their concerns your not having a sore knee jerk reaction and
 Kenneth making them feel make me feel you working with you ignored but I think we do you know have good answers for and I'm hoping we can you know what to write down good answers for a lot of these things so for example like security of Open Source software yes you can see if I don't know what is there also a lot more people looking at it to find and fix security vulnerabilities read the possibility one coat is out in the open and so the you we also have like some very good you have some very good things that we can sight now to support this. For example of Memo from the apartment defense in 2009 I believe saying that you know close source is not inherently more secure than that security by obscurity is not a valid argument and so we're able say things like that and you know what the dod Department of fence that something around security people tend to listen and so
 yeah I think a lot of it is kind of a kind of building up you know president and saying you know here look at all the places from using government very effectively and you know. She's a part of it and whatever and I think a lot of it again it's just the fear of you know kind of being a first-mover and you know not want to take on that risk but if they see that other people are taking on this rest and I'm done fine
 it's yeah that's often enough when you have this this huge Library open source software that the government can use it seems like I mean could could other governments potentially just like for for Katie Neff and like start using it for their own internal processes cuz I imagine like everybody every government needs an internal auditing process to track who bought a stapler right yeah I mean you know the more we talk to other governments more I realize how not unique these problems are so
 yeah I mean we have a circle and a cup for example the digital transformation office in Australia is looking to do something very similar and we sort of went point-by-point of like okay well here's the special thing that we don't reply. Gov because compliance and then we need that too and then okay here's another thing that we need for security reasons not to and so it's really just a lot of opportunity there for reuse and I think the better that were able to document things automate how to make things and make them he's a stand-up tomorrow or reuse for going to get any more able to
 damn in the future collaborate I'm going to there are a few examples of H&M products that other governments are using one being on analytics - Republic facing analytics dashboard also the one we built this analytics. Usa.gov but which is a pretty cool side by the way I ordered listeners to check that out yeah but that's being used for forked and stood up by the city of Philadelphia I think like Anaheim maybe Anchorage like a bunch of cities and I think Norway Forks one of our income in Norway for 20 or sites and end
 yes it up and saw this I think there is a lot of opportunity for you since I hope it has her belly project before we have that sort of reuse of mind I'm thinking about you or how easy would this be to customize and can we know breaking out into your modules that don't make it easy to reassemble and not you know be very u.s. government specific
 is the trees by your perspective on the ethos of people who join 18 up because these are like super experienced super talented technologists that choose to go to government when they could go to work at anywhere in Silicon Valley they could go to Uber they could go to insert name here what is driving the people who go to 18f to work at this place where you don't get as far as I know I don't think you know that I may not be super competitive like a Google are Facebook what is the ethos of the people that are joining 18f
 so yeah I did you know there's a unique offering of startups you know obviously you can get amazing benefits great pay flexible work
 working in the in the government you could sort of unique opportunity to have enormous impact for Change and at a place of desperately needs it and so you know because things are so now bad technology-wise in the government every little thing you do is like oh my God this is amazing like this is so much better than we had before so yeah I mean it's just a really rewarding thing and I think we get a bunch of mission-driven millennial types of the last part so now we have to have a huge range of people on a large number of people 18 of have families you don't GSA agency is actually very beautiful by the way
 yeah it's not take the misconception up like we're all a bunch of like Silicon Valley like 20 year olds like that's not the case at all I'm actually here on the underside of 18/2 and I'm like 20 is so obviously not a millennial but she very much had an ethos that I think I see reflected in some of the millennial types that I see these days like where you work what the mission of what you are doing the higher-level mission is it's very important I think it has something to do with the fact that you know we've got to the point where the best thing that a human can possibly buy is a smartphone and that only cost $560 so beyond that where is your money going to get take you so if she comes much more important about like where you going to work what it what are those what are 8 to 10 hours of your day consisting of yeah I think there's also unit opportunity for eating at 18 1/2 of you know there a lot of nonprofits there a lot of other governments that need
 you know kind of technology and design expertise but you're 18 of houses of critical mass of people you know started by a bunch of people that are super talented not just sort of broaden wanted Friday more people that wanted to work with you in that caliber person so we actually have a like talented team and then experience team in that you know I have people that I don't manage technically that have run engineering teams before right now I would like don't know what I'm doing so it's like people are not there to you know climb the ladder the Sara Lee they're not there to you know take home a big paycheck that I think are part of salaries are you know for the most part competitive yeah it is people that want a supportive job once a new opportunity make a big difference and yeah our patient
 the new unique situation of your downside risk is protected cuz it's not like a start-up where you're you're potentially like going to run out of money but also you have this is totally totally on untapped ground in terms of what kinds of engineering things you can do is totally knew how big can a what is the larger picture of I don't remember exactly how 80s hits into the GSA and when the just the the technological Revolution it's happening at the government but how big can the movement within government debt or where is it going just the technology ization of government sure so you don't eat enough is that 185 people and we are two years old so we can grind
 very very fast I think you know we have plans to go to something like 215 your long-term I don't think they will just continue growing indefinitely and I think there's a certain yeah over certain size we get we can risk becoming like you're not not as at all that kind of thing so what an optimistic for is that
 Westside your Sturgill service or should I sort of sister team in the White House that they're actually there big projects is standing up digital teams in agencies so where we are being somewhat Independence and you're able to work with a lot of it different agencies in an honest one off basis having teams are actually you know while while verse well aware of the problem specific to veterans in the problem specific education in the park specific to you know housing or whatever having y'all technologist designers in his agency as well allow them to you don't have much better sort of long-term
 achieving Improvement and that we can continue to exist to offer things like the shared services or offer you know
 expertise specific area where they might not have a tour to do to do prototyping or what-have-you so like I am a random developer in the United States and I want to contribute to government and I want to deploy an application I like I may be I make an open-source and then I deploy it on cloud. Gov servers is that a possibility probably not I mean we definitely definitely definitely wants contributors to our applications and you know we are a lot of thinking about how to make things easier to contribute to and more reasonable so we can have collaboration with outside entities I don't think like direct deployment to call back I was possibility there restrictions surrounds you know that you have to be a government employee to the point directly to its like. Gov domain for example I'm so we wouldn't want any just I want to be able to
 but I do hope that were able to
 you provide better kind of facilities mechanisms for people to contribute a heads-up to get that's involved like that would make sense for the government to deploy like its own email server like you got the you know you got Gmail but it's it's actually it's the government you know I can see that make it answer like a government spam detection program are these could you could you potentially see a government like creating these things that have historically been done by the private sector
 in some areas right like we're not we're not trying to replace all these private offerings you know we didn't want to run around and Center if we want to use an off-the-shelf like data center virtualization kind of level but we're able to offer things that are specific governmental top of that you know so I think having a mid-layer abstraction where you can tend to use vendors from the outside underneath and have that serve Independence is really lagging so much yes it does actually out for things like
 can Google apps for government I think they didn't they do the resign if I'm remembering correctly but yeah we do use that we use Google apps I use you know a lot of commercial 12 I don't think and I don't want that to change but having a having a broad array of offerings allows no more flexibility for agencies and so now they're able to if they have some sort of compliance need that they want to put on top of email that if there were an email offering from GSA now that they can compare that against the be sort of commercial providers and you know no better options
 sure I should I want to ask one or two more things about. So you know you're running on Amazon Cloud Foundry sitting between Friday sitting on top is there do you guys use containers is there any container management system that you're using yes so actually uses a container system that I think predates Docker if I remember correctly internally but
 For Better or Worse that's sort of the developers not even aware of that so when you deploy at it's built into a image and then that's what's wrong on the difference of the different names of runners in COD Foundry they did recently add Docker support and that's something that we are looking to add this year yeah there's a lot of surf compliance complexities there and that's with doing things episode of dual pack level in the sense where we're providing you know the version of Ruby and we're providing you with lots of Silent Library security patch we can deploy that throat centrally from the from the club outside and all apps benefit from that we have containers you lose some of that benefit in that you know I don't know what's wrong inside your container and its then sort of the developers responsibility to do those upgrades
 signs there it is something we want to support we just have to figure out some things like that so you're doing security scanning of containers is nothing working be looking into that kind of thing
 are we are we are we are using Docker for development on a lot of projects for using it for services that are attached to Club. Gov reusing it's heavily in Concourse which is like to see I have continuous integration system will use for cloud. Gov that's all that's all based around container so it is definitely being used around 80 -
 so I guess just to close off what is the Future Vision what are the things that you're a line around right now what are you working on right now at 18f you specifically yeah so I felt like I was my project and so we are focusing on getting a tramp authorization so now this is more compliance fun where the ramp is essentially a stamp that says you know this is cleared by this sort of like Central Authority as being the most secure system and update you know I checked all the boxes thanks need to do to Young meet the government-wide security requirements at least the FED ramps classified as security requirements and a lot of that is not moving to Godfather's is one of those things being sort of proof system approved underlying system for that I'm also doing a lot of work to lay around like security compliance so for it
 when you're launching software in the government you have to write up a lot of documentation saying like no cures architecture the system here is y yo here's how we're taking care of user management if that's applicable here is how we're taking care of your network security if it's off bookable but having things like Amazon and Cloud Foundry you don't know the things we were going around call John tree ticks carry a lot of lot of those requirements and so we're kind of tool called compliance masonry that allows you to essentially do documentation like you would build software packages so you're able to inherit from difference
 no other white patches the saying I'm using rails okay that takes care of csrf-protection and abusing Amazon's that takes care of making sure that you have a fire hydrant next to your server you know that's like it's like the kind of things that launching a static website you should have to worry about but at the moment but the developers shouldn't have to care about that they should just have to know okay one of the specific requirements for my application and you know what are the yes or no meaning rules I have to take care of it my level you'll get them using all these components and so of course yeah I mean in a few data Integrity as a very big thing at in government so you know I'm burning down that's not a great thing
 Yap says things like that and Out For Better or Worse they're the requirements and so you know at the very least we want to make it as easy as possible for systems be belts on top of it I understand conversation I am a huge fan of 18 app I think you guys are doing awesome work and I don't know anytime you want to come back on the show if you got the announcement or you want to discuss something feel free to come back on I'd love to have you sounds great thank you so much

 alexio is an open-source memory Centric distributed and reliable storage system enabling data sharing across clusters at memory speed Alexia was formerly known as tachyon how you on Lee is the creator of a Luxio how you on was a member of the Berkeley amplab which is the same research facility from which Apache Mesa and Apache spark were born how young also goes by Hy Hy welcome to software engineering daily
 thank you Jeff thank you for the invitation absolutely thanks for coming on that memory is a king and there's a trend that motivates you to say that memory is king So the cost of memory and disk capacity are both decreasing every year but only the throughput of memory is increasing exponentially so give some more color on this trend why is the growing throughput of memory so important to the Big Data stack
 yeah you black that's quick question so what we're seeing is that you said memory and disk price to song in America price goes down like by 50% every 18 months and on the other side increasing exponentially every year so why this is important because the day that is also growing exponentially so this means that the memory memory speed will keep growing along with a long would it take her outside crying so you can do more than access by exponentially more than I the same time that's the reason why this is a bit stranded so important why we're saying memories of the king and from unlocks your perspective because
 cities and we view Memory I say I say primary storage media and we we we design our architecture to be a memory Centric architecture to La Rouge memory performance as much as possible that's that's the thing I say and this trend like at the beginning about 2000 like wasps tree companies they start to large the memory adira aggressively and her into thought in 2010 around a Time the company like by you I like that like who got all this inside Giants you start to library in the memory aggressively as well and what we're seeing is now the industry in the hotel industry in moving into this direction and and we are they leaving memory Centric solution for storage
 before we get into talking about a Luxio in Moore death I would have first talked about file systems and storage to get a historical context in order to understand the breakthroughs that alexio makes the past a little bit historically we've had to make trade-offs along what is called the memory hierarchy you give a brief overview of how the memory hierarchy has evolved and how this relates to the modern Hadoop or the bottom Big Data stack
 yeah so traditionally all the store a lot of storage systems in history and the song list storage systems they have that they have their hair Rocky they all have the Rocky and give me inside of every single machine you have level 1 cash to a level 3 you have to run and then you have some stories to storage on your PC or laptop like I said stay like that so basically it just two people put hot data faster data in a in a higher layer in her Rocky and the average their performance that's that's what has been happening this has been true since the beginning of this of the storage systems so but what is that like a long way in Christ of the memory capacity along with that issue along with a popularity of the distributed computing as well as the increase increase of the Davis Eyes
 what we're seeing is that because of the laundromat Murray and it and it's a larger memory like like every single machine they have more memory space left for storage for storage so what we're seeing is that a lot of companies are buying machines with a 256 GB memory or even hotter bites memory or silver so will you have a like like silver we have a cluster of a type of service like a hundred service so you will have 50 gigabytes memory space in to manage for in to manage and it's very intuitive in the science that we need to have a storage system which it should be the star system which can leverage this try memory space like it's a very into
 awful people to be able to leverage this big and bigger memory size to do a memory Centric storage and computing
 and if memory usage is getting more appealing it is this mean that we should start migrating all of the functionality of disk to ram
 it's not it's not really like I like her removing tick from the picture per say it's more about like saying how do we learn the one more resources from dear I'm so since people you are on is great people will move more and more data data into the mammary an alarm with our life cheer storage people with Robert tomorrow by 60 oz while but in the meantime people now see more test HDD back up like a backup storage and it's not being removed from the picture of the functionality Domingo becomes different they serve a different purpose
 so let's start to talk more specifically about the use cases of a Luxio and how it works in the current Big Data ecosystem we have many Frameworks and they already leverage memory in certain ways but file sharing among jobs is replicated to disc because replication enables fault tolerance and there are always faults it distributed computing things are who break so what are the problems with the moving to replicate to disc and perhaps we should start with what are the prototypical types of of cases maybe spark jobs or a spark plus mapreduce job for in together where we need to replicate to Discount yeah so traditional ABC systems that use a replication to to store systems beer application to achieve the fault tolerance of the data
 so what we are really doing here is that like along with that new announcement we had last week what do I really do need that we see as you mentioned there's so many different competition framers in the meantime we are all kinds of a storage systems as well so what you can see is that from the storage perspective you have a I like I'm a Zombie like ice three you have a Google car storage you have EMC you have not have you have hdfs you have a cross and stuff from a red heart so yeah so what are you doing here is that we put our self between the is all different server persistent storage as we speak different different competition for in the middle and we praise a lot of benefit to the whole ecosystem is that relate to our customers so for example for example
 to the upper layer to the operator like her a map reduce like Spark by Presto all kinds of different competition Frameworks by working with a aloxi oh they can like Access Data from any storage what we say is we enable any framer or talk to any storage at talk to any data from a storage in the meantime we bring we bring a lot of performance benefit that's a benefit to the offer letter and to the Benson to lower layer similarly like we can
 if a storage work with us they can reach a lot of type of difference were closed and application anything supported by Alessia on top of us if I start system integrate with us they will be able to work with those with work with those invitations Red Rocks and and in the meantime in the meantime lot of performance Improvement that's that's all you are player on the lower layer and another cool thing is we call this is a future proven which means that no matter if you are a competition framer and if you look at the ecosystem there may be another storm system coming up and that their company made by another new star systems and the by working with a lock Co about you as long as the new storage also being plugged in into the alexio and and.
 like that that existing application will be able to access the data from the new storage systems you sort system immediately that's a strong benefit as well yeah okay so you mentioned the the top layer and the bottom layer that you're essentially opposite sides of where a Luxio sits in the stacks of soul axio is typically going to sit somewhere in the stack where below it you have hdfs or S3 or gluster FS are all these other types of of of a typical data storage and then a Luxio is this layer between that layer and the higher-level Frameworks like spark and mapreduce and flank or these other data processing framework so
 in order to get a finer idea of how a Luxio improves things and it just in case in case listeners don't don't quite understand some of my contacts so
 talk about how a a some sort of data science job perhaps or some sort of multi-step job where you have multiple steps of spark or a step a spark and then a mapreduce job working in conjunction and how that would work prior to alexio being in the hood up stack and how it would work after a Luxio is is involved yes that's that's a great good point so we thought I lost you I would not have asked you this different jobs they all interact with another storage systems actually what happens is that normal people need to move the data from different places on different star systems into one single star system and then a different jobs interact with a single storage system
 so you miss interaction as you said there are different jobs in our users environment the jobs could be reaching in one frame or could be written in mottville framers as well so when when they need to share the data they have to read and write through a storage at you imagine such as Amazon S3 or like hdfs or like EMC not have storage and sharing process is a slow a slow and the ETL process from Storage into this one single storage slow as well as complicated and time-consuming So Weird Al aseel what we can help he is not so you put a lock Co between the competition Frameworks as far as the different star systems in the middle would present a unified
 space Chihuahua player to our a player likes park like a cow produce flying by so so they can start from different star systems in the in the meantime because we have a nice memory Centric architecture by the way. Clair to interact with data stored in our space so it's a costly like ETL process and the meantime we provide a very high throughput to our operator to interact with the data so many different jobs different application jobs in different competition for Androids to be able to share the data very efficiently
 high performance so that's with us became different play talk more about the API or the the file system that at the file system protocol that you use to present this unified namespace two different Frameworks yes that's that's great so for the API we fly different API for people to access data from us we have a native like false the baby I so it's not as a Chihuahua like bosses ATI or an application can interact data can interact with or without using our system ATI why the best performance as well and on top of that with your other APS as well for example we have a Hadoop compatible false false it to make you as well
 any application or any frame work as long as they can work with her as long as they can work with a hot tub faucet if you are they can work with us transparent without any color change and that's what that's a second example to be from 1.0 release we have a fuse ATI Oswalt wife is hsy work between us and idea so in a few applications applications to be able to interact Access Data from us so that's a fuse API and what's more interesting is that we also provide a version of the p-value API in the woman out release
 so that means that people can also using TiVo interface to interact I lost it when I Lost You from 1.0 and we are working with a like very bake liked while users to to to improve this feature along the way and I just gave some some examples and you can think of like an hour later people can easily you're the more AP ice on top of us to provide different ways to access data and we usually in car and encourage that you call system to do this to me why the more ways to access the data of promise that means that you bigger access more data from different storage at the high-speed and wheat we're seeing people are buting different ways more like particularly suitable for dog to access access data
 okay so what we've been talking about a sort of the interface between a Luxio and the things that operate on top of it so let's talk some about what happens beneath a Luxio alexio has under FS which is a file system that interact with S3 or hdfs or these traditional in storage systems so so what is under FS first of all was everything I said API from our side from our from a from bottom of a lock Co to be able to interact with any storage system so under storage system from our perspective the layer below is the layer below alexio and anti weed
 out from all prediction we really want to work well with a lot of different other star systems that's based on the need for an hour from our users and it's just very simple. You can see different users that we have different storage system to Pride in their environment and we just want to help them to be able to live. So
 search up to make a SIM card under store system from our perspective any storage the user house and they can be performed at all under storage and we can load and save data into it and to our users to our users it totally transparent and we will handle the capacity to walk with this our solar system like these different storage systems what is the cost of what are the what are the commonalities between those different types of interactions like under FSA imagine the under FS interaction between S3 has some similarities between under FSA interactive hdfs but I imagine they're also difference is so maybe you could give some granularity on what is the relationship between under fs and these different storage systems
 yes definitely so yes they are different different different properties and and they have a different performance characteristics and we would normally like a lavish the existing infrastructure in our users environment and then we enable more ways to access the data for for that particular storage in the user using varmint provided by the performance and definitely for different storage systems like Amazon S3 has a different property line hdfs from and see if I have a different property line Flagstaff crafter store across their file system so that's
 all tool they use cases in most cases that's why I was actually uses environment if they already it's a they really value the performance of Barry like a high performance on their storage if they don't care they may choose a cheaper solution that some more up to like after our users and in the meantime depends on their requirements from our side
 a dolphin tale with different on the story systems we have type of some different integration as well for Sota under storage system we have a more primitive integration because it's too early for student other on the storage systems because allow the user request we may have a different aggression with a different generation doesn't way it can cool the performance as well as a reliability but we have many programs on the going for on this front

 now that we've talked about what goes on above alexio and what Kahan below Alexia let's talk about a Luxio itself so tell me about the Alexa system architecture
 yeah so where are you still out architecture and Rescue out memory Centric architecture so please play to Simply speaking logically it just a single Master architecture with a way to work a demon is running on the only I've been working out and it's it's like many other ask you out on a different states. Which focus a lot on a memory memory Centric in the meantime that's that's one major difference in the meantime we have a lot of features in our space for example like tiered storage which I mentioned earlier which means that yes we focus on the performance but we also the average other all the tears Oswald like a SSD HDD and it's been running our environment
 MacArthur monohydrate like I do in the meantime like we also do it like Mazda for tolerance to guarantee there's two to guarantee there's no single point of failure salable about architecture
 okay so Alexia has a master and it has some number of workers and each worker has access to a ram file system describe this architecture in a little more detail and give me an idea of what your responsibilities of the workers are what their relationship is to the master and so on you no problem so far the worker light stay on every working out we're on a Alaska what demon which manages a local space like local tiered structure and as far as its report a status update to the master as far as response summer remote I'll request that's a worker demon worker machine and when they when there is a totality ask your client is going to access is going to access
 is Ron desk directly to got a full memory performance that's that's the worker par and from the monster part we all are Monster Mount note email managers or keep track of all the workers status as well as far as understanding we are the days where the data is the date of location information and sometimes it's real response client request to ask for the medication information on the data data data
 how often do nodes fail in a typical cluster
 yeah so
 so that different types of Theatre so like if you say machine feeder it's what we are seeing is a similar to a halt other company I need tissue produces Midstate seeing so and we have mechanism to to recover from that for the system is off for the software itself it's like you know whether you are using a stable release or you are using a like a like a like a monster Branch Cutting Edge monster branch and the end it's like once we heard from our users people pretty happy about our software quality let's say for example like by do they have been running a senior production for more than a year and they are pretty pleasant experience which way are very happy to hear
 yeah but doesn't Ray we are concentrate we're also constantly improving the the system from every single perspectives cooling including the stability of the system
 so we'll talk more about some of the company use cases later on including by do I talk more about failures and what you do around failures alexios idea to prevent failure while. I should say similar to Sparks idea which is the lineage based recovery what is lineage based storage yes I'm on different data types A1 Concrete example would it be like say you have a program a reason a bunch of files and writes a bunch of files as well and this is a lineage information in alexio
 all by knowing that information if any day that got lost a lot you will be able to relax necessary competition jobs together daily bag but that's just a one way of how we handle this we also I also would quite different options for our users which for example like like a you can do a synchronous persistence and lineage together for Taurus or you can use like synchronous persistence by which means while writing into Alex you a lot also synchronously flash data into our anchor storage which are supplied the reliability of the data that's another way and I like her in some cases or user doesn't care the reliability of certain data so they may simply choose okay I want to do the Flash
 set up a lot because of machine feeder short who cares Australia have a regulation they couldn't save the data to the desk and they can only what would provide a pretty flexible architecture for people to choose white Emulsion to for them to choose the waist best suitable makes most sense for them so that's the way we look at it
 so that's very interesting I want to touch more on the lineage based idea because I think this this trend of lineage based operations is just an important Concept in distributed systems in spark and you see it in a Luxio I imagine we'll be seeing it for for a long time so for people who may be newer to distributed systems they may not understand you know when they're thinking about life just replicating the data versus having the lineage and recalculating and in the event of a fault you compare the simple data replication if you if you have a fault you've got the data replicated so you can restore the data in the case of the fault in a lineage based system it seems like that would be a lot more complicated you have to take all these past operations recompute the data in order to get it back
 why is the lineage base operation actually cheaper than just replicating that data I say that's a good point so what made it possible what made it possible or attractive is that in a big date of world all the data volume is really high and the replicating. A call to replicating it is much higher than recording the in the lineage information and I agree with what you said that to me to handle this information while it's not easy job it's a it's hard what where we what we are doing is that why we provide an API for the upper layer basically the fremaux players to average is functionality how to do the integration
 and though when they are also I need a competition framework integrate with us for that particular feature so that basically means that application on top of that framework will be able to Alaris this feature transparently transparent slide
 so even though the system itself could be accomplished system itself is hard but most of the capacity is handled by a Honda by the competition for developers application to buy the first we try to hide the campati from the operator as much as possible, it's also is also a a ongoing effort you can always make it better and easier for 4.4 for the operator to conceal yes
 why is it cheaper to maybe maybe I'm just a rephrase in the same why is it cheaper to do this lineage based strategy rather than just copying like replicating everything in memory like couldn't you just have 3 copies of everything and have them in memory on different nodes yeah you can you some cases but say
 assess act like you have The Spectator Victor environment like your banner pro at maybe like a hundred megabytes write in a data not program is dealing with the input output the other offer that it's going to be like hundreds of gigabytes
 and it's a thousand times different and then replicating.
 First of all you hot you will see that you were Rich the bottom lock of the network that's why it's you and the other issue is a replicating it in memory right even though memory prices going. He's financially every year but you still have limited memory space so by replicating it you will consume a lot of memory space that's ignore me call twice people can make by using oral way.. That's if she doesn't exist sure if you need to recompute from lineage rather than recomputing from a replicated type of system of how how time-intensive is it to to recompute data from the lineage of depends on the application and depends on the it's it's it's not that easy issue it's not easy
 we like to be with you will have ways to have plants on bombed on that on that top on it from that perspective but in the meantime I think Lisa miscellaneous feature we started it's it's only one part of the system like the whole system myself or if you look at a new announcement we made it now the system has progressed tremendously over the past I just give you some numbers for exam home I like it 1-1 number I just talked to miss it so now the system has a wrong to let me see around 13000 I think star on 13th
 a year ago it was a 3002 meets so over the posse are this increase in like 5 times and the community also grew very fast as well so a year ago we had maybe around 50-60 contributors and we are presently surprised by this and enter we believe that with his clothes at the community and we along with the community will add more like futurist an advantage more pieces into the system and which brings more advantages of future usage to our is so that's that's what we see and back to the linkage linkage Point that's the initial future we had and now we have so so much more like the like the one
 we can start like the tiered storage system like the one we discussed like the the unified namespace so or the different ways to access the data like he use API it has been amazing to see
 yeah and so you know I saw several talks as I Was preparing for this interview several talk to you gave in and each of these talks you talked about the overarching goal with a Luxio and it seemed like you know many people asked you this question what is the goal of Alexia formerly tachyon and at first glance maybe the goal you know you might think other goal is just like this in memory computer thing but it's actually a little more abstract so talk about the goals of a Luxio
 yes stop in today so I think the system the number one goal is to bring more benefit to the ecosystem so the way we do this is us I mentioned earlier before before spiritual Ayers why is the computation the other wines a persistent storage and there are issues with this especially along with a growing outside you have more different types of our systems you have more different heart condition framers and evening time sometime Amanda cases is the issue and bring this new layer which which abstract Beast understory systems and provide a unified namespace to the operator to make make them to make it a competition to make the operator competition Frame Works as well as applications
 easier to access data from any storage systems so that's that's the benefit performance and an hour-long vision is just to make this like a Comdata facto standard of this unified did access layer it access layer and in the meantime Kauai Hawaii tremendous performance Improvement to our users that's all well and that we just got to the whole ecosystem to the to the frame to the Frameworks different Frameworks to difference or systems in the morning points and I Collide to our users that's the way we see this
 so let's talk about some of those benefits in practice is it for example you know or Luxio obviously speeds things up and that propagates to the people working at the higher end of the Big Data stack we have data engineers and data scientist is the job of a data scientist or a data engineer perhaps working with spark or some other set of tools how does their job and their workflow change in a big data stack that is postal Luxio that's a great quick question so I think they are a lot different than a lot of perspective but there are some major ones for example like from the status on his perspective
 black on one side Alexia makes their life much easier
 zombie costumes to unify namespace they don't need to explain Station Move data anymore so they just simply tell a Roxio I want to access this data and then it will just be able to access it that's one went one thing you don't need to wait for 2 months or a month to get people to transfer data father that's one side and the other side 4 on other up the performance me my father you saw like him like the Barclay wrote an article like maybe 2 weeks ago Publix store on diesel so they start making the impossible possible with Pacquiao back then was due to weather seal
 Soul Asylum rating spark applications from all words hours to seconds that's tremendous so basically you can think of like previously had a miniature like half the day or two to get is prepared now if it's became seconds list reminders by changed their working Behavior to make it much more efficient and bringing them competitive advantage in their space
 that's it that's it you sure why one thing is making a lot make their life much easier and improve the performance tremendously and I think this uniform supplier based on like my One Life to see call divider you install a car is also the physical creator of a spark as well
 so he said it's also an hour price at least he said the alarm CO2 storage it's more like a knowledge to be Internet Protocol liar IP layer 2 to internet and we can enable Foster Innovation and make people's life much easier so that's that's the way we see it go from taking an hour to run a spark job move seconds kind of traditionally look at least when I was in school five five six years ago we always talked about things in terms of Moore's Law and having this a very predictable you know 18 months cycle of compute time you know number of processors on disc doubling or whatever
 what
 I feel like perhaps that set of Trends was constructed by what occurred on the hardware layer because you had to have all these people moving in lockstep in order to orchestrate the hardware progressions but when you make an advanced at the software layer it seems like perhaps you need less coordination and therefore you can get bigger step changes such as what we're seeing with a Luxio deep does that does that idea resonate with you or do you think that's crazy
 I need a hot work fine there is always a I mean so it won't look at the whole industry so it's improving from many different perspectives the hot water is always you always have loved a lot of innovation in Hardware's on a hardware side but in the meantime the software also adopt them self so like two example like we saw the transitive adira so we love to try and will provide much better software and the Innovative architecture to Industry and what we are seeing it that way we just a cloud weight with the whole ecosystem to bring more benefit to our users so that's that's the way with you yeah
 with a Luxio in a you mentioned there's there is still cases where you do want a store to disc let's talk about that and little little more detail so when would you still want to you know I'm I'm at they decide to 78 engineer I'm a win-win am I still going to want to use disk storage despite a Luxio
 yeah so if you still want to use it by say you have a lot of day that you want to put on desk in the ass for you sound like that's all on the storage it's playing Alexia world and I lost you always works with a little while more on the storage systems in most cases so anyway you didn't want to work with that it's a space storage systems wow and and the goal is not to replace the goal is to work with with work with them and to improve the house. That's all that's the way we see it yeah
 so what is the future of the Hadoop ecosystem and how does a Luxio fit in
 that's alright that's a great question so hard you'll be closest to me. It's a very big ecosystem and and a lot of years in this ecosystem so how we are sticking together when I lost you we can breathing first of all of course we came for the performance on the other side will make people's life much easier as well as breeding the the traditional world with this with this ecosystem but in the meantime I'll from our perspective Alex you also works with a with a lot more different types of ecosystem as well that's that's what we see it and come back to the ecosystem we will keep improving and end up further to make our users experience better by improve performance and make an improved are you the bility
 of the system and where can people find out more about a Luxio and find out more about you oh yeah it's all products Ice Company website web a lot more information they are in the meantime if you are interested of course feel free to contact us as well will be happy to help whenever it's okay great will Hy thanks for coming on soccer and Jen radio it was great talking to you about a Luxio and I wish you the best of luck I'm really happy with your project my pleasure thank you very much Dad

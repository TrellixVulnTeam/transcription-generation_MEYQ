Transcription: Jenis levenhagen Sealy is the founder of chick Tech a non-profit keeping women in tech software engineering daily chicktech so chicktech as you said our mission is basically to get in keep Grill some women in high tech wear a 501 c 3 where National non-profit web based here in Portland Oregon and we have 6 different chapters almost 8 throughout the country we focus on high school girls fighting girls who are navigation technology Abu have the apps to do well in them and convincing them the technology and creating it is awesome and we do a career level program around more of the other side of recruiting women into technology and keeping them there once they're there we run an awesome a conference call. W
advancing the careers of technical women did you start chicktech so I started Tic Tac to provide women and girls the support that I didn't have when I was in technology and to increase their confidence than they do belong technology because I felt like I was an outsider and I felt like I wasn't good enough when in reality I believe the tech industry would have been much better with me and others like me who chose to leave one is so I never felt like I was as good as everyone else so basically the feeling that no matter how good you actually are no matter how many accolades you get you feel like you're just fooling everyone else so everybody else look see you and they're like well that person's really awesome in your life wow I got away with it again and so usually it's pretty high
performers that have this it's really just a difference between how you feel and reality in the Tech Community is imposter syndrome so rampant in the tech world I think it exists for men and women by the way yeah yeah definitely I think they say in like 70% of people in general will deal with imposter syndrome with a big reason is because our stereotype of who works in technology is really really strong we have a very when we think of a technical person we see very clearly exactly who that is in our head right and if you don't fit that stereotype that's working against you I'm in an other areas it may not be quite so
or we started breaking it down but I think I think that in Tech we're still just starting to work on the stereotypes did it take awhile for that to happen if you could give me some more about your background and Outsider feeling evolved so I graduated high school in 2001 and I had never created anything in technology before I got all the awards in math in my school but nobody had really strongly push me towards technology or engineering and I I remember when I first started my programming class after I graduated summer class at OSU and I remember not even having the context to understand what programming was or what I'd be used for like I didn't understand that people had to create something in order for the internet to be there you know what I mean nobody taught me that and when you start out that far behind in terms of Concepts
it on the night when I chose Computer Engineering I I didn't even know enough to know that women didn't usually choose computer and sharing his computer engineering is a cross between an electrical engineering and computer science so it's hard and software and women just hardly ever go into the hardware so I go in and there's all these people who is a lot of like people who go into Tech and think they know a lot and I really really cocky even though they don't really know much more than you but I didn't know that they didn't know a lot more than me I thought they were like new everything and I knew I knew nothing and so I just consistently felt like everyone else wasn't struggling or everyone else knew all of all these things that I didn't know and it wasn't until my junior or senior year but if he actually took me aside and he's like you know all these guys that act like they know all these answers and are willing to like totally raise their hand and ask questions and answer questions in class
they're getting C's and you're getting an A and that like blew my mind I had no idea I mean I knew I was getting an A but I still didn't feel confident the material and to me that meant that I wasn't as good interaction with the teacher change your internal perception of yourself it started the problem was was that so I actually took five years ago because I studied abroad for a year in the mail and so that was you know I'd already been in classes for 4 years you know three of them and technology and it had really been pounded into me that I was different and I was more outgoing and so people would act like I was a nuisance when I try to talk with them about anything other than like the current assignment or whatever you know it's not necessarily everybody right I mean there are some differences in personalities that are okay it's just like even in at work you know I really like feeding relationships and
I felt like an outsider or I felt like a nuisance when I did my internships because I just I need that people connection and they did not programmer is extremely toxic accurate most successful programmers actually seem to have a little more of a social Flair to them then maybe is the average yeah definitely I think that there's I mean there's so many personalities that I think are really great in technology and that's why I'm excited about working to break down that stereotype especially for high school girls how did your background lead to you starting an organization stretch between from when you were in college to your early career
I kind of half-heartedly applied for some jobs and my significant other and I had decided to have a child and when I was interviewing I was pregnant and I was discriminated against by two fairly prominent technology companies are based on my pregnancy and that was kind of the last straw you know I mean I'd already had issues with sexual harassment and discrimination in the tech industry and just the fact that I
was interviewed by two women one of each of these companies and one very blatantly told me that my maternity leave would be inconvenient for her team and so she was hiring someone else I just decided it wasn't worth it and so I ended up deciding to get my MBA and focus on sustainability instead and so I ended up doing my MBA I worked for 9 months for the worst company ever and feel free to like picture those words capitalized because I think I've worked for five of those companies someday I hope to this is like one of my little secondary plant I'd like to make them Aflac and send it to them because we were so terrible why so after that and that's kind of when I realized how rampant sexual harassment discrimination retaliation are in companies still
I ended up deciding to work for myself for a little bit because that seems safer and less angering and I did some business Consulting for a while I'm not not too long and then I ended up volunteering for another program here in Portland around getting a kids into Tech and I came out of that program with a lot of ideas on how to make it even better experience and as I started talking about my ideas with other people because this is our already been I'm always I've always been really passionate about sticking out for other people and especially if I've dealt with something shity helping to make sure that other people don't have to deal with that is just something I'm really passionate about and so disliked sparked that again it reminded me of the experience that I had had and the fact that I could make a difference so I took those ideas after talking with a bunch of
oh and I aren't there more women in Tech I think that there are so many reasons for that part of it as the somewhat toxic and stereotypes environment I think that women have traditionally been taught to use technology and not create it I think that girls look at it and see if they have so much pressure to conform and focus on their looks and Heather perceived in terms of how boys will like them that they are they aren't encouraged enough to work on something like technology that is perceived as to be a harder career than some others right and so they have lower self-confidence we've seen studies that show how much like the huge drop in confidence that girls get as a teenagers that much higher than the drops
boys are seeing and I think there was out that encouragement and without really positive figures in their lives they just don't believe they can do it or they're told they just don't have the brains for it you know like their brain doesn't work the right way may be there to social or whatever I mean I had somebody I had a woman and Technology here tell me that she didn't believe that women belong in technology because all most women care about is fashion and men and that was crazy also you can care about technology and care about fashion and love interest however you want to look at it right do you know any statistics off hand that best describe how few women are in Tech. Like 25% but I know so for example one of the one of the universities that we work with year ago they're entering ECS class electrical engineering and computer
was 8% girls which was 30 and they usually lose half of their girls by the only have graduate and so that's like 15 girls will be graduating from this pretty big engineering school women in Tech I think there's a couple ones that stand out I mean what is and whenever I talk to people they talk about the difference that just a couple women on a team make in the dynamic there a lot of consequences I think around collaboration I may be shown that a team that has more women is more collaborative and when you when you work together you can get more things done better if shown that the number of women on a team core lights directly to how productive that team is not stopping at 50% women but it's all around
collaborative that team is how I'm pathetic that team is and how included each person is and if shown that women tend towards those characteristics more than men's us not necessarily that women are better than men is that the traits that women often bring more on average lead to a better team environment so I think that companies are missing out on that other also missing out on different personalities different life experiences they're missing out on some really creative ideas and when we do our workshops for high school girls they are so amazing and creative and it is really a shame if they don't go into technology and they don't bring that amazing creativity in the ability to pull all these really desperate facts together or disparate ideas together to create something new and if you have no this I guess is that may want to allow people talk about is if you have your work for us not the sin of the same demographic
as your audience than your audience isn't going to identify with your product as much and your staff for your employees are going to create products that aren't solving your audiences needs as much so I remember growing up with some whisperings of this idea that women are Predator naturally less inclined towards mathematical or quantitative or scientific subjects do you think that there is still this perception in our world or believe that there's an element of truth to it I don't think there's a future but I think that we still have these perceptions I don't know if you've ever checked out like the unconscious bias or the implicit bias test that Harvard has I think it's called like the implicit bias project or something like that so you can actually take a test that measures your your implicit bias or unconscious bias with different things and one of
what is a generous and Science and it definitely shows that a vast majority of our population is biased towards thinking that men are better at science and math then women are there some way that we could know that there would be some preternatural tendency for women to be less good at these quantitative subject because the only way that our culture has has has evolved is one that subject sure if we have a be tested it there's no way to tell if if this Narrative of women being worshipped this is the the the dearth of women in quantitative Fields right yeah yeah yeah I think that we I mean so when I get when I talk about our high school program or our program I talked about how important the sensible
if you look at our society and you look at how how important that sense of belonging as you can look at games you can look at bullying you can look at good things like volunteering I mean people will give I mean chick Tac has well over $400 in tears right now throughout the country and it's because they want to belong to something and if you have this your you have this by us I mean because it's not just mad I mean women have the same by us you have the bias in the assumption that that's somewhere that you're not going to feel like you belong your kind of avoiding you may not know you're avoiding it or you may but you're not going to go because we have people will kill to get that sense of belonging literally kill to get it how powerful is it when we can actually wrote that in for use it for good right environment
hostile towards talk some about how this is changing and the part that chick Tech is playing what goes on at chick Tech events for example of chicken High School right it's our kind of signature program it's what we started out with so high school is a yearlong series of events for a hundred high school girls in each study so we bring them in we are we use a nomination process to work with schools to get girls who will not nominate themselves or opt into our programs otherwise we look for a minimum of 30 33% girls who are eligible for free or reduced lunch teachers nominate them because no matter how old you are it always feels good to be nominated by someone above you write for something special especially something hard with quotation marks like like programming or engineering
so we get we got a ton of names from different schools here in Portland we work with pink 20 to 25 different schools to get a bunch of girls nominated and then girls register they then go to our kickoff event in Portland it's November 7th and 8th and the others throughout the country are between Dan and the 21st and 22nd of November. I'll go to the street today event they'll go get to go through 107 workshops so they actually get to create a project so it's not jumping from Project to project it's one project 5 hours each day and then at the end they get to actually show off their project we create I like a science fair but no competition because competition in this case is just silly we invite the community and everybody has their little booze and people come around and they check out the projects and they're always really impressed so the girls kind of have a win right
we show a really strong increase in their sense of belonging to a technology Community their interest in a technology career and their confidence in their technology skills after the kickoff event we do monthly workshops for the year and then we also do a one-on-one mentoring program with men and women in the technology industry and we're also always looking for companies to host an intern in the summer as part of its the demographic right we're not looking for the best for not trying to weed out the crappy people and only celebrate the best right we're celebrating the fact that women can create technology and we find girls who feel like they're not good enough right when they are and how silly would it be to then be like oh yeah you were good enough
actually you're not actually got enough you know this person is better than you there's just no no reason for it and it's it would be counter-productive and harmful to our cause can I see other other programs that do that actually I'm actually called them sometimes and like strongly urge them to come up with a different way to celebrate learning an accomplishment than cutting them against each other especially when we're trying to create a community write a community is based on collaboration and connecting with each other not refusing to help somebody because then their project might be better than yours reverse Lee inclined towards competition speakers to corporate narrative competition
increasing of collaboration giant corporations competing with Google competing with Google as much as I like doing things that are mutually exclusive is is kind of weird what kinds of success stories are you seeing how are these young girls changing in personality as they go through chicktech high school yeah so we have seen a girls who are opting into AP Computer Science and I would like the robotics program we actually had one teacher so we had been doing our program in early spring or late winter in Portland and then we decide to synchronize all 6 chapter so they're kicking off in November and I actually had a teacher get mad at me and he's like but where
going to get the girls for this year in my robotics program if you're not starting until November because this was the only way that he was getting girls to opt-in there's one school out in Hillsboro that we work really closely that they've been really really great partner with us Glencoe high school and the principal told me that they had this technology hallway and girls just never went down it and he realized that after these girls were starting to go through chick-chack that like all the sudden girls felt comfortable going down that hallway projects to school with them because they were so proud of what they created a we had a girl come back or we have a couple girls from that school come back and volunteer with us to help Inspire other girls to do Technologies they got to pass on their stuff it's actually
as ironic as it says it's almost a competition at that school to get into check in to check tech now and yeah we've had we tried girl tube said you know a chick Tech showed me that I can stand up to the sexism in my high school engineering class we've had girls who go on to OSU a computer science or engineering or PSU yeah so we've had we had a lot of success stories and we're actually working hopefully get some more concrete numbers but we've shown at our last PSU or are Portland event at PSU we went from 14% of our girls saying they were very interested in technology career to 46% just after the kickoff weekend we should a hundred and 18% increase in their confidence
yeah I mean we are definitely changing their perception of whether they can do technology and even if they choose to not go into technology because so many of those the girls are so great you know they have many other options right so they're not all going to choose technology and that's okay because even if they end up going in and like doing a business degree but they are more comfortable playing around with technology because they had this success where they were able to do something with technology and it wasn't scary and nothing burst into flames right maybe they'll start being able to take her a little bit and be known as like the techy person in the office and that will make them more valuable and they'll be more confident in themselves and try more new things you know so we really feel like there is a cumulative effect of our programs but we're not I mean one of the things you know I look at chick Tech versus other programs many other programs are
fighting the same girls who are opting into other programs we definitely have those and we love them they're awesome but most programs can't find the girls who aren't doing this yet and sometimes when I talk to thunderstorm like yeah but why aren't all of your girls coming back and staying the whole year I'm like well they don't know they don't have any idea what it's like to create technology maybe they don't like it you know and that's okay you know the fact that they tried it and they were able to choose for themselves rather than somebody else looking at a stereotype telling them that they don't fit in it and then denying them access by not giving them the opportunities the girls choosing themselves as way better even if they choose know these girls enter into chicktech
what attack career looks like high school or a lawyer look like software engineer did yeah yeah they almost none of them do I gave him the girls who are kind of already engaged in technology cuz we have about 70% of our girls who aren't getting Asian with 30% of may be done programming class before whatever because we ask some of that on the pre survey what you know what do you think a computer engineer a computer programmer does and they say things like oh they build computers or they they fix computers when they're broken Nations I think it just stems from what you know if their parents aren't in technology pretty much the only place that they're going to get that knowledge unless they do you know actually go on Google research it
is through school right they spent a lot of time in school they spend a lot of time doing homework for school is my son is now in high school and I'm hearing a lot of complaining I mean that's that's where they're going to learn not taught there then they choose things like nursing or dental assistant and we had one girl who and I was she sometimes I play chauffeur when I'm not being executive director and so I was driving a couple girls to the max stop so they could get home because we provide transportation so our girls can get get to her classes and yeah she said like she was like really quiet and really sweet and she was like you know I just I really wanted to thank you for running chick Tac because before I started chicktech I thought my only choice was to be a dental assistant now that I did check tach I feel you I realize that I need to be a programmer and she actually I believe she started last year at PCC and programming classes
yeah it's just that it was just a she was part of a family that didn't have necessarily a lot of resources and she she was just trying to pick the best career she thought she could do but in reality she was really awesome and smart and should be doing something really fun and cool like programming because that's what makes her happy hopefully pop culture is changing what it means to be a programmer in the existence of programmers fastest growing and we started running programs two and a half years ago we started with Portland and then the same here we went to Corvallis and then the next year 2014 we moved to the Bay Area and then we doubled again this year to six chapters each chapter takes about a hundred 250 volunteers to run a year which is how we get so many mileage
so we have 6 chapters right now we also have so those are in the Bay Area Corvallis to Portland Seattle Chicago New York we also have people working to start chapters in Boston and Austin because we like a rhyming and we're also looking for other cities to actually expand to in 2016 we actually only have I'm a partially paid employee but other than that it's all volunteer so far do the goals of chicktech change as you expanded
the goals have stayed the same because I've always been getting keep girls women high-tech how we do those have continue to expand so for example were looking at we want to start doing culture Consulting so particularly around and conscious by us and particularly specially around increasing diversity in your Workforce by creating a great environment that everyone loves right and so consultancy in and say hey we realize we need cultural change that's a good question so this is a new Initiative for us if we just started thinking about what it will look like and we was specially been looking at how can we help influence Tech startups who don't have a firm culture and place yet but who will be much more successful if they have a good one but I don't
oh yeah I mean I've seen there's been a lot of demand for unconscious bias training and helping recruiters to be less biased and be more welcoming to diverse candidates so it'll be interesting I'm interested to talk to some of our good partners and see what they need and how we can help them fill that Gap in particular what we're looking at doing is we're looking at finding consultants and training them in the different cities that were in and then helping them you know how the companies that are there more complex to manage as it's scaled for you I believe about three-quarters about half my time is now actually like doing business stuff which is kind of sad but like someone else to do that now so that I can just meet with people and grow the program instead of like filling out tax forms QuickBooks and other Terrible Terror
things making sure every state I'd like someone else to do that now so yeah it's definitely definitely been more complex for trying to build two were trying to build more of a non-hierarchical model with it so we have and we have leaders we have leadership teams in each in each chapter but we're trying to build a sustainable volunteer-run almost completely volunteer-run organization and so we look at our leaders more as enabling the people below them to have the resources that they need and then I'll let that they need and so we're really in a we have a monthly chapter lead call where all the chapter Leeds get on and they usually spend it like talking about their frustrations and getting advice from other chapters I really want to Foster that environment where it's not that we need a bunch of paid staff to manage chapters staff is there to facilitate relationships and the chapters
start each other and grow organically together and I think that will be much much more powerful and creative we tell people you're creating a chick movement right and the movement needs to come from like a Groundswell of people right I can't just be one person up here telling everyone else what to do also that's exhausting and I don't know why anybody would want to do that so you must educating people about technology seems that I've been discussing the people this week is this for coding bootcamps are superior to college and how College teaches technology I think that they are very different I don't know that you can necessarily compare them at least in my mind so there's a couple things that I like about college one is not the debt that I am now paying I like that you learn a broad range
Mustangs and you're not just learning one thing that will be useful for a particular type of company you're learning the structure of all the different things that you could know and understanding how they fit together and I like that about colleges I think that they could be probably better taught and they could be more project-based and maybe sometimes a little less theoretical because people aren't coming out with the confidence that they need to really do well in jobs but the thing that I worry about with skulls and boot camps is that they are usually pretty specific however I've never been to I've never been to it obviously a coding class at a attic old school so they could be they could be amazing
what do you think of the term brogrammer
 mildly hilarious everytime I say it it's right it's right there has been like an outcry from from some understand where I'm at so what so what have you heard like what is your perception of it there are certain cultures that take the word brogrammer and then adopted into their culture with such strength that the programming environment turns into a fraternity you know said some people but alienates diverse people you know what I mean and so in that it's bad I almost wonder because when I hear programmer I think of people
 we are definitely like frat style people but also like people who are more outgoing and have more people skills so I'm wondering if there's just been a move towards people with more people skills and that's kinda how that got started and there are definitely people who fight like a frat boy type idea yeah I don't know I don't really know that I have a huge negative or positive feelings towards though what about the term programmer I don't know what is it shaylyn grammar is like I think it epitomizes the idea that when you bring up the idea of women in Tech if you're disgusted with a woman who is intac it's kind of the wrong way to approach the subject to even come at it from that angle because
 from is let's talk about technology what is your success what are the things that make you excited about the issue of women in Tech it gives women the impression that the only thing you want to talk to them about is is women in Tech like the controversy and what not so so well grammar it is sort of a commentary on maybe like the media's perception of things like the only time you're going to contact if you're if you're a media article about journalism is if you're talking about women in Tech so that that's that's what is a commentary on it doesn't apply to me because that is what they should be contacting me about but I can have I have heard other women be pretty frustrated about that experience
 to that of women in finance or law I think that they're pretty similar I mean I've talked to I've talked to women lawyers who had similar experiences
 I don't necessarily I haven't talked a lot of women in finance before so I don't really know what their experiences are like but I would assume it's pretty similar and one of the things you know people say oh how much are you going to change the technology industry in 5 years I'm like
 the problem is is we're fighting against an age-old problem right it's not just we need to like tell some more girls to go into Tech and then they'll do that and then the problem will be fixed right we're fighting against a very strong Tech culture but we're also fighting against since the dawn of time women have been considered less than equal to men right it's it's women have been slaves women have been property women have been there solely for sex and procreation only in very very small communities and kind of random places have women been treated equal to men and until we get rid of that issue as a society we can't fully change one industry or another and it's not just it's not just Tech right this is a society wide issue of women's equality interesting
 is that companies often hire in a way that is disadvantages to women when they look for quote culture fit what is wrong with the idea of looking for culture fit and how should companies change their hiring practices around that that's a good question so one of the things this is sort of a side thing that you reminded me of it one of the things I've read is that matter hired for their potential and women are hired for their current skills so that's not necessarily wrong culture fair but it's definitely something that companies need to keep in mind is that women have potential to write and if you don't give them the opportunity to give get the skills that you're letting men get then they'll never reach the top of your company and I'll never be able to reach their potential in terms of culture fit I mean definitely it's it's a big danger because you know it is easier to work with people who are like you you know what even in chick Tac
 starting to work on how can we be more diverse because we want to be as inclusive as we want tech companies to be right and it definitely is going to take a conscious effort on our part especially here in Portland when where it is a little bit harder to to be diverse because we're also very white especially in the middle of which I know it's a struggle and I I know that for me when I you know when I meet with somebody it's definitely easier to feel an affinity to words somebody at first glance and they talk like you when they act like you and I think that it's that's understandable to an extent right it's under it's understandable how that happens but it's not okay to just stop there and say oh good I mesh well with this person oh yeah and now we're all white men and that's okay because we all get along well because then you're missing out on all of these
 good ideas right and so I've had some really interesting people who and I'm lucky because since I work with volunteers when I meet somebody I don't have to worry about if I hire this person I have to keep keep him around for a year and they're paying them a full time salary and therefore I can't hire anybody else so I'm lucky because I can try people out you know and if they're not working we just mutually decided that you know maybe they want to volunteer somewhere else right or I send them to a different department or chapter and chick Tack and maybe you'll match really well with this person right but the people American people that I have not felt an affinity for or because they weren't like me but I gave them a project or I put them on a team and they were no after a month or so they were some of my best performers right and that's what companies are missing out on when they hire only for culture fit you and obviously we look for certain types of culture
 like we look for you know you need to believe in women's equality you need to you need to be collaborative and you need to believe that all people should be treated equally but that doesn't that's not based on the color of your skin or your gender or your life any of your lifestyle choices right are there any other events or Partnerships perhaps on the corporate level with regard to chicktech beyond the high school level if there's somebody in a company listening and they want to get involved in chick Tac or sponsor an event some how do you have the key to explain you like yeah so one of our big ones is activyl you so act W is stands for advancing the cause of technical women it's a one or two-day conference depending on the city you're in it has a talent fair at has work
 jobs Technical and career based speakers all the things so I'm Portland here it's in April in Seattle it'll be late September the Bay Area Chicago and New York not yet scheduled wear when there's will be um it's basically it's like a local grasshopper so people can find companies that are looking for them in their area so they don't have to move somewhere weird like Florida and they also get to build their local support network so that when they meet somebody but they want to know they can you know have coffee with them the next week where is Grace Hopper is a really awesome conference but you only get to see those people once a year right and so we won't really want to build up the support network for women where they're at so those are annual local conferences the one here in Portland had 300 people buy tickets the one in C
 like 400 that's been a really strong conference we had 92% of the people who attended the last April say they want to attend this next year there's also chicken curry which is often focused around reading a meet up so here in Portland shalin is running the crew album beat up she did a 3D printing class we were able to only charge $50 for it and we provided dinner all three evenings they got to print things they got to learn how to do 3D modeling from nothing from note from no experience we had an awesome sponsor for that Uncorked Studios studios they have they hosted us and give us some money for food which allowed us to only charge $50
 she's doing some other really great events around like the legal side of doing a startup New York Chapter and Seattle chapters are also doing monthly or every other month. Career events to so if companies are in either of those cities they should also get involved were always looking for host really looking for people to run workshops we still try to keep it we try to keep panels to a minimum because they're boring and I really try to make it interactive and discussion-based so that people are actually able to contribute and not just sitting there staring at somebody blankly yeah I was just been really great
 call Janice levenhagen CX4 coming onto software engineering daily and talking about chicktech it's been great thank you

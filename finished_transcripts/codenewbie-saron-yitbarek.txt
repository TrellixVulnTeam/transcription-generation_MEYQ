 there are hundreds of tools for looking at user data Google analytics optimizely mixpanel customer. I owe all of these tools can be useful for figuring out how users are engaged with a product unfortunately many of these tools require you to write domain specific code in order to gather the data and set up your Integrations what if I told you that there is a product for reading code only wants a single API a tool for unifying your data and Performing analytics on any platform for Marketo to MailChimp segment is that product segment simplifies your analytics so that you can collect customer data with one API and send it to any of hundreds of tools for analytics marketing and data warehousing with segment a developer can satisfy all the stakeholders at once from the data driven account manager to the app happy marketer to the data science
 who needs a data warehouse with a clean schema thanks to segment your CEO will fall in love with your newly efficient Integrations with tools like zendesk intercom and appnexus I'm falling in love with segment just talking about it thanks to segment for sponsoring software engineering daily if you are listening to software engineering daily and you have not tried segment give it a shot at segment.com and tweet at segments to let them know you heard about the product on software engineering daily we wouldn't be doing this show without the sponsors so thanks again two segments for sponsoring this show now let's get on with this episode
 saranya Barrick is the host of the code newbie podcast a show about programming and learning to code sarant welcome to software engineering daily to become a software engineer where I was working for a bunch of different startups and I were doing everything that was not technically so I've done some business development and sales and marketing a bunch of random things and but I really wanted to do was impact of product and I really wanted to affect the product that we worked on and I couldn't because I wasn't tactical that idea how to code and I felt like I just kept hitting this wall for a number of years but I couldn't be the other person I wanted to be until finally out of frustration at my last job I said screw this I'm going to learn to code I quit my job and that was the beginning of the journey
 what were your first steps to learning how to code once you have decided that you wanted to be a programmer so when I first learned the code I'm actually think I had a much easier time then then I would if I try to learn to code now because the resources were just nervous so much so many less resources back then which made it a little bit easier but one of the things I did was figure out what it was I wanted to learn I didn't know what language was I didn't know where framework was I didn't really know enough about the structure or the building blocks or you know what that was even made of to be able to say okay I'm going to do that so I spent a couple weeks maybe doing just a lot of research reading a lot of Korra posts you know asking the question I want to learn to code where do I start over and over and over again as I finally made a decision so just that was stuck on Step 2 was figuring out okay I wanted to learn Ruby if I want to learn Ruby then who do I learn from what steps do I take and how do I know when I'm done learning
 also a pretty hard question to answer but that was the second thing that I did so a lot about the difficulties of learning to code the barriers to learning to code and how to succeed in that environment so juxtaposing that knowledge that you've learned through the code newbie podcast with your own personal experience learning to code what are the biggest barriers to people learning to code
 sure there's a lot of them I think one of the biggest ones is figuring out what to learn how to learn it and when to know when you're done one of the biggest Trends I seen our community is people Cowboy Nobel charge her for a little bit and then we'll go on the python then you know what did my downloaded little bit of Jenga there's just like no focus in on one thing and I've heard so many stories of people saying I tried a bunch of things for the last 4 months and I'm not that much better off I'm not that much closer to getting a job you know that I was 4 months ago and that dabbling issue has been absolutely huge I was really lucky I'm not a dabbler I'm not the type of person I like to pick a thing and dive deep and really focus on it I think that ended up serving me well but the Dowling is a huge huge one II really because she was just the money you know a lot of bootcamp cost you a good amount of money to cost thousands of dollars and now I think there are more payment plans and there were a couple years ago there is no loans
 there is no pay at the end of the program when you get a job with those different ways that they're trying to make it more affordable but just the price tag of a solid foundation in code compared to know what it's like when you're self-taught but that Financial aspect is also a big issue in our community
 how did you come upon the idea to start the code newbie podcast Twitter chat for almost a year and the Twitter chat is awesome it's Wednesday night is 1 hour or 9 p.m. eastern time and we just tweet different questions each week trying to really get people or talk to each other is just an excuse to connect people and it was great because it's exceeded enough people meet all the time during that one hour and build relationships that they know wouldn't have had without the chat but what didn't happen is we didn't get a chance to dive deep right we couldn't like really get into someone's story we can really get into someone's journey and I thought I'd be a really important aspect really important thing for the community to have and I know that a lot of other Twitter chat will use the Twitter chat format as an interview for matter though have a guest on and those questions would honestly I'm not a big fan of I don't feel like Twitter is a really good format for interviewing it's so I thought
 voice inflection what is an interview with a voice inflection and so I thought OK Google what's a better meteorite is it blog post that video is a podcast and before now all the tech stuff I used to work at NPR I wanted to be a journalist and thought I thought audio audio through really good format a podcast
 I'm super curious about the NPR stuff and I'll certainly ask you about that later on but
 tell me about the code newbie Community cuz you obviously been fostering this vibrant amazing Community what what is the constitution of this community like give me some kind of sense of the demographic and that the give me the story of the prototypical code newbie person so our community is international actually want to speak I will be calling Australia last week and while I was there I took an Uber and Uber driver was telling me about how he teaches Python and my husband is in the car with me but yeah you know if you heard of this thing called me or trying to get more people know about it he's like oh do the only thing is awesome it was great it was great I already heard about it when I mention it and they were really excited about podcast and telling me stories and so that was huge I had no idea we had people in Australia who already knew about it so
 so we're definitely International we are mostly clear changes were a little bit older where people who found out about the whole coding thing a little bit later in life most of us have some professional experience before getting into it with a good number of families and parents that we had a couple Twitter chat dedicated to you really are into things you know how do you get your kids into code if you want to do that you know how do you find support within your family as you start this new thing I'm so we have a good number family when we also have a good percentage of people who are more seen your developers who are part of the community just to help out and those people are amazing and they're so helpful and we even pretty Vibrance Lots near did they were almost at 3,000 members and we have people on there all the time who just you don't wait for help call and they're right there given answers and debugging with the community
 yeah that's very interesting that the psychological barriers like I like that you touched on that idea that you sometimes have to convince your family that this is a worthwhile Pursuit I remember having to do this in college literally every semester so I'm really enjoying this computer science stuff and one of my parents would be like if so are you sure you can get a job with this and be like like you know how you're on your computer all the time like I'm learning to like do that stuff like make that stuff you sure you can get a job anyway I think it's interesting that there are a lot of people who are learn-to-code quote-unquote late in the game and you know I I learned I think around 20 I was H20 I start start learning and I honestly had the the fear of missing
 everybody who starts later than like 12 years old has to like oh my gosh why have I why did I have to wait this long and how how will I ever catch up to all the people that started when they were 12 years old what are the advantages to starting to learn to code later than the average person or later than the prototypical like 12 year old Natural Born programmer that is such a good question I might need there was two advantages one being able to appreciate it you know at that level eight the our community is so excited so so passionate because this world is incredibly needed and they just you know for most of their lives they have few technology as just consumer's right they're the ones who received the product and play with it and his idea that they could open up the your magic box and play around and create is just an incredibly new phenomenon and so we talked about you know getting employed and getting a job or people are super passionate and super excited they'll stay late
 this is totally new and exciting to them so I think that's a huge advantage to starting a little bit later and the second one is that because a lot of our community came from different professions they have a bunch of other cell therapy incredibly social they're very good teachers they love the community they in a lot of them come from more customer service type rolls whether that means sales or waiting tables or whatever that is so they get the empathy part right there we always talk about at a community how we need to be more apathetic mean to be able to relate to the user and the other is a customer service component to being a good software developer and so they have that already they have those skills they can speak to it and so there's advantages and both experience and also just in the newness of coating is a huge thing for them
 show these people that are making some kind of career change into coding how did they typically work coding into their career transition today do they continue on with their present job and learn to code at the same time or do they quit their job and then just go full-force into coding or what typically happens where people decide okay I need to make a career transition people do it however way they need to one of my early guess Brian Douglas he's not episode to the community podcast he was working full-time we could just had a kid around the time where he decided he wanted to learn to code and so when he got home he would code from like 8 to midnight and he wake up at 4 a.m. and go from 4 a.m. till I got to work during lunch time at work he would have these online study group so we can learn to code so he's every single hour that he possibly could given that he had a full-time job and given that he
 family to take care of so we heard a lot of stories of people like that to squeezing in any hours they can a good number of people with the support there for your family and. Taking a little bit of time off and saying you know I'm going to take a couple months which is you know what I end up doing Temple Run 2 code and hopefully at the end of this short. I'll be able to get a job and that takes a lot of you know Financial stability it takes family and put a family support but I'd say most people are working at least part-time while also learning to code and hoping slowly over time to get enough skills and get enough experience to finally make that leak
 in terms of your own career transitions you started off pursuing medicine and I had a stint of pursuing the pre-med field myself what I think I heard you say an in an interview the Scott Hanselman interview where you said you know that you had an experience where you just realized you didn't really want to spend your life like
 then why don't you just explain to me switch from from pursuing medicine to other Pursuits so when I was pretty mad I was an angel basically my senior year I can I finish the whole track I was in the process of studying for the MCAT and for me what it is that I finally Shadow the doctor I shattered a cardiologist he is a cardiac surgeon and I scrubbed and it was really awesome I got to see them like 6 a pacemaker like cut this guy's chest open and you know is it was incredible to watch but what I learned about that experience is that I was interested in the science I was interested in the house things worked part of medicine I loved organic chemistry and biochemistry and Physiology and those Topics in pain figuring out what's the problem with the solution how did this end up being this way and the aspect of medicine which is the most important one just saving people's lives
 wasn't quite as interesting and I learned that after shattering the doctor for a couple times and so I thought okay if I don't want to say people's lies I probably shouldn't be a doctor what else do I do how old is the practice of medicine compared to that of software engineering
 well I haven't been a doctor yet so I can say though that my experience being pre-med and just you know how incredibly incredibly hard I had to work while I was eating up for you mad have definitely helped prepare me to learn to code a lot of is so right now I run on a program at Microsoft Alta child's Academy and it's a form of Technical Training Program teaching people and demand technical skills it's not programming it's more Cloud Server Administration i t type of stuff but one of the big things that I see with our current cohort is the ability to study and kind of buckle down and focus and find the right process is to absorb a lot of very strange for an intimidating information in a very short amount of time and so when I was pretty bad and I had to your read all these chemical reactions that are saying what's going on and read about all these big words I never seen before just how incredibly
 Nicole that information was not a different sense and having to come up with strategies and ways to quickly understand absorb at jurong exam that skill has translated very very well and I'm learning about ruby and Frameworks gems all kinds of things that was so forward to me when I first started attitude of the training that I got the sense that it was very mechanistic process where you you learn almost like a flowchart of how to do things and I feel like that is something that contrasts sharply with software engineering where there's there's a little more creativity and and latitude in in how you can do things I wonder if maybe that's something that the medical process could learn from software engineering you think that's that's unfair to say
 so I remember taking this one class I think it was called a million physiology and up and down cuz I see her here and up until that point I felt like everything I learned about medicine was very good black and white like he said it was slow charge it was memorization yeah I use a ton of flash card that was it just happens it's this said if it happens if this other thing and that was it and when I took that he was the first exam and we did the other forces Amazon Cardiology and we had to look at it when we pick out the kg chart and all of a sudden it wasn't black and white anymore because the EKG charts that were from your patience and Dave did not match exactly to my textbook you know you know beautiful charge that were so clear with the point of the Lugia it didn't match up quite interpretation it took right and there were so many and and that was the first exam I said there is a little bit of art to this because it's not going to be a picture perfect it's not going to be as clear-cut
 you still have to use your experience in your God and your fuel to kind of figure out what makes up I did just no limits that at the end of the day that you have to diagnose a patient and kind of pick one way to do things but I do think there's more creativity in medicine giving a horse I'm not actually a doctor but I think is more crazy than medicine that I initially thought there was an end I guess it's starting with your your career at NPR you spent some time at NPR how well does NPR understand what is going on in the world of technology
 I have a question so when I was there I were some show called tell me more Michelle Martin and what we did this is definitely not a focus on technology I'm it was more what was just you know kind of General I think I remember pitching a story on bitcoin but I think I had to do a little bit of convincing to do because like no one can understand the relevance of Bitcoin and at that point I don't really understand it either I just knew it was a thing that we should cover and that and that led to more on like virtual currency and this whole life virtual economy of people buying for you know digital art that kind of thing is really interesting piece but I can say that now NPR is definitely taking to show a lot more seriously at the very least on their text side and they've done a lot of work a lot of Open Source work on building digital tools for journalists and I'm you're working in that area and they've been very very vocal about it they don't really great but Tech blog for the internal team
 I don't know how much that influence has carried over to covering stories on technology but I know that like podcasting something you're taking a lot more seriously and Billy building up their Tech Arsenal is David doing over the years for some of these media organizations to report on highly technical topics like I think Bitcoin is a perfect example because it's so hard to get it right like what you're actually reporting on and I mean I saw a documentary just last week about Silk Road and in it they spent like 40 minutes talking about Bitcoin and the sense that they talked about was like here's a way that you can send money electronically and it and that was it and I was like you did mention the term distributed Ledger like that like you did didn't even get it end but that's totally understandable cuz like how would you how would you even be able to Grapple with that concept as an old media report
 are doing that with only you know so much time to work on a story like that so what did you learn at NPR that you have applied to podcasting for me it is to rely on the guest exactly the example you gave I try not to be the person of knowledge on my show I try to let the guest be the star and I take a back seat and I let them know kind of own their knowledge on their expertise and on their own story and that's been a huge part of the success of our show when I was the NPR as well you know we did a lot of research before the interviews I would send I was in our house Michelle Moore in a big stack of research I've done with data and all the stuff and she would somehow magically read through all of it and I know this because in the interview she would randomly pulled back so I know where like in the middle of the stack and I have no idea how she remember that you know that one data point just to have that question in
 yeah what I learned was it's important for the host to have some contacts in background information so they can have an intelligent conversation but to not make it about me the host knowing all the answers being the expert of the show but really taking a step back and letting the guest take that conversation wherever it goes and then letting them be the star right
 your company has important projects that need to get done the IOS app needs to be Rewritten for Android the database needs to be migrated your continuous deployment system needs to be built the website needs a complete redesign but you don't have enough software engineers and designers to get all this work done top towel is here to save you talk give you exclusive access to the top 3% of freelance Talent software engineers and designers from python to PHP top tail has the freelance Talent you need to get your project finished on time with top quality in the past we had to worry about flaky Freelancers with poor communication skills unreliable internet connections subpar technical skills show on top Taos screens for these kinds of things and only works with seasoned professionals with tremendous problem solving skills personality and drive

 we live in unique times the nature of work is changing and more and more industry-leading companies from Airbnb to JPMorgan are realizing the benefits of scaling quick and staying flexible by working with Elite Freelancers so if you're short on resources for your projects check out top tile.com SE daily thanks to top tile for sponsoring the show now let's get on with this episode did Eric Schmidt came out with a while ago called the new digital age and one of the things that he talked about in that book was the idea that giant media organizations are going to be replaced by overtime by smaller smaller more vertical lies organizations and one of the ways that I think this is playing out in the media landscape is that these
 supposedly objective media organizations like the New York Times or Wall Street Journal or so on it you know insert your giant supposedly objective media organization here is getting is getting broken down and replaced by a more tightly vertical perhaps inherently subjective organizations such as software engineering daily or code newbie or you know I don't know something else that's that's tightly vertical do you think there is room for both of these types of organizations
 so that's a tough question I think it depends on what it means to have room right for me when I did journalism and I was NPR there was a huge sense of pride in the work that we did in graduating get paid very much especially compared to you know developer salary and we worked incredibly incredibly hard but there was a huge sense of Pride and it wasn't the other Pride wasn't just that being able to work at a place like NPR it was in the story itself the other remember times where I would get very very well so we small things wrong in my reports weather at see how confusing a Eye-Fi for an aid when I was writing it down or you just just really small things it would kill me you absolutely kill me and that level of your Bose details mattered so so so much I've invited a story on abortion which ends up being just a huge Fiasco and it was specifically on
 abortion in the end kind of targeting minorities specifically African Americans at planned parenthood's role in in targeting them and whether or not that was true and we had to guess one who was for one who was opposed and you know I I personally had no opinions on that topic so it was pretty easy for me to come in very objective and you know I tried to get two different guess you were very very interesting in their views and ask them questions and I realized after the fact that there were certain things in the way that I placed the story and frame the story that ended up being you know that end up looking like we were swinging one way or another and I didn't mean to at all but that was not my intention so something like saying anti-abortion versus you know a pro-life right like that says something about your opinion and those were like those small little details that I just didn't think about in the moment that I was very upset
 myself or after the story aired I'm so that level of just caring right that level of a passion on making sure you have balance stories and good sources that was a huge huge part of the culture of working at a place like NPR does that culture exist at those smaller vertical organizations right does that exist at a place that does not have many many years of journalistic authority that the New York Times has that is probably like biggest biggest concern whenever I read a blog post or you know an article that might be a blog post I'm still not sure where we draw the line on that and I look at you know what they publish in their stories in the weather for him very upset again very very upset I get upset at the lack of resources lack of sources the fact that the source is one tweet from two years ago from one random person and that's your the backing of his like that stuff really pisses me off typos annoying the crap out of me if your if you have advertisers who are paying the
 on your site you need to not have typos you need to have commas in all the right places and so what you know when we talk about is there room I think there is because of money because of businesses you know I think that's vertical more nice smaller Publications I'm going to guess probably have an easier time getting your ad sales and I'm working with partners because they're gearing towards a very specific audience and they can speech that the audience I want better than a more General publication info from a business perspective from a purely Financial opportunity perspective yes there's definitely room for smaller ones best for society and what's best for our knowledge and making sure we have good solid objective reporting information maybe I'm just a little bit concerned about the quality of information that will get over the long term is what ends up happening is bigger institutions ended up and up staying out because they don't know how to make the same amount of money in this current landscape compared to the smaller
 got it so let's get back to you talking about something more relevant to programming I guess you work full time at Microsoft and you manage the tech jobs Academy what is this program shorter so it is a 16 week full time at Mercy of Technical Training Program does a partnership between our Sun City Tack which is a community college part of the Cutie system in New York City and part of the New York City Government Tech Talent pipeline which is a 10 million dollar initiative to get more people into takkan to get them access to these really great opportunities in technology and so it's a 4 month program for our first cohort we're almost halfway to the program at this point which was 25 absolutely incredible people the program is serving unemployed and underemployed New Yorker is making less than $50,000 a year so we're really trying to give an opportunity to people who may not traditionally have access or
 sources to access the tech industry so that's what we're doing in tech jobs Academy sure it's very very diverse so we have people who are your recently out of school recently out of college and Yo Gotti associate's degree so for this first cohort they can't have a four-year degree but a lot of her students to have some college experience we have people who have parents actually have one student him who recently that his wife had a baby and had to lie down take care of her and then it's like come back to class and keep going with the program he's a trooper absolute credible guy until we've had a number of parents we have people who have had exposure to Tech but not been the tech person Pattinson where to buy story where they they were in HR working alongside the it folks and did you overhear their conversations but couldn't really be
 private things like that and then we have people who have done some tech work more on your help desk and that level of support will really looking to level up and laundry true career and it what's the curriculum
 sure the curriculum is mostly teaching Microsoft Technologies in so it's Windows Server active directory a lot of private Cloud stuff as soon as you're in there so one of the things that we've seen with our employer ecosystem who hit leverage Microsoft products is that they are moving away from Strictly on site server infrastructure and moving to the cloud so there's some degree of white hybrid going on there and so a big part of our focus in the program is teaching the quote on quote tritional system administration stuff but also learning about the clouds that as we move toward that they don't have the skills to be able to speak to that I can get jobs in that area and then we also have two other components we have a small math component which is really helpful years to get some contacts and make sure he bought the same page and then we have a soft skills to put it which is my part so a lot of what I do is on technical blogging which is funny they're all very very scared of technical Walking Dead no idea what I was talking about
 and then they wrote some absolutely incredible very user-friendly very wonderful tutorials on the things that they're learning there a lot of it is also writing abilities speaking abilities and I'm making sure that you not only do the job but prove to someone in an interview that you came to the job so that's the curriculum that were working which is this program where inmates are learning to code and one of the things that the guy that we had on West Bailey he said was that when they started creating the program they assumed too much about what students new and they actually need to dial back the the types of things that that that they were teaching in order to actually create creative curriculum that was open to two other two two people that really didn't have enough experience
 experiences like this where you like you just take something for granted when you're teaching these these people and and you have to dial it back and teach them something that I don't know expose your naivete about the situation that we found out it wasn't quite there that first week and so we had to spend some time reviewing some more time Deschanel pieces before they can really dive into the meat of the materials that's definitely happen happen to me personally take that I said I teach some of the career development soft skills part of things too and I assume that everyone knew what a tech blog was and a lot of them did not and they thought you know what I think of a Blog I'm thinking of you cat pictures on Tumblr any of the idea that you could write basically an article on the web for people to see that had a lot of really rich technical information which is a totally new car
 I want I realize that I had to write another little workshop where we dissected a tech blog and we pulled up some examples and we went through literally sentence by sentence what the purpose was and what it is and how we can replicate some of those best practices so I definitely been guilty those assumptions so as you're going through this curriculum development I'm sure you're thinking a lot about education and there's all these different ways that you can learn programming these days there's obviously the traditional computer science curriculum there are coding bootcamps and there are online courses and then they're all kinds of other methodologies
 what are the things that we talked about a lot is on on this shows is
 you know what is the worth of the computer science degree these days and obviously you haven't been through they computer science curriculum but judging from your perspective on the landscape is a computer science degree still worth it or it you know has it has it been subsumed by these alternative education paths
 that's a really good question I like that one so I think that it's still relevant I think that if you want to work at the absolute top 10 tech companies I think you probably do unfortunately have to have a computer side street I know that's changing so for example I on the Google doing a lot of work on reaching out to let you know people and people with Lester show backgrounds and talking and not being a strict as it used to be with both having it also graduating from Justice of both having the degree is having a degree from a place that is very prestigious so I think that worshiping I think that's changing I don't think it's completely consumed by the boot camps and all that I think that there are just so many caps there so many of them there's all mine ones are in person one and I get emails all the time from people you know who are
 these programs you want to be on the show and want to use it as a waiter yeah if you go to podcast but yeah it is it's kind of awkward because yeah that's usually what I say you know we can't have you on the show cuz we don't want the show to be basically a huge no product placement for your company but if you want to be a sponsor you know we do have those opportunities I try to find that lights and also the importance of finding that line comes back to having worked at NPR being a journalist and trying to respect the boundaries right between middle of the man business like that's a line that I care about I try to walk and people who may not have that in the background may not even recognize should be there
 but I ask you a question about who campson and new ways of learning I think that because there are so many of them there's a huge range in Quality Air ones that are very very good very strong and then there's some that are not quite there mostly because it's a really you feel that's a really new thing that I think you can still ladies 6 years old 7 years old is probably at the oldest that are bootcamp can be at this point and we just as an industry have a lot to learn about what works you know there is this assumption that three months to learn a new skill is enough time and maybe it is for some people maybe it's not for others I think that's not a strict of a rule that they definitely were still figuring out of her playing with what do you learn about how much time do you spend learning Ruby vs. rales how much time do you spend learning JavaScript vs. your other parts of the front end yet there's so many questions but I don't think we have really good answers to and I think
 until we get better answers and more data points I don't think that you have these programs right now at this point are totally taking over the computer science degree I think of the other thing is because we can't sarso new a lot of companies just don't know if they are a good resource yet right I know a lot of companies who try that out thank there an amazing solution and beliefs and buy them but they're still relatively New Concept where is he has to agree is like the standard write the replacing the standard was going to take a little bit more time
 well speaking of somebody who has gone through the computer science program and then talked to a bunch of people doing bootcamp on the podcast my brush is it actually these boot camp teach things that the computer science curriculum actually just does not teach at all like much of this stuff that you tackle on your show the psychological hurdles the ability to focus on something and the ability to
 self direct this is something that a computer science curriculum at at at at at a university often times we'll just a shoe completely because it is this cuddling atmosphere where you are walked through everything in the boot camp it's even called a boot camp because they they whip you and they say at the end of 3 weeks or 6 6 weeks or whatever we're kicking you out and you're going to have to be able to fend for yourself unlike Computer Science Education universities which is like yeah this is like this indefinite four to eight year process you know you're registered nurse learning throughout it and anyway I don't mean to soapbox but I personally am a much bigger fan of the boot camps from a economic perspective than the computer science degree that's a really good point because I think the question is
 no do you learn something that is directly applicable to the job right at bootcamp does not have time to talk about a lot of the court of code fundamental computer science Concepts and talk about the history in do you have to learn the things that you need to learn to do the job and it's very very specific and very Taylor to that and so in terms of
 the beat the return on investment right if your goal is how much money do I need to spend to get a very decent job was entry-level job in this field boot camps are probably a very efficient solution of acetic conceptually from so whenever we have guests on the podcast of of people who have computer science grade I was trying to ask you know was it worth it you have now that you've done it have you have you have you learned all things that you need to learn and for the most part the answer has been no for the most part most guest say I just wasn't really worth the money and experience but I do know that at least a handful of guests have said that it's a good way to have background on contacts and just have a better appreciation for computer science and have that but it wasn't enough now there wasn't enough directly applicable stuff to get the first job that these computer science universities
 it's that there is the set of fundamental secrets that only the university can bestow upon you that is a mess the boot camps can teach you what you need to know and Justice idea that oh maybe in the University there's some sort of theoretical secrets you know maybe the machine learning the AI the NLP any other acronyms with higher education computer science these are all myths and anyway they're designed to perpetuate imposter syndrome and get people to attend computer science higher education so anyway moving beyond my personal gripes with higher education
 when you engage with people who are not programmers but are you know that they want understand Tech what are the biggest misconceptions that people have about programming and have about technology in the broader world I think I will have a better on know how do I explain to my family what it is that I do and those are a lot of fun making lots of really fun stories out of that out of those for your chest and so one of the big ones that's just kind of bait they really have no sense of what web development is there there's no understanding of what the difference is between a website and a web app and how they can be the same thing but aren't necessarily the same thing your concept of like a back and front end that's totally lost on people just kind of these big categories of things around how Developers
 working there till 7 and then the Holly think about technology that is completely lost on people I think there's also a huge confusion with no because software developer and learning how to fix your Internet we get a lot of those to get a lot of stories of people saying I appreciate that they're different Specialties that's probably one of the bigger challenges and misconceptions in the in the non-tech world exactly you're in New York
 from living in Seattle I sometimes get the sense that I am missing out from living in San Francisco where all the action is supposedly happening what's your impression for how the American texting varies from City to City
 oh that's a good question so so I'm I'm very I'm not a very good New York City developer cuz I don't generally go to events and I I love being here cuz I like the idea that I could go to events if I wanted to but I generally have not been very good at Liberty his opportunities and I think that when I first start in Tech startup world I went to everything I was all the conferences all the jobs that every single day I had an event I was not working I was meeting people and I think that once I got a little bit more comfortable and once I got here a little more just it I didn't do it as much as I used to I do most of my network working honestly on Twitter and just online but I can tell you that for the tech seed in your city there really two there is one which is more to start up seeing what is the part that I was supposed to know you're with and the start of seeing is he have people very much focused on their money on VC's how do I become the next
 Instagram you that I was really the focus the conversation the guess they were interviewed were hardly ever the ciccio's or you know any Realtek people it was the business people all the sales people at the marketing everybody who wasn't actually working on the product and that you know was it that time cuz I didn't know any better either you got to know about Tacker coating on E that that was very exciting I thought it was really cool I'm I really want to be part of that world and then I became a developer there's a whole other side right there's a whole other Tech Community which is just on developers and you know we focus on the code and the product then we have more product manager is end designers and you know programmers in ciccio's and the conversations there are just so so different the focus is so so different culture is so so different and I feel very lucky that I've been so embedded in both of these cultures that I can kind of compare and contrast I like the developer one a lot more a lot more to the point
 a lot more honestly a lot more welcoming I think we're a lot more and we try you know we're very aware of our flaws and I feel like we are trying to Augusta when it comes to inclusion you know and it being more diversity and all that good stuff and so I really really like the developer Community a lot here there's many opportunities to get involved there is lots of people trying to make it more welcoming to newcomers in beginners and when I've gone to different cities and it's incredible you know most of my time is spent in Ruby communities in when I go to different conferences and I want to the world everyone is so nice like everyone is so freaking nice and I are the first conference I want I think her to walk us about it I was really scared cuz I didn't know what to expect I heard terrible things about the tech industry and the black women so I didn't know how that was going to work out and you know when I got there everyone was just so incredibly warm and welcoming and I thought it was probably just as one conference
 Australia and India in a bunch of different cities in the u.s. in the movie Community has been consistently welcoming and kind Tim is really really nice and so I don't know how much that speaks to all of the developer Community but in my experience is a good one it's like I expected the floodgates of assholery to open until just be you know to be I don't know I'm ostracize somehow are criticized and it just never happened and it was yeah it's weird yeah it was weird but it's it's a great thing so your initial goal of learning to program if I understand correctly was catalyzed by seeing people make things and get to be true creators true entrepreneurs
 is this creation process this entrepreneur entrepreneurship is this for everyone
 no oh my God no is not at all I think that one of the one the first business books I read was Lean Startup and in Lean Startup it's very private about men focused it's weird it's like if you read the book you know it's I'm pretty sure what's his name yeah I'm pretty sure he was the CTO of that company at the time but it's like Hail to the business before I think it's much more positive outlook and and if you read it it's all about it raining in all about learning and you try really small thing you tried a very small feature you test it out and get some results you tweak and you just keep doing that until you finally find in a product Market fit and the thing about that that I hate is the trying things out and getting data because you know in practice how do you know if your data is good data do you have enough data points is asking three of your friends enough information is it have to be 20 strangers on the internet what is the way that you found those drinkers was all incredibly bias
 because it was from this one tweet that this one you know I T guy to get it out for you yummy they're just there so there's there's so much ambiguity around how much data and how do you know and the beta's Never black and white even if you do have a good day to stop and just that whole process is just very very frustrating and annoying and I think that for a lot of people who attempted to do that model and you part about my quote-unquote the right way that's been a huge paint going to figure out how to do that I think it's very different from what we talked about on the developer Community where it's more about holding it on your craft and you know having best practices making sure your code is very clean and hit that side of things it's just a different right that one is the goal is almost a painting Perfection to a degree right it's it's making something it's beautiful that's part of it is Artistic and it's a very different thing from iterating and feeling feeling feeling until you finally get it right I don't like the feeling exam until you get it right I like the cross part of things
 and I didn't realize it that was such a big part of being a programmer Lisa culture being a programmer until I did it but I'm really glad that exist
 yeah okay so I want to begin to close off you've been very gracious with your time the code newbie podcast and Community Twitter chat it's very impressive what is in the future for code newbie yes it's going to be amazing because everyone kept requesting it and I was holding off for very long time and then finally I broke down so we have three and we're launching our fourth one this Friday so we have one in Austin Atlanta Philly and watching women Dallas Emily have plans to launch a couple more and Nashville and DC and Indianapolis so this year we're going to be really appreciate it in person to beat up stuff you were looking for in a liter
 how to spell the community outreach an entirely new audience when we started doing it on meetup.com I was very very surprised actually flew down to Austin which is our first one so you know be there for the first meet up and supported me people and we had about 20 people come out for you going to restaurant and had drinks and you hung out and got to know each other and I was just so shocked that no one at the table I actually heard of code nudity and didn't know that it was a thing they only heard about going to be on meetup.com like they thought the Austin one was the only like code newbie thing that's been consistent for a lot of the meetups that we have and would that really told me was hot meetup.com is a great channel to reach people who starred on Twitter you know as much as I am and aren't you don't do the online stuff as much as I would and so it's been a really great way to reach more people on and help more people learn to code so we're doing a lot more meetups I were working on having the code to be conference which I'm really excited
 Sprouts are we shooting for sometime in your October November of fall we're currently picking a location for it but it's most likely going to be in Atlanta until really really excited about that and you know my goal is just to keep going to keep doing the podcast and keep finding more guests and then keep telling me stories
 okay that's awesome I was playing stuff I could have gotten to that I wanted to discuss but I will let you get on with your Saturday if you ever have anything else you want discussed feel free to come on the show us around there on message of code newbie so they are so much and let me know if I can ever help in any way from one podcaster to another so it was a real pleasure having you on scraping on the show yes really good questions really excited to be here that weekend that were said anyway cool thanks thank you so much no problem

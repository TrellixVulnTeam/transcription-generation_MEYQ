Transcription: in The Last 5 Years companies started hiring and data Engineers a did engineer creates the systems that manage and access the huge volumes of data that are accumulating on cheap Cloud servers is the saying goes it's more expensive to throw out the data than to store it in today's episode peach soda Lake George the show to discuss the rise of the data engineer and how that role interacts with data scientist software engineers and machine learning experts Pete runs hacker Labs a site that Aggregates material for data science and data engineering he also organizes data inch conf a conference for data engineering and speaking of conferences and social Gatherings around software if you are in the Bay Area on January 11th come check out the software engineering daily meet up there will be some awesome speakers some food a great atmosphere and you can find more information on software engineering daily.com or at the software engineering daily meet up page it's at

 Pizzeria long run tackle ABS a platform for data Engineers Pete welcome to software engineering daily data engineering is this specialization that arose because of a variety of factors it become cheaper for companies to store their data so users are engaging with their devices more there's more dated store and in order to make use of that data you actually need a data scientist at your company to perform in Dallas on it you don't get value out of the date of by just having it stored on your servers and then the data scientist they're experts and do a gait analysis they're not as for the experts in the scalable distributed systems so we needed new architectural patterns to handle all of this data and perform analysis and this role called Data engineer a rose would you say that to Accurate explanation for the historical origin of the data
 engineer roll a partially I think that you just articulated some really like present meaningful Dynamics in data teams the interplay between the data scientist in the data engineering what that really means and that's a key thing that you know I'm interested from a community building in Crawfordsville in town point but I think they make it skipped over is just the plethora of consumer data that's come online through social networks another are large internet platforms over the last 10 years just the prevalence of that data in and of itself has sort of pushed forward processing architectures and just the need for companies to be able to capture that in one that weighs
 so this role data engineer you know company like Spotify or Netflix and maybe they were engineers who were spending all their time at this company they were building infrastructure for data and they weren't spending any time Building user-facing Services So eventually they just became these this role of data engineer and it and then overtime this provided more and more companies have you seen in the evolution of this emphasis on data Engineering in the last 5 or 10 years how is it how is it affected the structure of companies no one is born a data engineer engineer to come from all kinds of other backgrounds you know somewhere DBA is summer back-end engineer summer distributed systems Engineers that this is a hold of moniker data engineer it's such a new term and
 I'm probably about 3 or 4 years ago when we started the data engineering meet up in New York and San Francisco you know the term was not even necessarily uncommon knowledge like you didn't have a title data engineer unless you worked at perhaps Facebook or maybe Google companies that had like such large amounts of data historically so now we're starting to see the term for the be defined as we start to play with that and you know as a compliment to data science I think there's a lot of like for Layton you know definition. That makes sense but but even before data engineer is in contrast to a data scientist I think there's a bigger meme which is that you know software Engineers are eating all of the other kinds of rolls and team so you know what I was an engineer I'm in the late 90s we had a QA department and we had an into structures apartment and we had a DBA team and we had a
 WebMD 19 and now it seems like software Engineers just overall are eating all of those rolls so I'm part of that I think bubbles up of data engineering where a lot of teams you know don't even necessarily have a DBA team anymore just totally expected at the software Engineers do that work so there's a couple of different like kind of sociological pressures that have have made the data engineer emerge on today as is what it is and it's still obviously being defined and what have you been doing the last 5 or 10 years as we have had this boom and data engineering from what vantage point if you've been watching this evolve my quick history from 10000 feet is I'm a self-taught engineer from the early 90s turned web engineer in the late 90s and early 2000s where to hit the first internet bubble in stride then in 2003 I discovered I probably wasn't as great of an engineer as I wanted to be and maybe I should do something
 something slightly different so I started my first company I've been super passionate about you know Technology and Engineering ever since and didn't want to leave the field even though I wasn't the best engineer so I decided to stop in the vein of either helping Engineers I'm with their career or in the case of my second startups try to security with built-in online cloud-based data processing platform in 2008 2009 assorted very early at its time so I've been highly involved in I'm building technical products in the date of space and then most recently over the last 5 years I've been building Community for engineer so how collabs which is my current company which was the precursor to data and cough shot glasses building an online platform I'm similar to LinkedIn to help connect engineer's together to help him solve problems on find mentors or find careers
 so it was sort of the Holy Grail social network for engineers that I don't think anyone is successfully been able to build yet but I spent around that space for a while and ultimately many have tried and someone argues I get Hub is the social network which it is not it's a it's a tool for code hosting in collaboration with people that you mostly already know not for discovering Engineers that you don't know so I have a lot to say about sort of social networks an engineer's but you know we engineer's are not typically that social so sometimes it's a bit like pushing a rock up a hill so that would be a whole other part of the story that I can get into but I had a big long detour with building social platforms for engineers and finally I gave up on that and realize that some of the meetups get started engineering and others we were building real Community friends in yours IRL and so we abandon at least for now the the digital version of that platform and decided to focus
 fun events for engineers and that's how the day to end conference was born started last year it is funny how these communities tend to develop from things you don't expect to form into a community or you don't play this podcast you know I can I can relate to what you said about you know don't want to be a joke I'm not the best engineer so I should start and Lead something it which it which by the way might be counterintuitive for some people they might think will if I'm not the best engineer at a company why would why on Earth would I start a company I don't have to be the best engineer to start a company and that's definitely not true that's not a side note but you know I as this has gotten kind of popular like a community has kind of developed around it just coincidentally what you just said he seems like that it happens anytime you have product that is
 is actually useful to people developing a set of engaged users can happen around it products and that's what a lot of us shoot for you know a lot of us were serial startup founder shoot for and that's a beautiful thing I guess when I started chocolate labs I knew I wanted to build something to help Engineers with their careers probably because I was a self-taught engineer and was always kind of feeling my way around and partly because I saw a lot of other Engineers who did NASA really have set career paths that they recognized they had the sense that they wanted to be a CCO but didn't realize there's you know at least three or four different kinds of ctOS would it really know how to get there let alone choose which one they wanted and and perhaps they even you know that they weren't particularly strong and some of the social skills are like Network building that someone like a salesperson friends
 time does sort of by second nature so when I started hacker Labs I knew I wanted to help Engineers with these kinds of problems but I didn't know what the product was so I didn't start with a product I just started trying to engage and juniors with content I'm originally was an email newsletter that I sent out just to see if I can get them to care and engage about the kinds of stuff that I thought I had a thesis around around the business and so we started building community Through content even before we had a product and it was later on at the park and merge that we then like dropped into this you know someone Vibrant Community we had and and and and took a spin on the product side but we kind of worked outside in which is not something that a lot of people do and I think it's just proof of the fact that you know getting engagement with with users in any kind of way around a particular steam can help you advance your thesis or not
 choosing the tools for my side projects the first thing that I look for is ease-of-use that's why I love Mongo. It is the most popular non-relational database and it is super easy to use at the beginning of a project I often don't know the shape of my objects and Mongo makes it easy to evolve the database schema as I like overtime overtime as my project gets popular I'm going to need to scale and thankfully mongodb has built-in horizontal scalability but configuration and database maintenance aren't really what I want to spend my time on thankfully mongodb Atlas was released in 2016 mongodb Atlas is the easiest way to get access to mongodb without having to run the database yourself you pay only for what you use for small projects all the way up to large production deployments to try mongodb
 Atlas today go to mongodb. Com SE daily and get a free $25 in credit use promo code go Atlas 25 to get that $25 in free credit Atlas is the only hosted mongodb service built by the engineers behind the database the company mongodb with Atlas you get into end encryption you get VPC peering you get access to the latest releases and for a limited time you can go to mongodb. Com SE daily enter promo code go Atlas 25 and get that $25 in credit and get started with mongodb Atlas thanks to mongodb for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily and thanks for being the database behind a lot of my favorite side projects in the past we're really happy to have mongodb as a new sponsor of software engineering daily
 the idea of building a social network for engineers I'm a little curious about your attempt at that in and what went wrong the the thesis for this company is for the for the Social Network for engineers company is always like oh you know if we get these Engineers together and they're all in this platform it's a great place to give them ideas for jobs and maybe serve them ads for engineering products with a high CLTV it's a very compelling idea and it seems like I'm an engineer I would want a social network for engineers I spend time on stackoverflow bedtime I get up whether or not it's a social network we could debate but what what was the difficulty like was it classic chicken and egg thing or what what what happened
 but I think now we have more tools that help us start to you know blow that problem apart and get more Tomic about about how to get to scale no social network starts at scale getting the scale of the Holy Grail and if you do presumably it has so much value for every person than that work in different ways that you succeed but you just there's just no possible way to start a network without mechanism so you know I think with the with the the the products for what we know about starting products and auction and in solving a user's pain whatsoever social network for engineers it's no different like we thought long and hard to find out like what specifically is the pain of the engineer that we can solve how can we do that in the first person you know where the player one use case where we don't require all the value of the network to solve that problem because to be honest we don't have that Network yet so
 finding the smallest bit of pain you can software Engineers was really challenging for us you know with engineering tooling and other stuff sort of you know being fairly well develop so that was that was a challenging you know I could talk you through a couple of the way that we tried to do that but it didn't look like a social network necessarily at smaller scale just because I can't you can't you can't say you're going to watch social networking social network and succeed which is not what most people think but it's definitely true
 red and so this pain sounds like the small modicum of pan that you found was conferences for data engineers and data scientist perhaps you know the content aggregation tool the hacker Labs has developed into so we'll get back to talking about that but let's talk a little bit more about like data engineering and what's going on with the world of data engineering maybe that'll make it more clear to the listeners you know why why there's some areas of pain so is Dave engineering like a well-defined Rolex do we have a good picture for what it is is overlap with what a data scientist does you know how how well understood you know in the engineering community is the role of data engineer in the skill that it engineer needs to have I think it's definitely in evolution
 you know where it were made formation of this field and I think a lot of it is being driven by data science because we've had such great advances in the last 2 years and deep-learning and you know company successfully like training models on huge amounts of data that are becoming meaningful and far more effective from a product standpoint so you know the quantity data science C Machine learning AI stuff is like very sexy and it's finally coming into its own obviously I think there's a whole different discipline that requires somebody to parse process clean ETL present and T up that data for the for the quads to do anything with the first place and that I think is data engineering now that you know that being said there's a lot of tensions and sort of current teams whether your assed
 shut up and you want inside stream data so you going higher your first date a person and you hire a data scientist because that's what you do right and the data science comes to work on the first day and there's no data in any organized place and it's strewn all over 14 different systems and all of a sudden the data scientist has to sort of do his or her own engineering to like pull that data together that's a very common Pitfall we see in startup teams where they think they need a data scientist maybe they actually the data engineer first and then of course there's the the the Unicorn folks you know the machine learning engineer someone who can put both pieces together and that's an interesting you know sort of formation of skills as well which is highly highly valuable but many folks are not that type so ignoring the Unicorn engineer if we're talking about a company that is big enough to hire both of data engineer and data scientist or even
 did engineering team and a data science team is there a rough contract between the data engineer in the data scientist what is in the purview of the date engineering what is in the purview of the data scientist yeah I think you know what I see in it across Industries you know not just start up I've worked a lot of small teams I work with a lot of like top technical teams like on teams from Google or Facebook or Amazon but then there's also the Enterprise version of these teams and or there's the finance version of these right like quantitative sciency stuff in Wall Street is I'm super pervasive and those teams at 5 and working together almost as long as any data teams because originally you know in the late 90s early 2000s where I was working in New York building high frequency low latency trading platforms with something
 you know that those were some of the earliest data engineer as you might say who are teeing up on that stuff for the quantum Wall Street to work on so I'm some of the stuff is interesting enough it's very to Wall Street and it's being sort of uncovered or we discovered by you know by technical teams by the way I think it's no surprise that double click New York came out of the sort of the Wall Street culture and even to have a bit by add model for an ad Network novel at the time no surprise that started in New York plus there's a lot of like high frequency low latency engineering rigger that was required of the company like the double click. I think was like pending of Wall Street talent that service help.com music see how many way I would have been a side
 if you follow the ad industry much but I've been doing what shows about add Tack and like add fraud and I just funny because there's all these ad tech companies in New York and say why is that text so big in New York and it's because it's because the the layers of obfuscation and the auction models and the complexity of Wall Street completely mirrors that of advertising technology were you have buying and selling in Wren derivatives and repackaging accepted is even less regulated then Wall Street and yeah it's fascinating part of of the New York City engineering culture you know I've lived in both New York City and San Francisco Bay area and
 I deeply deeply respect the engineering culture of the Bay Area and I ordered things there that I never never would have learned anywhere else and it's amazing how to culture and then hearing culture tech companies but I'm sort of value in the in the software engineer universe and it's very strong when it comes to data so you know going back to your question about how did these teams in her act together I mean again I think it depends on sort of the size of your team but this is one of the things were trying to uncover with the data engineering conference and the community is we saw a few years ago that there were there were these questions about how these different personalities and rolls and skill sets in sides of the house needed to interact with each other across the engineering Adidas science and so the whole original you know mission of Big Ang cough was
 the bridge the gap between did engineering Adidas science and to put both groups in the same room because you know there's icml and there is some other machine learning conferences that are for the heater towards academic research and really hardcore Algos and machine learning data science side and then there was this emerging engineering world of data engineering and Duke and all the stuff and you get when you put these two trained people into a a data team off of time Sparks Fly and ones not an engineer and the other the engineer who is you know I'm responsible to implement production eyes code of machine learning models doesn't necessarily all the time not even the basic math about the August 3rd applying so we saw the Sparks Fly on teams in real life and decided Well it's time to try to bridge the gap between those two and even if we don't have all the answers which I don't at least we can create a community ecosystem where are we can put these two groups together
 the same room through content through conference for community and help them sort of figure it out and that's actually the mission of Big Ang cop is to explore this dynamic between did engineering Sciences like the devops movement absolutely you could have called it like datacomp or in inside in Cyrus Mehta service catchy so and I like it I mean already the conference Brandon Vision the silos between data engineering and data science science is this is there some pretty severe siloing between the data engineering teams in the data science teams
 happens between development operations or is it is it is it like more subtle or level of resentment which I remember very acutely like being an engineer in the late 90s and I think I mean still look still exist today I'll be at my first job out of school is it speaking of Trading Company I worked at Trading Company remember the oh my goodness there so many like operational difficulties that high frequency Trading Company end and the relationship between the engineering team in the operations team is fraught Shakespearean I love how comfy like Etsy is just like this is an aside but turn to the other on its head and just like brazenly declares if you if you build it you know you you run at you operate it so
 getting Engineers the keys to the to the infrastructure the production system it's just sort of assumed from day one so you know that was a bold move and I think they've been a great great for winter for some of the stuff okay so let's talk about some of the the areas of Dayton engineering this space is moving so fast it is so congested with all these different Technologies I had to show a while ago with Chris fregly Who does these press you heard of this guy so yeah I know crazy right okay so he does this like pancake stack presentation like pancake stack is a like a 12-letter 30 letter acronym of all these different Technologies you don't like most quotes tax are like it's like for Technologies in this is like a 13 or 14 technology Stacks it's it's kind of a
 well like the the punchline is just that there are the stacks are so thick so whether you're talking about you just like okay are stacked consist of Kafka Cassandra Docker meso like 8 other Technologies in this just saw this churn so I guess let's talk like I think the idea of the pancakes tags basically like look you've got this huge Pipeline and you got some requirements what are the requirements for a data engineering pipeline. Well that's this is something that's definitely changing all the time I mean I guess I was first sort of made aware of you know the need for for new and different technology like years ago with the no sequel movement and when we were all coming out of my sequel or postgres or not even coming out of just like really using hard relational databases
 you know that the no sequel world started to explode you know because of cop theorem Dynamics and and then some um some new research there so I remember at the time this is probably my first exposure to like how complicated data processing stock could become when I was simply about trying to choose and no sequel store like did you need something I'm key value in memory you know did you need something.. Just had eventual consistency like what the why did you want to get away from a relational data store in the first place like did you need to document for like Mongolian what the hell is mango good for anyway like there's all these kinds of questions and that was just a microcosm I think you're right of how complicated stuff would get even now in the present they were there's all kinds of different options for screen processing versus batch processing and you know Costco's word emerged as the standard and I miss Park taking over Hadoop and all these kinds of things and
 answers to all these things that I'm not a super super Hands-On engineer but it is exciting to to see this world explode and then again just to try to give engineer's context from members of our community to try to answer these problems and help him figure out like what is a reference reference of limitation for data pipeline about something that's changed over time and you don't want to be the community that helps engineer's discover on what's right for them which tools they should do is write a blog and just looking at all these posts about videos YouTube videos and conference talks and sings about data engineering it was very useful to me I was just seeing getting a lot of ideas for shows I could potentially do just by looking at the disaggregation of post you having me like when I go on YouTube I can get watch so many videos about about different software engineering topics the YouTube recommendations are decent but this was really a nice cure
 braided blog about data engineering so it anyway who's interested in that like when checking out the Hat collapse blog machine learning it really looks like it's going to be crucial to Competitive Edge and it's only going to get more crucial how is that I mean the driving one of the driving for I guess that must be one of the driving forces behind how aggressively Dayton Engineers are being hired you know how aggressively companies are scrambling to get their data engineering pipelines set up in a way that is easier to manage because you know until you get that data pipeline set up in a nice way it's probably hard to build machine learning models and that's 100 ways to kind of follow-up to your car
 what is the Strategic value of machine learning and I can kind of take us in a different direction if you want to chat about that but but before before that you know the other thing is I think there's a lot of Engineers out there and we discovered this summer Leon in building the day to end Community there's a lot of Engineers that are kind of good listening to the sirens call of machine learning in data science in the kind of wish they'd you know they could pick up some of that stuff and so sure they are like building these pipelines and tearing up the stuff for the for the the real quants you know Engineers are a highly technical bunch and we know math to and we we should like dial India science and you know we're tired of just playing with waiting parameters in elasticsearch I'm and we want to write some real like you know I'll go to ourselves so one of the things that we've seen in our community is this like real hunger for engineer's to learn more about data science and we want to we try to forget
 I'm not because we think it's it's good for both sides to sort of understand each other's language you know I think a lot of Engineers start to babble and data science and they realize at first blush like how much math is involved in that they learn quickly like which aspects of linear algebra and other things need to go back and sort of brush up on and bye bye getting closer to the date of Science in the real mouthy all goes through able to determine whether or not you know how deep they want to go in data science and do they really want to let become a data scientist or or augmentor engineering skills to become machine learning engineer or you know where they happy with that brush and now they go back to being an engineer but at least they speak the language of data science the data scientist in can Implement those all goes in a little bit more logical reasonable way I was at an event last night App Academy I was talking to some students are graduating this coding bootcamp and I was saying that
 if you don't like the job prospects that you're getting coming out of a coding bootcamp you could sit and you have some cash saved up if you see if you saw some cash saved up you could spend some money and not spend money on you could spend some time just learning data science and or data engineering learning machine learning because the stuff is actually pretty approachable like it seems like oh my gosh machine learning seems kind of crazy but the tooling has gotten so simple and educational resources have gotten so good that you actually don't need to spend that much time before you're like really like employable as a machine-learning not an expert but you'll be somebody that's useful to a company cuz cuz there's actually a dearth there such a dearth of expertise relative to how useful these tools are you think that's accurate is it is it that easy or was I was I being reductive yeah I think I think there's definitely the opportune
 can you take a boot camp boot camp graduate can spend two months on Coursera and become good enough to be like me know if data is data engineer data scientist yeah I mean I think there's other challenges to these boot camps on which you know maybe it's beyond our conversation a bit I think they're great and but I think that Real World experience in real project experience is Sochi I think that a lot of folks coming out of boot camps are learning this the hard way you know but but specifically your point I'm absolutely there's so much info online for sure probably kicked it off with some of their data science stuff but I'm also reminded of Clare corthell who published something on get her call the open source data science Master's and it's it's her version of a curriculum for data science and if you work through that
 if you have additional project appearance or or compressor already an engineer you just want to start to become familiar with like the ins-and-outs like I mentioned of how deep would you have to go to actually become a data scientist you know resources like that online are extremely valuable and they're free and they're open and available to everyone of data is data engineering but like these companies big companies I Can See For example has so much monitoring data and log data is that is that a responsibility of a data engineer does it does the date engineer manage the monitoring alligators at like a different role that's a great question you know we've had some companies speak on anomaly detection in production systems that are conference over the last year and I think this is a really interesting emerging and super highly technical right like we're not talking about really any user face
 for some data products were talking about a tool by Engineers for engineers to Crunch log data to help engineer's from an alerting perspective like determine the health of their systems I mean it's sort of like this this awesome engineering use case where we get to use data science like just to eat our own dog food which is pretty incredible so I think some of the largest internet companies are investing in this in their building custom systems to do this I mean something like that you know if I were to ever found her and sort of a product guy if I were to set up a team internally I'm to build that tool that would be a data engineer that would be a data scientist that would be a product manager and that might be obviously someone from the devops roofers are sure seem to sort of like make sense of of all of the infrastructure process and procedure as well but

 speaking of seti I did a show with James Turnbull who is the an Etsy he's been done operations a lot different companies she's very big in the devops community or monetary Community whatever you want to call it but I had them on to talk about his book The Art of monitoring and you know he talked about monitoring it as business status of business value you can scrutinize the Monitor and get it obviously for anomaly detection like you said or four things that are causing down time you can correlate these things you can also just like look at it 4 ways to get to maybe cut costs or because there's so much data coming off and because our infrastructure is done so complex by simply piping that data in two ways that lets you visualize it like just having a dashboard basically it can be really really high value because once you get that
 aggregated to way that you can visualize you'll be like oh I like this is pretty wasteful we should not have this no stuff over here well this will cut $200,000 of cost you know simple decision and what you go back to what I was asking about is like being able to to grasp and manipulate this data is is so complex because the streams are moving so fast it's theirs producing so much data it is a data engineering problem collecting your monitoring data is as complex of a data engineer problem as collecting all of the UGA that user data that you know from using Facebook on your phone or something basically the same problem now there's there's all of this data going through Amazon's Cloud even from a strategic standpoint you know because I think sometimes like a product person and even an investor
 you don't Microsoft just released I'm sorry Google just released Google Cloud released I'm a bunch of machine learning API just before Thanksgiving that are sort of new way is to get value from the Google Cloud if you deploy your apps there you could value through these machine learning AP eyes and in some cases these machine learning if you guys are actually representative of different products that that even are your own but you know Google has the ability to to to build these highly relevant the machine learning and sleepy eyes because they have so much data to train and if that's another reason for you to deploy your app on Google Cloud will have even more data trainer api's with so this Cooks more the strategy of like what place does machine learning have four different sized companies whether you're a start-up for medium or large company but there's some really interesting things happening with the aggregation of all the states
 especially on public you know somebody public laws what we think of this type of clouds what are the differentiating factors between the Google cloud in Amazon Cloud perhaps the Microsoft cloud as as we evolve into the future and right now that looks like these clouds are kind of trying to replicate each other because we're still in very early days of cloud we're still just building the basic compute Primitives you know stuff like queuing and you know just basic storage database technology but we're going to see more more of these high-level services are AP eyes and it sounds like you're talking about something with with Google this machine machine learning a pH what what do you mean by that and are these things that are extremely differentiated on Google are they not represent on AWS
 yeah so the services I mentioned just to be clear that Google announced like they have a job search API and I forget some of the other ones yeah it's a it's some you check out the Google Cloud blog it was a way to find relevant jobs based on skill set I'm from what I recall it it's it's an intricate sort of it and I don't know if it's this project or exactly what their strategy is there but they're sort of showing how machine learning API is deployed by Google can leverage a lot of the data and the relevancy algorithms. Google has already built so I'm disability SSI mentioning specifically might not be a reason necessarily right now to choose Google Cloud over BWI to other services although
 you know I know I'm a juror is also developing machine learning tools and their Cloud as well so it's kind of very early on with some of the stuff so I don't want to answer to punch above my weight class here but I'm referring to see interesting stuff emerge especially as it relates to machine learning features and services being offered by these clouds and I think it may become a competitive differentiation I'm at some point show this job search API are you saying this is like like Google crawled the internet for jobs are or something where you can like customize it yourself but I don't quite understand jobs API and you can read about it on the cloud platform blog that Google. Google runs it was just announced before Thanksgiving so I probably shouldn't talk about it like to specifically because I
 but if anyone's interested they can find info on the Google Cloud platform blog seniority alignment this is some real it's it says Cloud jobs API Alpha and Alpha job search and Discovery powered by Machine learning well well I also know of any that's probably the most tangential thing I just pulled up the black folks as well refresh my memory are you sure I think is a perfect example because the reasons are perfect examples of shows like how high-level the API that people are going to build on top of their clouds are and like this is still a very technical product but it's not it's not like storage and moving and ec2 it's like totally differentiated that's why I like cloud is not
 exactly a commodity business it like we're in the commodity days right now but as time goes on there going to look less and less commodified well it's interesting in the same blog post you know that's the this is about the jobs API is the highest level if you had it they talk about then in the same blog post is bundled stuff on how they're announcing gpus for Google cloud and how they have this Cloud Vision API where you can you know pump in images and you know get that image recognition capability so so you know they both in the same block posts they have both like low-level and high-level kind of stuff and it's all lumped together in into machine learning features and even a new group within Google for cloud machine learning tools but you know we see all the stuff sort of emerge all at one time the same Block Plus which is kind of fascinating
 exciting times okay well so we should talk a little bit more about hacker labs and they dance comp your community that your building so as I understand hacker Labs is this started this platform for connecting did Engineers did scientists companies it evolve into this blog where there's all these posts and videos about data engineering and at a certain point you you decide to start a conference you've been doing meet ups and stuff where is the company at today or what are you what are you doing in regards to conferences in this is where I could put on my finder how to talk like a founder of you know building any Community we started talking about building a social network and monetizing a social network that's not scale is relatively impossible so sort of just because of the economic pressures of what we were trying to Bill
 golden the fact that we had some traction but not a truck not an attraction that scale you know I was I'm so passionate about working with engineers and continuing to work in the most Innovative technical fields that I can and I didn't want to give up the company even though the social network hadn't worked so I'm just as a matter of necessity on we launched a conference to monetize the network that we had and it turns out at work and so we were able to you know by more time where I can continue to invest in working with data scientist and data Engineers you know I'm doing product advising and some Consulting I'm an advisor for 500 startups and so I'm always looking for interesting tools for engineers that we can but I can help bring some Market I'm so you know a I get a chance to continue to play in the space and then specific with your question through the conference the conference because of the cash flow positive business
 you know how some girls potential because we're in such a hot space what we want to do with the conferences we want to build the Ted for data science if you will and when it comes to you no content cop Princeton Community I think a company like Ted did really amazing it in there live events on super high quality content then they distributed that content really effectively and built a brand on YouTube I think the third part that maybe they didn't quite do as well as they could is build like real vibrant local communities as for the last stage of that about strategy and that's what we did and cock becoming you know it's a great event I'm at super high quality content on we have a lot of experience with content distribution online from the earliest version 2 Pock I'm doing content marketing for engineers and the next stage of that process is to build really amazing vibrant worldwide Community is for data professionals on that we can plug plug
 you're not working can get value from the comedian that we're building a little more of diluted value the front head right and you know it's it's still like it's kind of like a meet-up version of Todd right and you know we're playing without strategy a little bit as well but I think the question is how exactly to you build like repeatable regular frictionless opportunities for your community to to connect you know in Regional or local areas apart from running large events and that's kind of a tricky one but that's something that we're working on as well yeah but I do love meetups I mean I move to San Francisco recently and I don't know like I don't know a ton of people like I have some I have some close friends but I don't have like a real community in like this podcast is been a long time in isolation in for I encourage anybody who's been
 what time in isolation to find some way to socialize and meet ups bar on awesome way to socialize it's really engaging intellectually and you know it sounds like you're creating some of those opportunities for data Engineers are rewarding I started quote not working well worth it I hate as a software engineer in New York City and 2000 like way before they were meetups there was an email list called carries list and some others are people with remote Tech events on but now I'm with me. It's amazing and living in a place like ass off on this so much going on every night but I welcome you to check out our SF beta engineering meet up or come to data and cough we're going to have our largest Event in San Francisco yet this spring in April with over 500 on software Engineers data engineer as data scientist the people hurt curious about that field from a technical standpoint so I
 the ticket okay that sounds great tell me like it's kind of a tough business conference fatigue you know it's hard to get a lot of people to come that talk to other people in there like this business is grates the economics a really good maybe it's not it's not it doesn't scale exponential it's kills Lennie early but it's still a good business what's your sense of the economics I'm just kind of learning myself from what I hear old school conferences old school meaning you know before 2000 printed money I used to work at the bugs if Davis in the late 90s which was you know part publisher part online side part conference business so there are kind of maybe one of the last lecture
 small sort of old school media companies that put all those things together as a new school version of of some of those things about the superior internet distribution which theoretically should improve the economics economics of the conference business and the cost even more to feed people I'm quality food I'm so you know I'm I'm I'm learning to be assertive up my game in terms of event production but thankfully I have a lot of help there but you know we're able to support the company with two or three events a year and I'm support the team and I'm excited like I said it's for me it's just about buying time to continue to work with engineer's in a date away in a startup founder way I just love this community and for me to be able to live where I live and run events for
 nearest and put them together and see their eyes light up when smart people need smart people and for me to be able to create a living doing that it's not just super super rewarding and I'm super happy to be doing it now it's how I feel about the podcast it's good good business fun to talk to people such as yourself cool well thanks for coming to show I look forward to check out Davion comp I'm sure I'll do some interviews about the conference around that time hopefully I can talk to some of the speakers that are coming I've done that with a bunch of O'Reilly conferences at the scroll of the battle of your I love you Riley conferences I love and I had a good relationship with them to give giving me tickets and I've got to do some very interesting shows about topics from though so hopefully I can do that with 8-inch comp yeah I would love to do that if you want to get hooked up with any data scientist or data engineers and you doing working on his team projects
 but we definitely like people in to help you out with that and I could be cool for everyone alright

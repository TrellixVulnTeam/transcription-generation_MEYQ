Transcription: vulnerabilities exist in every computer system as a system gets bigger at the number of vulnerabilities magnifies the web is the biggest most complex computer system that we have but fortunately the steps that we can take to secure our web applications are often quite simple Jared Smith is a cyber security research scientist with Oak Ridge National Laboratory he also has a fixation with JavaScript he join me on the show to discuss web application security but I really wanted to know his position on some of the more grandiose topics that we've discussed on software engineering daily stuxnet the power grid Russian hacking corporate back doors Mirai botnet this is a wide-ranging discussion and I really enjoyed it but if you want a presentation that Jared gave that's a little more focused on web security you should check out his YouTube talk at November I'd like to it in the show notes
I really enjoy talking to Jared and I think you're going to enjoy this to

 Jared Smith is a cyber security research scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory engineering daily me about web security and of course almost everybody who is developing any kind of software today is connected to the web somehow so we were talking about web security what does that even mean is that the same as just talking about security well I think it's more of a subset of security in general when are talking about security we can mean things like computer security which is he not any device or network security or the hotness now is IIT Security on but one security is more you know you've got a no jsy Viper python nap or something and you want to protect your users against things like a sanitizing input incorrectly are I'm SQL injection are you know that more General command injection anything like that so I think web security how I think about it is any sort of web application that you're presenting to users I mean like google.com they probably have security people
 what do you want security I'm so that's that's essentially what it is but I there's obviously other domains of security you have said that there is a right way to think about web security what do you mean by that yes I think it boils down to the mindset do you have going into protecting their systems I mean attackers are going to try and come out you friend literally any way they can possibly think of but how I like to describe a and pretty much said accepted no should I have security Community when your building applications you in the building secured by default so that being said that means from the beginning or thinking about security and unfortunately people don't do that and that's all we end up with things like Yahoo breach her the link to unbreech or any of those other companies that have their passwords hacked or something like that okay so this security by Design I am definitely one of those people who builds things without a care in the world for security because I figure well if I end up having security problems that indicates that I have used
 which is like the first barrier to entry to even caring about something like security so why would somebody do security by Design to GIF if keeping your system safe requires you to even have people that are abusing the system by which shouldn't we just prioritize building something that works first I think it depends on what you're doing if you're Jeff and you're going to go build your like ad for Fry's first and you don't have any users right now get it off the ground get a dime. Store it but that being said if you're going to accept credit cards from day one you absolutely need to be thinking about security whether you have one user or a million and if that's just saying okay I'm going to interact with her API correctly and you know all my passwords with you know I'm salsa and not use something like a 95 and that's good but if your Google in your starting from scratch on the new project that they're probably thinking about him they want just because they know as soon as they launch it they're going to have a lot of
 Caesar's I'm so depends very much when you're thinking and I as a secure research research for myself and the software engineer am I can tell you a lot of projects I work on and I don't think about from the beginning but not being sense always there it's always in my mind if it's something that I think is going to have a lot of users handling sensitive data I'm going to be thinking about it absolutely and I think there is not a surly a trade-off to thinking about Security office at times yeah you can have implementation and implementation be and it's not like imitation a would take longer it would be more secure though you have Alternatives but they're not necessarily more time to write it does very much dependent what your building again I mean if you're if you're setting up a network and you're at like a sysadmin for I'm some company it very much makes sense to configure all of your logging correctly I make sure you're having a centralized logging store and make sure you have firewalls and place and it goes Way Beyond. Make sure that your users are educated about passwords and hey it's 2017 us-22 Factor off because that'll prevent
 all those other problems with people getting access to people's accounts so it's just it's a very wide spectrum and that's why it's so hard I think because people often think they know that they're doing everything but there's always something I can't forget you are unique in that you have both Infinity for security and JavaScript would put you at a particularly unique intersection of the software engineering community what is it like at that intersection what are the attacks surfaces that you are thinking about the most as somebody who is deeply involved in JavaScript and security security is like this is a great topic that and not a lot of people are that familiar with outside of the security spectrum and JavaScript is obviously this thing that's everywhere we run it on our refrigerator is now so that being sad when you think about JavaScript the fact that it runs
 client-side server I think it makes sense to go back down to the basics and things like sanitizing your input in preventing access across a script thing.. Goes a long way rather than just trying to cover every other day so you just cover your your most fundamental things like sanitizing input using correct session management if you go back in the past and look at some of the butter Billy's that companies are sometimes there is absurd as them including session tokens in the URL and so if someone gets here you are out they just have to cut that session token out and they immediately I have access to all your credit card for that site so I think it's really about things about the basics and things like Santa's again but I'm managing a sessions correctly and hey hashing passwords to the modern hashing out the 2012 LinkedIn breathe the reason that happened is because the passwords are incorrectly hash and it would have just been a few more lines of code to do it the right way so it's it's sometimes absurd but I think the basics are what we should fall back on if
 front-end engineer listening to this right now or I guess back-end engineer also cuz no does oxy back-end what are the things that a JavaScript a full stack JavaScript engineer should be thinking about the most about to get awake what are there some specific things they should keep in mind that are particularly relevant to the JavaScript world so there are a few things but I in it and I have a good time to talk I gave at no Denver this past this last November I mentioned a few Library so there's a few things that are particular job is 50 should look at them one of those things as though there's a library called helmet JSI when it's done by a really cool guy and that Jarvis of community I'm in. Essentially just adds a bunch of Hatteras your applications security protection and keep your cookies safe and other things like that and prevents access asset to some extent so there's there's libraries like that and you can go and check out that soccer this post I just did them
 yeah.. But that being said I think that we're developing a house in JavaScript on the back and it's not much different than doing it python or Java or you know Alexa or whatever it may be I'm certified again there's libraries to do all of that stuff it I think it just comes down to actually going to be thinking about those kinds of things and I found it it's actually kind of crazy going and talking to these conferences that there's a lot of people that work there places like Facebook and Google Places you think would like know what they're doing that come to a talk and I have no idea I like what I'm talking about like I thought the stuff was you know it's hot like the first day of you know that that class you took in college on security or just someone mentioned along along the line somewhere to boot camp that you should be thinking about them the right way to fill the applications yes indeed at the DIA tax services are growing in number and the educational ranks are getting less standardized
 and so I want to shift the conversation to talking more broadly about security cuz you work as a security researcher at Oakridge which is a National Laboratory I have not interviewed many people who work at this type of place I have a brother who worked at the National Institute of Health serve some perspective on the Dynamics of a research institution with some ties and to like some reliant on the government but
 pay me a picture for how a cyber security research Institution
 like how does that how does that contrast with the research that's done at a corporation or university I think that the research done at the university is pretty similar to what we do and I'm in some sense I mean we do a lot of collaboration with both the private sector and the academic world but specifically I always like to describe working at the National Laboratory where I work I'm if you have an idea and you can convince someone to pay you for it or I come in someone that's worthwhile then you can go to it you can delete a team and filled it or do it by yourself it's a very different world than the business world where I'm project sir off and motivated by a business call I mean I think that's getting a lot better and that you know it has been in certain places and Industry great like Bella has back in the day we got people that used to work there. Laboratory on we have people that built some of the fundamental particles in the internet they work with us I'm in so Bell labs in Microsoft research and and Facebook labs and Google research and all those people they get to
 lion research that's nice I tried to business goals but the same time I think it's great working right I do because we have all these agencies and companies coming to us saying hey we've got the security problem with your bike give us your best shot at fixing it for us I'm in so that's basically what we do and that damn you were still not going to be there's things were doing that aren't that the most advanced but there's things were doing that are way more than the other be able to I'm in it these days the government gets a lot of crap for you know all kinds of things so I like to point out that there's still a lot of great research going on then some like I'm right side and such

 what are some of those things that are intensive research efforts that might not proceed at a corporation University and some cents at at it depends on what the what person is coming to us asking for help or what person are going after but we have internal funding proposals where we can essentially propose ideas to the lab itself in this doesn't come from a business goal of some sponsor or some agency I'm in Bend that's pretty much open ended research so we have a project right now doing some stuff around deep learning and computer security and needs to feel tartberry security has often been at the anomaly detection does going to things just basic statistics hey can we find this event that's all of it but there's not been a lot of deep Barney dying on and it's you can look around at the security vendor space and see that everyone can I answered you and deep learning but I don't quite think it's there yet I'm so we're trying to
 things like that we have a vehicle security laboratory we have we do a lot of now our research we do a lot of static analysis so if you take some some piece of compiled we can tell you without seeing the source code exactly how it behaves and what it does do a lot of things like that and I think it's that you'd be hard-pressed to go to summer I even like Google and find it there doing the breath of the stuff that we do what is at the intersection of security in deep learning so at again like I mentioned that with a lot of security boils down to at least I just doing anomaly detection if you're looking for a user that's out of the norm on your network that shows everything boils down to anomaly detection yeah slowly I know what that's what I'm trying to say is a lot of that kind of stuff is been just just most of the most of in the past is just been hey where can I buy these basic statistical measures and see how something pops other normal but we haven't been applying things like like recurrent neural networks are convolutional neural networks there more advanced types of deer
 learning to anomaly detection and security and security domain in general how do the motivations of Oak Ridge compared to those of an essay or FBI or other government government Ali related organizations I just don't know exactly I don't know how exactly answer that but I can say that place is like an insane FBI they their goal is seeing a protect our country to protect our assets protect us going to things where is Oak Ridge we had directorates for are you know environmental science are supercomputing I mean we have the world's second fastest supercomputer that just got beat by China's I'm in China's isn't even open science but we're currently building the fastest again and which will be powered by Nvidia clusters and so we we bringing people from all over the world leave a particle accelerator other lab it breaks people from this far is Japan and China
 they come work on our projects sewing then we have this tiny little cyber security research group I'm inside the lab and we do like I said all the stuff I'll talk to you about have you thought about the conversations around the Russia hacking stuff recently the Twitter and I follow the security people depends on what actually happened that far and very and I'm not in a position to tell you whether it's true or not but I will tell you the activation is very hard on and I we will never know exactly what information you know that the agencies that were investigating a hat but it's something you either just believe in you down and you got your Merry way about it I'm in what happened happen so it's it is it is not an easy thing to etra be something like that to a country and this is something that I think he's actually really
 because there's so much acrimony around this and like the you know whether you're a fan of trump or not like one thing he says that's pretty much true is it is really hard to be like Trump says it in his trumpian language but he's like you know we can't win the computer age we don't know what's going on it's like that's kind of true like the attribution is really really hard and the kind of like have political but it's like the the way that things have been gesticulate dead by the government and interpreted by the media is that we are really sure of this and the reality is like given the public information we have not been given convincing evidence that's just simply the reality I ain't yeah if you look at the the information is provided it is very generic some of the diagram strong but the report
 I don't feel like I wish I was like are you kidding me like how patronizing are you going to be in and I think it's interesting time where the media at more or less claims that everything and technology is advancing and we got a i and literally everything companies are getting billions of dollars and DC fighting for a just claiming they do automated a eye recognition of speech or just whatever his son of Buzz words they want to string together but if you go and talk to practitioners in the spacing of software Engineers that you interviewing your researchers I mean Bill tell you that what the media says is more or less like sometimes it can be very exaggerated and the weather this case is something is is this is a case of that or not and I think it comes down to if you're a person you need to look at all the events you have and just make it a good judgment on it but I again I think it's something we can't really do much about it we're not going to know exactly what happened and you just got
 how to deal with it and shipping it like has like I've kind of woken up to around the stuff is just like I don't know if the first time I really am feeling like the meet just the end that you really the influence of the media on my own thinking like How Deeply the media affect me and and at the same time you know there's so much like the the discussion around Russia's Echo Russia's this horrible place with run by a leader who just pollutes his citizens Minds with propaganda and I'm thinking about that and I'm like thinking about the way that our media portrays things in the end like I'm not an expert on us-russia relations I'm not an expert on Russia but I just look at that and I'm like there's a there's a deep irony there to the universe reporting's of a of a propaganda driven Nation we're having these cancer
 discuss the bit anyway I mean the power Grand Inn in the power grid hacking discussion that came out it was like oh Russia's hacked are parking I was like didn't they do that like 8 years ago or like you know an end and haven't we already hacked the power grid of every other nation state out there that is connected to the internet I mean there's such a nationalistic discussion here where it's like oh as the United States we are entitled to not have our power grid hack while we go in and hack the power cords of every everywhere else it doesn't seem strange to you yeah and I in it is it is I I think that's why it's called so my my team at the national Ave is probably cyber warfare research team I'm in as much as people went to crap on the using the word cyber and everything I think it is pretty true we live in an age where nuclear power is not the most triumphant for C&R Arsenal cyber
 I need a security in general is something that is going to become ever more important and that's why I think I'm getting back to just protecting a web applications from hackers and 1/2 in your passwords just doing that using to factor out is extremely important it's not often that some attack on a nation-state or some company is a result a very complex chain of 0 days that the hackers use it's almost always just someone that compromises an email account that happens a person has privileges to everything in the network and then they can see whatever they want it is not it is not a it's not a very hard fall on this all to do as much as just educating your people on you know using to factor all that being said education is tough but I think just putting more focus on that and spend your money on that thing companies would make a big difference you mentioned the string of 0 days I was referring to stuxnet which was vulnerability that it was the result of loop holing through a bunch
 zero-day attacks and you know you and I were talking offline about this cuz I had a conversation with Sammy kamkar recently were just a little bit do you have any more insight into house because the thing that I was wondering about that I asked him about his like a did stuxnet actually changes that the narrative about sex and is like Shaq's net and Flame changed how the geopolitical steaks for cyber warfare because it later blueprint for how things could be infiltrated and hadn't how how tracks can be covered like how the you can mess with the system and then basically erase the light erase any evidence of the change no evidence there will be no evidence of the attack do you think stuxnet raise the stakes are what are the implications of stuxnet
 yeah I think when it does raise the stakes in the sense that it made people aware that those kind of things exist I'm in a few looking to pass a year as we had things like that was at the hockey team from Italy I think that's an Italian get an order at lizard Squad the people that died last what they're the ones that does Sony right and and you look at these these huge incidents that they're getting Mass coverage in the media and Associates something I stuxnet where it was awesome it was a application of unrivaled complexity there was able to take down a wet what was a nuclear plant in Iran I believe and I think Sammy mention is show how modular that was becoming abuses built on a flame and that is what really scares me is that when we start developing these components and you know it Soccer City Philippines it's really easy just ran together the pieces that need and Izzy are days that they have in the something they can do as much as bring down a nuclear plant or take down a power grid I'm we're looking at really scary times because the rest of us or just you know Bill
 react apps for our front ends are you know doing this cold data science stuff for Python and in the meantime there's some nation-state are some isolated group and the Ukraine that it's ready just to destroy our country's power infrastructure and it is not and if I do some stuff for the power grid that it's cool around a PhD student and it is not a it is a pretty physical system it is it is not that advanced we're really working on renewing a lot of the technology there but if you think ours is bad and just look at some of these other countries and in if you just if you think it's our power grid went down for the whole country power good if it went down for another 3 days we will be in the state of Anarchy people would be flipping out the whole country to be a messed up and it is a it is a very scary time and I think sucks that was one of the first things to really bring a lot of public like that and what I have heard that I think this was in discussion I had with a lacrosse who came on the show
 to discuss his book industries of the future he work in government for a while and he was saying that then the power grid conversation Russia has a bit of a positional Advantage because of how old and offline their power systems are if I recall the conversation correctly so they are essentially air-gapped is there any truth to that I'm not really that I'm not that familiar at all right I'll brushes his belt I'm and I am a little familiar with how are in the sense that you know we have I think three or four sectors of our country is gred and they're all connected and between that and it is all technology on but I think yeah I know that I'm not too full of the United States still analog and even the suffix digital it's not went out running a bunch of 1604 boxes to control switches and stuff at least my nurse and
 I'm in again you're looking at you're looking at it very 5 minutes this time because there's a lot of parties at play it's not it's not again to use like the canonical like Google or Facebook example I'm at least within those companies they got project manager is that manage the different projects and engineer is the oil filter on the same psychology but when we build something like a grid that stands you know hundreds of thousands of like nose within the United States where it looking at all these different parties coming into play in influencing House of his belt and what they're going to put in and those kinds of things I'm so down again we talked about a tax services earlier that just makes the attack surface and very very very wide and that just leaves more places for people to get high but I hope at least how it stands now is it it have to be a fairly complicated and hands on its act actually mess around with it I'm not maybe fall asleep but again we haven't seen anything of the scale of US Stocks not on our power grids or anything like that when you say that the systems are analog is that I mean
 does ended up being a feature cuz it's less hackable since we don't have you no root cats for that kind of stuff I would I don't think so but it does the older technology does help a lot and I think if you look just like I'm nuclear are nuclear launch stuff and all of the things around a nuclear Arsenal I don't know what about that either but what I do know is that it would not again running very complicated network software to control those kind of things I mean I saw that sweet that other day and Twitter that somebody was talking about it and someone was saying hey we need better technology for a nuclear arsenals another person's like a I'd be very comfortable if it would took a floppy disk just to start kind of launching some kind of nuclear device because hey we don't need some kid and some Village somewhere sending a TCP packet that sets off all of our silos to launch missiles at Russia but that sounds great to me I mean a thing by Bruce
 hey Bruce I was talking about voting systems and he was like voting systems should just be like old style paper ballots because they're too important and and then there's actually I think that's the kind of a similar well at least the system that we have is black multivariate and end it and it has been there different you know different types of voting systems throughout the country so even if they even if one voting system was hacked you know you would have to hack all the different types of voting system so you do have this heterogeneity yeah I don't know it's okay so what else have you that's very interesting the power grid that's like as important as it gets what kind of stuff are you discovering or what are you thinking about yo it with the power grid in particular yes I mean look what areas are you look at what aspects of your research tell me more about your research and I didn't mean that
 play something extra in that I am a little familiar with the research that they do have my University on that but I don't do Hands-On research myself I was in a way I can connect to the people that do that and it in again at least here I am how I seen security isn't as nearly as big of a focus in the power grid has just modernizing the grid itself and I think that is something that we do a lot where we're doing some efforts to simulate the whole grade and by simulating at can we see if we can improve Technologies like that and see how we can improve power flow I'm in another big problem within the greatest self is just how can I Supply power to the amount of people that are bringing online everyday that's a big issue as well okay well let's talk about what you said was the Hot Topic right now iot so the obvious elephant in the room is the Mirai botnet which is this Barnett that took down dying
 and Ashton Downstream from that took down Netflix and Twitter and the attack manifested because there was a large volume of cameras in coyote cameras while at all kinds of i t i o t device it I think I think mostly cameras for the cameras all had default login and username and password credentials and show their the Mirai botnet essentially scans the internet for these devices it finds ones that have the same default username and password as any device that comes out of this one Chinese company that makes these cameras and creates a giant botnet what's next in the story because we know that this attack could have been a lot worse they decide to take out dye which in the case of dying I was at the service for Life places like Twitter and get a hive in those other place
 yes I mean just imagine if they decide to go after some of some piece of our military's DNS functionality or some piece of our government's functionality again does not work for a lot more hard and then the stuff that we see in the private sector they got a lot more aftershocks were there but if that's what when we start talking about cyber warfare if they were to Target some government entity within the US and bring down maybe our communication systems that's very very bad if they were able to stop us from communicating in the case of attack and I think with i t it is it is just a it is just a crap show how much stuff is going on there and you look at CES this past week Bay I think LG release refrigerator that's not going to talk to you and I'm just thinking like holy crap why are we putting IP addresses on literally everything we have it is such a bad idea and again with the more I bought that it wasn't the only a camera as I also heard it was cable boxes and I'm thinking why do we need why do we need to have these cable boxes on the public internet
 and how does a dolphin that people's houses that have default credentials because of course people don't change their credentials like why would you do that I mean I say it why would you do that many people just don't think about it when they should but they don't and I didn't like Samy kamkar mention if companies were just to disable default credentials in the first time you logged in or set up you had to say credentials up that would solve you know a lot of those products and that way at least percent another barrier to the attackers that did the Mirai stuff I mean it showed I also I see me about this quote from Bruce schneier where Bruce was saying that the free market can't fix this do you have any thoughts on that idea like are the free market pressures enough to force the iot industry to do something about this or or not yeah I think with that and what he's missing that it does bring up a very interesting point I think it's really hard to convince companies to
 does my security in their platforms just on the basis of hey this is a good thing to do and I think that's where we stopped in to the how much regulation do we need by the government entities or just a general like Agreements are treaties even between companies saying hey we're not going to produce stuff without his core Peace Corps security features and we already see this kind of work being done at the protocols being developed by the end of the other internet standards organizations I'm I think the next steps are to get companies to think of more about this company's government at this point have these back doors into Facebook and Google and Twitter and these back roads are to varying degrees given that you work for the government or more Francis station is close to connect to the government I would love to hear your thoughts on I guess privacy basically discussion or privacy from the gutter
 Adam I mean that we alright well I'll try this conversation with Sammy B I'd love to hear what your thoughts are so Sammy had an interesting point where and I was surprised that he brought that he said that he'd more lot more or less said he has his kind of change or at least he knows what he wants but he doesn't know it's best for everybody and I think to the extent that the government needs to protect our country and our assets from you know Terrace and Insider threats and spies missing two things I think there's there's there is a amount of reasonableness to why they want to have this information but it again it can be taken too far and I think too much information or too much open this or back to his that can I take a lot of information that might not be necessary is an adventure and privacy but again I I say as a software engineer in that even a security researcher I think privacy is a huge deal
 and again it comes down to use Art Rice if you don't answer you just can't trust you if they just think like going on your site that all the information is not get down to some entity that's going to come through it and then they're not going to let me use your platform that's why I think the big reason why I like companies want that is because again they're not trust you but also Sammy mentioned that the vulnerability project he's trying to Google tracking your phone's MAC addresses and I think he even though he's got his back doors or if they do exist then they're there in these companies companies like Google and Facebook they still want to know literally every single thing about you and use it to sell more advertising dollars and all kinds of things like that I'm so it does go both ways and again even if there's not back door is that company is still going to want to have all of your personal information do you feel personally vulnerable or violated when that kind of information sharing is taking place it depends I haven't been fortunate not to have any sort of major breach of my privacy on
 I think I comes down to having good and you have practice until I'm referring to to to like Facebook or Google giving the government everything for back doors I may have a weird at any time or I'm or less okay with it if it's for the right purposes from my case I know I'm not going to say that's for everybody but I am I might my opinions hey if we're going to give all this information if a swing Google what's stopping them from getting it to anybody else we have no I did there it didn't come out of transparency they exist there is Next To None So if the government gets it they use it for some kind of purpose that is going to help a surf retired us on at the end of the day they still have all that information and they're going to get it if they want to get it
 you know there's such I mean people don't talk about this is much better there still be such a massive opportunity if the data sharing was more viewed as being more kosher by the on the part of citizens like if the government could do massive analytics that the Facebook or Google has no interest in doing like you feel a lot better about spending my tax dollars you know my tax dollars being siphoned off if I thought the government was doing like all kinds of analytics on the exhaust data that Facebook and Google were giving them to decide I don't know like what do we do with Health Care would like what should we do with the potentially basic income you know like these are these are really really really big questions and basically the way that they are often solvent government is through Superstition in like just stupid bias beliefs and I think will be awesome if they could actually hack app data to do that with we'll just think if you would if you went to some that
 average note mom that has Facebook and you tell them hey I want it to be that when you record your birthday's and tell people hey thanks for like coming to my house so that you know that get together and have my kids doing this activity if you want to tell them how you were going to give all the information the government or you know that Facebook so they can give it to people to decide what your tax at your tax bracket should be or a your how your road should be belt they're going to freak out because they're going to be like all I don't want them by the Lincoln that I'll just deal with it myself and I'll just keep dealing with the same problems I have so I think it's helpful to sit back and be like if for someone that's not familiar with technology like we are those kinds of issues really scare them and if you just talk to your parents about that I'm sure they're going to have a hugely different perspective and you and I would I mean I think that ties back in time if I could have a picture the gap between regular society and the people that are technology practitioners is growing every single day it's actually very very scary
 how much disk were there is between those two parties that is absolutely right and it is man how does it manifest in your everyday life I mean I just recently graduated from college I I me I talk to my parents a lot I have a brother that you know not not a software engineer does completely different things and just wait you just talk to your family and the kind of Life perspectives and things are very very different and so am I like him a fast do that but I'm lucky to you know I was a computer science major so I have a lot of computer science friends most people in College art some are more technologically inclined but I think again that probably has to do it to being a some kind of somewhat of a millennial being born in 1995 my life has been very different from my parents or someone born in any of the 70's or 80's and it is a very tough question that how do we how to reconcile the amount of Discord between
 the older generation are generation because we have people in Silicon Valley just Building Technology and it's just being pushed on people everywhere else and those people just kind of have to accept it they said makes a new feature that collects your camera data and they can't do anything about it but they're going to use Facebook because all their friends are on there so you know how you deal with this the technologist versus non technologist Schism feels like perhaps the biggest Schism that I've encountered in my life like I'm definitely bigger than like religious versus non religious it's everyday life like I've teenagers have conversations with people about Job displacement for example and the conversations between the conversations that technologist have around that discussion versus non technologist to just so dramatically different than them
 oh yeah is late a lot of golf's develop because of that given that you work in this government is there so many government institution do you consider yourself more as somebody who's trying to do security work that benefits the United States are you think of yourself more as a global citizen I think I think kind of eye goes both ways I think a lot a lot of the stuff we do end up being used by the government and in a lot of stuff we do it's in the ends up being licensed by some I start off or some other company I'm to be used on and it in at least in my group we didn't security sell live our stuff is stock with government agencies but if you look at some of the other director it's within our organization they're doing something with the supercomputer environmental science and those kinds of people are contributing more to the global state but I don't like to think of myself as hey I work at a time out loud I am just
 they got my cock in the wheel I like to go inside okay what am I going to do today and security that's going to benefit everyone around me because you know whatever kind of Technology we can provide to the government which food is actor on is hopefully going to help because you got some of the smartest people I know there I'm almost everyone has a PhD from some crazy school and they're all just doing this awesome stuff so we're not just thinking hey how can we belts after 6 o'clock more data about people were like how can we protect everyone not just the government from being hacked by their countries are being able to uncover security problems more easily and things like that
 continuous integration gives you faster safer software delivery with A continuous integration tool like Snap CI from thoughtworks the members of your team can push changes independently of each other and they can all see their new build running against different phases of tests before those changes make their way into production the fastest moving companies that I've talked to on software engineering daily are all using continuous integration snap CI from thoughtworks is available to anyone and if you go to snap. Co / software engineering daily you can check it out for yourself and support software engineering daily with just a few clicks I had my own continuous integration is set up for some projects that were just sitting in my GitHub account without continuous integration I got continuous integration up quite easily using snap CI if you want to be that Hero at your company that starts moving your organization towards deploy
 often more confidently towards that devops dream start working with SNAP CI at snap. Co / software engineering daily your co-workers will see you working with SNAP CI and they will fall in love with it themselves often times it takes somebody at a bigger company to go out on their own and say okay I'm going to roll out see I even though nobody else to the companies using it and maybe that Hero at the company is going to be you so check out snap. CI / software engineering daily and thanks to thought works for being a continuous sponsor software engineering daily really means a lot
 tell me more about security research what are the helpful ways of thinking about security for me has been these little principles and adages like the principle of least privilege for example if that's something that's true at every layer of the security stack and I guess another thing that's been helpful for me seeing vulnerabilities as they appear and then understanding why that vulnerabilities it's like it look at heart bleed for example and if you look at just study with what happened with Heartbleed the different things that have have to occur in order for hardly to be exploited that is a lesson in and of itself about how security works as someone who has studied security deeply in your involved in that stuff on a regular basis what are the things that have developed your way of thinking around security what are the strategies you have for thinking about security yes I think one of the biggest things that I like and I think that people that do this on a daily basis like to talk
 I'm is just I'd like to get in the head of the people that are going to come after my system so you can think like an attacker guys and you can think about how they're going to look at your system so good example as if you got just a log and field they're going to be thinking about hey how is this field how is this form implement it behind the scenes you're going to take the username the password and maybe you're going to Hash the password and check it again some other database but then if you realize hey maybe what they're doing this password is there not sanitizing it before it goes to the database so there you go right there you deal with a classic SQL injection so I can I think one thinking about how their minds that is help me a lot into being a software engineer his help so much I'm I can't describe how much I'm knowing how systems are bell and Building Systems and regular basis now so things like pentesting a sliding closet systems I'm in a lot of work I do if the lab is more security R&D I'm in more on that you know research and development side so we do less of the pen testing which I used to do a lot more that at Cisco Systems
 now we actually build things so in my in my free time sometimes I'll do bug bounties and it helps a lot just to be a software engineer on so I think it's great for the people that listen to your show most of these people already that was often seen yours so I'm I really do recommend I should go check out some bug bounties and just see if I can find stuff because it helps a lot more if you're coming from the building side and if you're coming from you and I T or C silent side cuz you can think about how systems are built when you look at a website or when you look at you know some iety interfacer router page or something like that in this psychology discussion is interested that's all you mentioned about how to build a more secure system put your self in the head of the attacker Samy kamkar is somebody who looks for exploits and he said put yourself in the hand of the head of the Builder so what you're applying there is it's just this like two sided psychology thing which I guess make sense just interesting to hear that come full circle
 I'm talking about from this side of Defending Your systems Sammy said putting yourself in the head of a builder I that's how I was talking about how it's help me to penetrate systems being a sawfish near so there are these two sides if you if your yes I'm trying to get in think about how they would have felt it how would you build something like that how is you mess up some kind of some protection things like that psychology plays a large role in Security in it it's a great feel to be in because you end up dealing with you know I'd live to spare it types of information and things you could to learn about there was a show I did awhile ago with pindrop security which is doing Bisbee security for voice like for call centers you know you call in to a bank and you know if it without a secured voice system I can masquerade as Bill Gates and take could you please transfer a billion dollars to Jeff Meyerson he's doing some podcast
 for me and because they can't verify my voice they just assume my Bill Gates been told they were talking about how you could potentially use this for like Amazon Alexa or Google home if you if Google Home East authenticate who you are or they would want to have the security layer and and the reason we have so many attacks services that are Nation these days would like voice cars drones I mean very general term but we already discussed that I think of the reason we discussed iot and we haven't really had a mainstream getting more mainstream but these things are not in Rapid deployment how how is the security industry going to keep up with all of these different attacks surfaces
 can I protect every single device and internet as they become more and more varied and I think at the end of the day again focusing to Basics is that is an important thing I think thinking about security education paraeducator developers because a lot of times the people that build their buildings applications are developers that have you know a minor amount of experience the security you're not going to get security engineers and Pen testers and researchers as the ones building of the products for you and me but I think we benefit a lot from the company is putting out a lot of these major devices like Alexa and Google home as being more battle-hardened Nest security companies and their inner core practices I'm I thinking you'd be hard-pressed to get interview with Google and not get a question about you know how do you prevent some kind of ice and addiction flyer something like that by again with that I don't think it's like I don't think I can do that tell you that the right answer that I don't think there is one but I think it's something just a bit if you can just eat people that are developing
 call you just realized security is a problem that will go a lot farther than them just completely ignoring it and and I am really really happy to come talk to you I'm on the show because I I hope people get out of this that security is not something just throw under the rug and hope nothing happens because if you if you're the one that put some fly in your system whether you get punished and not your company which I hope you don't you're going to live with for the rest of your life that you expose a sensitive data potentially millions of people so it is something just needs to be thought about more in that I'm really glad you brought Sammy and other people on the show let's talk about it and you know if the past is any indication of the future with these new systems there's just going to be these
 speed bumps over time where we're going to have car related deaths we're going to have to run related deaths we're going to have voice related spoofing and it's going to be a crazy time and the developers who leave their systems vulnerable are like you said going to have to live with perhaps somebody dying because of an issue with their system and yes Carrie times at remembering back to that. I think you interviewed him in the show I'm with a g pack if that just blew my mind with you if you have a car going 60 miles at 70 miles an hour down the highway and you're sitting at your house and you can talk to that card from the public internet and you can just shift it into reverse and they're going 70 miles an hour you are going to kill at least multiple people if not more of that get injured in the rack.
 thing that developers cannot afford to not think about the end the man like I feel like we're at a certain point where I like there is not there hasn't been much intersection between like terrorists and Packers at least as far as I know but as you have one of those in cars like that the end the you know I'm sure younger 2 ND ability to learn technology is getting more more widespread you could have a thirteen-year-old hacker who has been indoctrinated with you know radicalism and that Packer could do would be motivated to do stuff like that and would have the ability to do stuff like that it's just going to be a tremendously scary time okay what are some of the aspects of security that we have not discussed one of the things that people are not considering deeply what are the messages you would like
 to get out about security I think I one of the big things I like the thing about in a lot of my research is at UT when do I pee she is network security I think if you think about how our internet actually works if I'm a level with networking protocols like bgp which is border Gateway protocol and TCP IP and DNS and there's so many things about her abilities and those protocols to have a large impact on pretty much the entire internet infrastructure I'm just look back at the Heartbleed bug in the end as a cell that was there in the system for it like a year-and-a-half to two years before it was publicly disclose and think about all the people to discover that before then it didn't actually give you all of that existed how many let you know companies government's Nation stay actors are using the information to exploit people's servers I'm so I think thinking about for the calls himself and what their front of relays are is important because at the end of the day
 web applications are not the only medium about information gets on the internet all of those things are powered by the underlying layers of the TCP IP TCP IP stack I have a broader if we go to war with some other major nation-state like whether it's Russia or China or North Korea do you think it's going to be a purely cyberwar like a cyber War robot war do you think like are we still in age word a draft can occur and there will be actual War I know this is more like an intra did like a Diplomatic Security question but have you thought about this at all yeah I have a little bit and I and I think cyber and security Warfare in general is going to be a component of the other pieces of the puzzle I think I did pretty out of the question for a massive war to break out without there being a physical component to it at least right now as much as we like in the technology
 can you make a big deal about having robots and all these chatbots Nai that that's crazy ridiculous things we do not have bots on the ground there able to handle weapons well enough not to kill innocent people air-to-air combat friendly fire I'm so I think they'll be a physical component to it at least right now but I think cyber warfare plays Aunt like the ancillary Rolo pretzel roll too I think that would be more of a first strike on the country before we try and buy barge n then it would be something that would be just soli. Going on and I think it's a very defined territory and if you just look at the government and look into some other proposals and stuff going on there is a lot of finding a lot of research going on and more of the typical military settings on cyber warfare just because they realize it's going to be sunny it's going to be important for us to utilize in the case of sun Global catastrophe like that so it's just going to get more important and that's why I think secure is a great field because at least in my lifetime I don't think I'm ever going to be out of a job
 maybe have a job if I want to do you know it's just some kind of typical app development but there's Securities always going to be important and as much a i as you put into it there's always going to be other problems people fine with that bitter going to cry cause it to have that real people thinking about how they protect us two sons okay final question do you have any personal security precautions for everyday life that you take out the other than and I guess the obvious two-factor authentication any interesting tool do you use if you really don't want people to track you on the web and you spend the night or just look up Tor project that's a very great browser that essentially it's a complicated Scott you know how to actually worse and you should get some people to shove talk about that but it basically Master IP wherever you go so using Tor VPN is a first time but again just as simple as using a search engine like.. Go which doesn't track any of your information over Google if you're really scared about it I'm beginning Mission two-factor authentication else that's actually really bored
 encrypt your hard drives if you have a Mac and use filevault if you have a Windows computer go to get BitLocker which is Belton and some of them are like premium versions of Windows just doing things like that are important and again not only using 2 Factor off but using strong passwords I know I have a lot of family and friends are intact it will just use their name and birthdate for that I can find out on your Facebook if I go to your profile and I'll have a dictionary that my automated python schedule run against your your websites and get in with that password I'm so if you really don't want your face will be hacked and people to play slot Ray-Bans that are trying to sell to you on Facebook then you should probably start passwords but again you can find you know it doesn't focus on the things to use if I think those are some of the biggest things I'd recommend okay well Jared thank you for coming on the show and thanks for being a listener software engineer daily I really appreciate the feedback that you've given to me over the past several months and
 your talk I watch your talk on web security from November I'll put in the show notes it's a great discussion of we didn't really get into much about specific jobs for security and web security stuff but there's a ton in that talk which I really endorse so if you're interested go check it out yeah absolutely thank you for having me and if you want to see more ramblings out this just follow me on Twitter at Jared the code there cuz you know there's a bill and jerred Smithson the world's I had that special specialized there but thanks Jeff this show is been great I've been listening since like the 10th episode I think I'm so you're doing a great thing for the community Jared

Transcription: the decentralized autonomous organization or how was a digital form of venture capital it was an ambitious idea to provide a new decentralized business model for organizing corporation's on top of the aetherium blockchain few people in the crypto Community were opposed to this premise but the time line was short the code requirements were tremendous and in retrospect a vulnerability was inevitable the Dow launched in May 2016 setting the record for the largest crowdfunding event in history the following month the Dow was hacked and millions of dollars of ether were stolen the reverberations of the event were a referendum on how the aetherium community governs itself
Matt licing is a reporter for Bloomberg who is chronicled the Dow in his article the Aether Thief Matt continues to follow cryptocurrencies closely as the internet of money fractals increasingly into the public Consciousness it was a pleasure talking to him as it always is talking to the folks at Bloomberg they always give a great and accessible understanding of technical topics if you like this episode we've done many other shows about cryptocurrencies aetherium Bitcoin other cryptocurrencies I crippled you can check out our back catalogue by downloading the software engineering Daily App today we only have it for iOS but we're working on an improved back-end recommendation system or working on Android app we're working on a web front-end if you're interested in contributing to the software engineering daily ecosystem you can go to github.com software engineering daily we are focused on making an app ecosystem that works well for users of

 to build the kinds of things developers want to build today they need better tools super tools like a database that will grow is your business grows and is easy to manage that's why Amazon web services built Amazon Aurora a relational database that's compatible with my sequel or postgres Sequel and provides up to five times the performance of standard my sequel on the same Hardware Amazon Aurora from AWS can scale up to millions of transactions per minute automatically grow your storage up to 64 terabytes if need be and replicate 6 copies of your data to three different availability zones Amazon Aurora tolerates failures and even automatically fixes them and continually backs up your data to Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS fully manages at all so you don't have to if you're already using Amazon RDS for my sequel
 you can migrate to Amazon Aurora with just a few clicks so what you're getting here is up to five times better performance than my sequel with the security availability and reliability of a commercial database all at a tenth of the cost no upfront charges no commitments and you only pay for what you use checkout Aurora AWS and start imagining what you can build with Amazon Aurora from AWS that's Aurora.

 Matt licing is a reporter at Bloomberg Matt welcome to software engineering daily subjects in the cryptocurrency community I originally message you to talk about the the Dow hack and I sure don't want to get into that because your coverage of it was really good and there's just a really good piece on the Dow hack on Bloomberg I'll put in the show notes people can certainly read through it or many people probably have already read it how did you get into reporting on cryptocurrencies
 so it's a bit of a twisted tale of covered Market structure for Bloomberg news for more than 10 years when I say that's people to like what is that and it's a since it's kind of like how markets work or don't work so I started by covering derivatives exchanges back in before the financial crisis where features are traded at like to see a me group or 9 IMAX in New York or oil prices are created that led to the financial crisis when the swaps Market blew up I started covering swaps and all the reforms that came to the Dodd-Frank Act because I had a background in clearing houses and that's the way that the Congress kind of wanted to swap Market to be reformed that I started taking on sort of responsibility in the fixed-income market which is where how bonds trade corporate bonds or the US treasuries how they trade so you obviously really big huge important markets and throughout this process you know I had always heard about Bitcoin and I kind of just missed it I didn't think something that had no underlying value could actually like
 check around and it was just sort of all speculative but then sometime in 2015 and early 2015 I finally understood what blockchain was and it totally open my eyes because I realized instantly the end everything I've been covering for years it was potentially going to be disrupted and changed radically and so I just sort of went to my editor and said I need to start covering this as my beat you know nobody at Bloomberg really knew much about it at that point certainly not blockchain that they might have known about Bitcoin so in that regard I was little early to it and you know we just started started covering it and then it turned out that I had sources from my old my other world like Bike Masters who it was at JPMorgan I do I sort of knew her she became the CEO digital asset Holdings I've known day brighter for very long time since he was at icap and he was now heading up our three so it just made a lot of sense it's just all kind of clicked and I started reporting on it that was like the early
 is one Wall Street was really going crazy over the potential here for what blockchain could do it wasn't even sometimes like a proof-of-concept stage but the hype had definitely started by mid-2015 when we did a cover story for markets Magazine on Blythe Masters and digital asset today it's getting real with cryptocurrencies and it's no longer just implication the stuff is solidifying into reality and given the volume of intelligence Behind these efforts it seems almost like a foregone conclusion that there is going to be some serious disruption and I'm sure whatever degree of shock you felt when you went first clicked been 2015 I'm sure that's only Amplified in the last 2 years
 oh yeah yeah it's hard to kind of quantify it and it feels like 10 years it doesn't feel like to do what I like to tell people is is the way I think about it in a way that sort of helps keep things straight is he's got the public blockchain stuff that's happening which is Bitcoin and ethereum network and then you got the private stuff that's happening with Enterprise Solutions so like hyperledger or the Enterprise ethereum Alliance where companies like JP Morgan and IBM are designing you know Enterprise blockchains for private use for the outcome of the financial industry or Healthcare or Supply Chain management so on the public side like that stuff is out of the bag that the genie is out of the bottle and that nothing's going to stop that it's like Bitcoin has been is Unstoppable it's one of the fascinating things about it
 etherium I believe is Unstoppable it's just at an earlier stage and those those do you know that digital apps that people are going to create on top of the aetherium blockchain.. Work is going on right now and it's a lot of fascinating really interesting stuff is being done there's not much in the production stage yet but I think that's going to change in the next 12 months or so that's going forward nobody's going to stop that work on the private side it's still an open question to me why the Wall Street can get its act together and trust each other enough or have privacy safeguards in place so that you can have a private blockchain for I don't know syndicated loans or you know other the retail Market you know things that could be that haven't been updated for decades so my beat you know that I'm I'm following Finance really closely in and I find that stuff fascinating and it's still a bit up in the air in my opinion about whether we're going to see production level products coming from that side then on the other side the aetherium stuff the Bitcoin stuff that I mean that's that is our reality
 it's going to be I think it's going to be the new internet in a few years and if if it goes the way that folks wanted to go we won't even notice you know that's what they don't really want you to notice at the back-end changes they just wanted to be seamless so that's I think we're at a fascinating stage of of the development and it's kind of like an epic if you want to put it that way do you think it is is it going to replace things or is it going to just be augmentative so for example you know people invested 401 K's and the value proposition of a 401k is that this investment is going to make sense in 20 or 30 or 40 years and you look at that sort of investment thesis particularly given what 401K funds typically are investing in attic like traditional stocks and bonds and financial instruments
 making a 30 or 40 your time Horizon bet on that Financial system it to me it seems completely Preposterous but you know but but they're you just said that if it goes the way the people wanted to or not really going to notice it should you think this is a replacement system or is it is in an additive system I think it's both I think it definitely depends on what you're talking about your question reminded me of how my profession journalism just writing in general has changed the format has changed right like you don't you don't get a newspaper delivered to your driveway anymore need for information has never been greater so you're just accessing it in a different format the financial world that the same thing as I think applies here you're still going to need Investments you're still the market still needs to be there the regulator still need to be there too to keep everybody from your getting scammed and and all of that it's just you know Joe Lubin who's that consensus he talks about
 they're like it's what a Syrian the promise of it is that it puts a price on intermediators so you have a company like Uber or Airbnb who come between an apartment owner or a car owner and a renter or a passenger and they they provide a great service but they do take a cut out of that and the idea of the aetherium blockchain is smart contract basically takes the if it's now a piece of code that does everything that you ever does or the Airbnb does but the fees are are you know if they are at all like orders of magnitude smaller than the the percentage cut that either one of those companies is taking right now out of every transaction if they arranged and then the brilliant thing that in my opinion is that you see all these initial coin offering that are going out in that that's what's going to fuel these the use here so let's just call it a car coin for an Uber sort of competitor you have
 gotten by car coin to access that car digital app on the aetherium blockchain now all the other developers and all the coders who who wrote that program are going to own a ton of car coin and they're going to hope to see you go up in value and that's how they're going to get paid so it's really amazing to to shift the economics of a system that in that way so I think that's what people get really evangelico about yeah so originally I wanted to talk to you about this this Dow hacking and you want to talk to you some about that but given that this space is moving so fast and your eyes so fixated on I feel like I would be doing a disservice to the listeners if I focused entirely on this news that has kind of you know come and gone and there's lesson to take away from it I do want to talk about some of those lessons and we'll go to the Dow hack a little bit but you got things that started with a contemporary lens you know we're talking to that we were just talking before the show about Bitcoin cash and there's a lot going on that I don't
 could you maybe give us an overview I'm actually doing it a show that's going to be entirely dedicated to this subject the segregated witness you know the Bitcoin fork and kind of the different factions that are involved but I suspect that even an entire show dedicated to it won't cover all the politics won't cover all the I guess all of that the technical issues that are going on for the animosity need several several shows to contain that are professional at reporting and condensing information what are you give us an overview that we can then a springboard into more of a discussion for about what is going on what motivates Bitcoin cash to exist and perhaps you know why coinbase isn't supporting it was just another area controversy yeah sure but I'm a little out of my skis here but I can give you mine Layman's interpretation and I'm at makes two of us but I'm mostly doing is basing this on my much more expensive now
 what happened with the ethereum fork so basically the blockchain at and its Essence is a Time ordered succession of transactions that have been verified by distributed Network so that everything is ordered and if you and I if I sold you a Bitcoin 2 years ago it's back in the blockchain it's been verified it's there and so if you know I want to go sell that Bitcoin one of the things the network will do is check that you know that transaction is still valid and that you own that Bitcoin from 2 years ago now the network is is really important and then that's that's basically all the hard work hard drives around the world that are running the software that make up the backbone of safe Bitcoin and that's the blockchain when this size limit to bake came up in Bitcoin and spend several years and in you know I've been arguing about it and I'm proposing Solutions and white what came down to is you have to put a new version of the Bitcoin software out that all the all the hard drives are running and the vast majority of
 need to upgrade to that version and that's known as a fork so now what happens is that that a certain Block in a certain time the network starts running this new version of the Bitcoin software and and so if you try and imagine officially I think of a tree limb that's growing and then at the end of that tree limb you know it's it's done good and a branch starts growing out from from one from the end of that that Limb and that's the fork that's the new chain that the Bitcoin network is going to work off of and and all the transactions are going to go to that one and be verified and it's going to grow and grow and grow now if you think of that end of that tree limb there's more room there for another Branch to grow and in the kisser Bitcoin cash I think what it is if it's like ethereum which I believe is the case minors can continue they can choose not to upgrade and they can continue to use the old software so that transactions that they
 process will add to the old Network and that limb at the end what will keep growing sort of straight and you got the fork in that you got the straight so the fork here is now just noticed Bitcoin but the one that keeps going straight is no known as Bitcoin cash that's what happened in the Syrian when the fork was done and that's why we have now aetherium and aetherium classic work it's really kind of metal and weird is that I believe and I have tool transactions on each chain so if you had say 10 Bitcoin before the fork and the you now I believe after the fork you have 10 Bitcoin cash so that now is so digital currency and it has a value so you know it's kind of like you're Through the Looking-Glass here and and a lot of people who had the Syrian you know if found himself suddenly with the theorem classic and classic and Assyria
 I see you got a clone basically you you get to play in both worlds and I think the last year this is never happened and people were like you know one of the other fascinating things here is that a lot of the stuff is happening in real time in front of everybody so it's just sort of like okay that this is wow let's figure this out in front of the whole world and so when we get into the dollar store so I can tell you a little bit about you know why that was sort of a Monumental factor and what happened with the theft and everything but so basically it's just a split in the network and unless you know a hundred percent of all the users go with the new software that the old software is going to continue to operate and asking that that's going to have a kind of like a mirror chain that this is out there and then
 you have a software project that you want to build everybody does I love building products but I know more about how software fits together then how to actually write the code self I don't spend a lot of time writing code but I do like to build software that's why I use top towel. Tell us the best place to find reasonably priced extremely talented software Engineers to build your projects from scratch you can get a pair of Apple airpods when you use top towel.com SE daily to work with an engineer for at least 20 hours and I recommend it I think it's a great way to build your projects if you don't have time to build them yourself there's a misconception that Engineers have to build all of their own projects just because they're capable of doing that it's not true
 top Tahoe has only the top 3% of developers they turn away 97% of the developers that apply to work on the top tell platform and that's how you get a matching process unlike anything else I've seen in the freelancer marketplace and I've tried a lot of different freelancing platforms top talent has such high quality engineers and they listen through the design specification do you have the hand pick the perfect developer for your project and this is save me countless hours in my development process is really nothing that compares the top Talbot I have seen so you can get a free pair of Apple airpods when you try top tell at top tile.com SE daily find an engineer that's going to help you build your side project and get your MVP off the ground

 and the Bitcoin cash Fork is if I'm correct
 it's the version of Bitcoin that the preponderance of minors prefer and because there was this debate between essentially the miners and the exchanges the miners wanted a system that was more benefiting of the hardware that they had already purchased because the hardware could could mind more effectively or her or if they had more of a competitive advantage in that world and the exchanges wanted something where lightning networks or side chains allowed for faster transactions higher transaction throughput but more quote-unquote centralization where you have you know you don't necessarily need all the miners in the world to verify a given transaction you might just have this centralized trust Network verify certain buckets of transactions in my painting the right picture
 I think you are that sounds accurate but this is now I'm really sort of not I'm out of my depth but I think you're on the right track because I've seen Bitcoin cash already referred to as the first China coin meaning that so you might not know but I think it's somewhere around 60% of the mining that's done in the Bitcoin network is in stunning China and there's a huge infrastructure there with some of the hard drives in and quit minds and they a lot of times have access to subsidize electricity and so that would make sense that Bitcoin cash you know if it's my nerves are favoring that that that would kind of get that sort of nickname already
 alright okay well let's scroll back in time a little bit talk about the Dow and the lessons learned from the Dow so just to give a little bit of an intro and I'll walk to you up with kind of story of the Dow it was this crowdfunded you know one of the earlier ico's basically I think you would call that it is is this basically this this fund where people could have decentralized autonomous organizations it would enable decentralized autonomous organizations and it would be this big like a system of smart contracts or smart contract in and of itself that would enable people to set up these organizations under it and they did an Ico essentially to raise some money for it and they end up raising a whole lot more money than they anticipated and the code that was written for the for the Dow the decentralized autonomous organization was
 insource and people were looking at it and in the run-up to the actual launch of the doubt where people could start I guess transacting with it you know there was a professor who was looking at the code and he's like there's something wrong with this I'm a little concerned about it there's some bugs these might be exploitable but I guess the alarm wasn't sounded loudly enough and the Dell launched and then there was the hacking and we can get into the hacking but correct me on anything I'm wrong with in hinting us up for a discussion of this exactly right I was definitely Nico the SEC kind of waiting on this last week and said that they they did do it as a as a Securities offering and it was definitely an initial coin offering and they but they were declining to bring any charges because you know nobody associated with the doll registered as a security order went through any of those formal processes but they raised a 10 times as much
 when is Lakeside Kristoff chance who is one of the co-founders of socket who they were they were the creators of the Dow he told me he thought they may be raised 5 to 10 million and they ended up raising a hundred and fifty million of a 28 days last year he said it was the most stressful. Of his life of antenna not in the most stressful of this whole time was when the money kept rolling in because it just put this huge Target on him and the pressure is can you imagine I mean and he said he thought if it was 5 million bucks and I got hacked you know the spread out value of that probably would have been not very much for for how many people bought two again so it wouldn't it would have been a big deal but when I got 250 million that was you know that he said you know it became too big to fail the people who are pouring money into these things do you know like who they are because I suspect that this stuff is still a little too difficult to transact with fur to be Grandma I mean no no no no no
 looks like you're you're ahead of the curve here and you get in on The Ether presale or the sale of ether you know that was also an Ico it was not sure if I have the dates but it was like you know maybe a year to year-and-a-half before this or so but I believe you know it went out to people in the know for $0.05 and you know I know people who bought imagine buying $1,000 worth of it if I sent home I guess then yeah it goes up to $20 Reno right for the hack so if you're sitting on this huge pile of paper money they sent your paper value you know people just got people just got insanely Rich this is this is what I find so interesting people going to sing the return Bitcoin and then more people got insanely rich off of ether and probably some people just like totally parlayed Bitcoin into ether interest.
 $700,000 worth of digital currency in my account and this one guy told me that he just brought at the pre-sale and hasn't touched it since so you know that's that's the ether story kind of because it went from zero to you know top down and it's $400 but now it's more around 200 but still it's an incredible and it's like a three or four thousand percent increase and so yeah that's so there's nothing else to do with ether yet and did the DOW comes along and it sounds like a great idea because you're going to allow the potential users of these additional apps to vote on you know ones that they think should be funded because they think they're promising and that was the whole idea that Jen's had because like a lot of companies you know he needed to raise money for slockett which put their idea is it such a smart lock apps lock you know it reminds me of S Corp you know him from the Evil Dead to write a Smart Lock is
 Spanish controlled by at the internet of things and it's on the ethereum blockchain so if you want to rent a bike you know you and you come across one of these you can you can interact with the smart contract and you send it to meet there and it unlocks the bike for you and you do you paddle away so that's that was their idea but they needed funding and as he was going you know through the idea of like okay able to me I will sell a coin will do they know the Crabb raised like we do like everybody else is doing he said well why should everybody have to do this not very efficient you know he's a good coder he's like everybody wants to make things more efficient in their code and he thought let's just open it up for everybody and we'll have this giant pool of money and people will vote for a smart contract process on you no submissions are applications that they think are are good and then they would get funded that was at the other code was pretty simple but you know if there is untested as well as well and there were several of security deposit that were brought the light before it went live
 indeed and let's take the listeners to that moment before it when live where I think so you know your story opens and people should really read the store cuz really compelling there's a Cornell professor computer science he's sick in bed and he's concerned with the Dow at right before the day or was it right after the deadline so the Dow was have launched and the story opens 5 days before the hack so it's it's a Monday night and Cornell professor gun sirer I run call some good he's in bed with a cold but he's trading emails with one of his grad students and they're looking at the code and they they just kind of do this for fun you know they go through code and it look for bugs and they kind of just you know that's what they do
 and he's looking at it and he's like I think you know this looks like a bug here on the set of recursive call payment I think that's the technical term is basically how you I think it's it's how you act how you get your money out of the Dow
 and he notices that there's just some some problems with the the order that the code is written and this is something you just cannot make up its online 666 of of the doubt and he's like you're the bug and he sent it to his grad soon as I got there I think there's a problem in line and you know basically between Line 6 6 6 inline 6 7 and his grad student Phil Dan who's you know really sharp guy he's been looking at it and it he's just he doesn't think it's a problem and so it's kind of late and you know gun is sick and he's like okay well you know let's let's look at it like with all right let's just move on do you know nobody's paying me to do this and you know if Dave he told me later you know that they often find things that they think are huge and they turn out to be nothing right so you never know right you just don't know so they kind of go to sleep and then you know basically for 4 days later overnight
 That's Thursday people start waking up in the Western World to the to the fact that the Dow is being drained that a hacker has gotten in and has figured out a way so at this point because of the rise in the price of ether the down now holds about 250 million dollars so there's a quarter of a billion dollars sitting in this smart contract and it's got a huge back door inline 6 6 6 of the code and somebody has been planning this for weeks and they actually keep their attack and they just start it just start siphoning off handfuls of ether at a time so that the next scene is Kristoff chance who wrote code for socket he's lying on the floor of his home office taking deep breaths try not to panic because his baby is being attacked and it's in front of the entire world and there's basically nothing you can do because one of the functions of a smart contract is that once it's launched
 that's life you can't change the code it's it's immutable code is law is what you'll hear and that the whole idea here is that you take out the middleman and you you try to make it as autonomous and perfect as you can before before it goes live and and hear this one went live and the bug is there and so everybody is just freaking out and they don't know what to do and did so what did they do so this is where it gets pretty interesting of course this whole communities pretty tight-knit and the other there's a lot of brilliant coders and and hackers and folks who know their way around a line of code
 and I kept them realize right away that the whole pot of money is basically at risk and because they can't change the code what they can do is try to replicate the hack basically steal the money and keep it safe for the community before the the bad guy can steal it and make off with it so this group that came to me now they started calling themselves the robin group actually enough they start getting on Skype and and messaging around with each other some of them are in Germany some of them are in London one of them is in Rio de Janeiro and they all have different expertise in Indus different area one of them grow screen is kind of like the mayor of aetherium Bill but I call him in a story cuz he just knows everybody's a very social guy like you can't help it love graph once you've met him for like 5 Seconds he's just he's a hugger he's just a really sweet good-natured guy and so he starts interacting with everybody who's online and undoing
 interacting with the Dow and so he's out there trying to find out who to like so that he can try to pinpoint maybe okay we know who these five people are there's only 6 people interacting with a doubt maybe the attackers is 6 per person so he's on that there's there's other people who are better at coding and they're they're figuring out okay here's the back door here's how we think the hacker has done his is attacking here's how we can start getting some code together and a smart contract together too kind of erase the attacker and and try to save during the Dow for for good and then there's somebody else there there is Alex Hernandez and donut shops are on Reddit and Twitter he's done in Rio and he's like Alright somebody has to be the public face in this group so that when we start attacking they don't think it's another bad guy but it's a nice it's the good guys so he's like I can do that I can be the public face of this and
 so they all sort of start assembling together kind of like Charlie's Angels are like ocean 11 or something and you know it like the Skype messages are flying and the Dow is still being drained and it's just you know like it's a crazy I don't know 12 16 hours and I think it's worth pointing out here that this is a really strong referendum on the positivity of the aetherium community and I think this happened again with the the Ico like what a couple weeks ago or 77 million was was drained in the noble benefactor styles are basically like the response to a hack is like okay let's get all the white hat hackers together and drain the money in a way that is putting it in a safe harbor until we can redistribute safely to the people where it came from and that is like just take a step back in like think about okay these people could just steal this 77 million dollars there's not even anything really technically illegal about it and maybe
 and maybe they can prosecute or something but just the fact that their instinct is we are protecting the system and we want the system to thrive I think it's a really strong referendum on the strength of the community I totally agree with you I think and that is it it's a bit of a cliche that you hear it over and over again is that people believe in a Syrian more than in Bitcoin because they say there's more developers in a theory and there's a more there's more of a sense of community it's a more collaborative you know I'm not in those communities I couldn't say yes or no to that but I do hear that a lot and I think for this example at least that is that is pretty solid proof that there are people who have the overall Community you know that the welfare of it is important to them and they they weren't getting paid to do this you know nobody like this was not a concerted effort by any group or you know a lot of people try to blame the Assyrian Foundation or link it to them and you know that's just
 true that some of these guys have done work for the aetherium foundation but this was just them coming together on their own to try to help right this wrong and it was quite amazing and they really they were scrambling like they were they didn't know what was going to happen and so too kind of like in The Tick Tock here at some point I think around you know mid-morning that day it's not Friday like in New York the attack stops and nobody quite knows why and so he's gotten away with the attacker roughly has about 55 million dollars worth of ether in his account and end so the group is sort of like they figured out the code and the dates are pretty sure they know what to do to replicate the tag but it stops and they're they're sort of like you know now this is a question such a swirl among the group it's like holy shit are we is this legal like are we going to get in trouble
 like this this guy I mean what what's different from what we're going to do from what this person is doing and you know they don't really know and I have said to me he's like you know who pushes the button you know somebody's got to push the button and it was sort of his kind of like realize that alright I can I can push the button because he cares about the community he's the guy who helped design the ethereum wallet you know function for the for the aetherium foundation you know and that's basically how you interacted the entire network and so
 they have phones but they also you know I think at this point to what they would say is they didn't want to do it on their own but they were ready now and if the attacker came back you know that they were ready so the funniest part about this is that another sort of like you can't make this up abscess down in in Rio in his apartment and he's in the Copacabana neighborhood and they're all sort of like the they made the smart contract and they they basically have to walk the other some of the other guys in the group have to walk him through how to do it cuz it's not like his specialty so he's there in his apartment on his laptop and and they made the decision that you know there's all this money is at risk and their there they're going to try to get in there and be because what you have to do is you have to be ready to replicate the attack you don't have to launch the attack but you have to be ready to do it and so to take that initial step they are all set to go on that Friday evening after is literally like he's about to push the button
 and as router goes out
 he's just like you've got to be kidding me is basically is internet just goes down he's got enough he said he calls he calls his internet company Diamond Rio and he's like on the bike the phone with the robot voice being like we're short we detect that you think that is out in your neighborhood please be patient we are working to restore it as soon as possible you must be kidding me I'm trying to like steal this money back from this robot and I'm on the phone with another robot telling me you know to be patient and he's just like it's just too much you know so the other twist here and there are there are just so many twists in this story is that you only have so much time to get in to launch your sort of initial attack and basically because his internet goes down that they missed the window so now it's like they're done they can't do anything and they all kind of feel really defeated abscess said to me you know I felt like I was going to kind of we were going to come in and rescue you know Save the Day
 and then basically where the where the worst hackers in history is not drain they did not have time to let smart contract is there is only a certain amount of time when you can get into this this Escape pod is what we call in the story to to like and they missed it so if you're not so why they had to resort to a fork or one of the reasons I guess there's more twists and turns so that they miss their initial attempt to do it they couldn't get together the next day they had family commitments and everybody was sort of scattered around the world but then that's the next Sunday they got together and they are the ready to go and they launched like so to help your listeners like the doubt think of it as a spaceship and how are these guys thought about it like a spaceship is like the alien spaceship you know an alien and it's got the self-destruct sequence and if you want to get your money out you have to get into it and Escape pod and
 and you have to like ask it to to to get your money out and to take the two smart contract in it and it puts it takes your money and it puts it in something called the child down so it's a sub account it's not out of the Dow but and it's in a child down and this was the the back door that the hacker used was in this functionality so to to replicate the hacker white hats the Robin Hood group had to be in one of those child Dow's you have to ask it to initiate a child out I think it's like 7 days it takes 7 days for you to do it so and then it's like the clocks are ticking and if you're not ready and in it when it closes then you're not you're still in the Dow you're not outside in a child out count
 so they had to wait for another like opportunity to get into one of the ongoing child dowse and eventually did so now they're ready to go they're sort of in place but again the qualms set in and they don't want to break the law they don't want to do it if it doesn't have to be done so they're just kind of sitting there and then a few days later okay maybe he gave up right right maybe you gave up maybe he's making a point maybe the contract broke because what what it's doing is telling it out to take my money out and give it to me and that the bug that he exploited was that it allowed him to do that over and over and over again so even if you only had say you know $100 worth of ether in the Dow you could withdraw that $100 over and over until you had in a thousand or 10000 ether and and so that's how he was able to to to get all the money out but apparently
 kind of that intensity on the smart contract can can break it at a certain point so they weren't sure if that's what happened or if he stopped on purpose but in any case a couple days later once the white hot guys are ready to go the bad guy comes back and he starts training the down so now they're ready to go and they basically all get together and they launch the launch the counter and they start draining you know so the best way to think about it is at this point the beginning there's about 12 million ether inside the Dow and that's how you get the value of it and the value of ether of course fluctuates the attacker had drained about 30% of of that 12 million so he had you know some point to yeah so so he's got that are 70% remaining and that's basically the race is between the white hats in the black cat to get that 70%
 so they kind of pill from there and then let's the help of the Community Thrift goes out and after they go out to like people they know who have a ton of ether in the Dow and they ask them like a man I need all of your ether if you don't mind to help you know like drain the Dow and an amazingly people like yeah I hear you go and so because because they had like now that I don't know like let's just make up a number 10 times as much ether at their disposal versus the the black guy that they could drain the Dow much more efficiently and quickly so basically they won the race and at the end of the day the white hats had the 70% secure and the black hat had the 30% secure so now this is all maybe within a week of the attack right so this is all very frenetic very frantic so they're doing this you know sort of behind the scenes at this point definitely behind the scenes I think they made some
 Overture C note on Twitter and on on some some other you no slack channels and things to let people know that they were good guys they weren't stealing that they were doing this to protect it but you're definitely behind the scenes because they were worried about the legal consequences then on the other side you know you have the whole rest of the community be like oh my God what is what are we going to do everybody starts talking about how to fix this through the blockchain and that's where we we come to this sort of debate about a soft fork and hard fork and the folks like vitalik buterin who invented the theory are very involved if there's a huge debate that begins people in the Bitcoin World start trying again because you know it's a lot of them you can't change the software the blockchain is immutable that's like that's the whole point and and so this whole debate starts getting going and it's rather fascinating and that's what that's what's going to get us to the Hartford decision

 okay and it's a real quick if the difference with a hard-working ass off work is that you make a hard Fork you're saying that this new version of the blockchain is not compatible with old software version of the blockchain everybody you know you're either on the bus or off the bus soft work you're making a new you're making for cat that is back compatible so I guess who the hard for your invalidating some percentage of the original blockchain not quite exactly was that they were going to Blacklist the aetherium that have been stolen and they were going to try to you know the idea was like okay we'll come up with a system that will not allow that etherium to be so how old are moved anytime it does you know we'll be alerted and and we'll we'll do it that way and not to get into the details but that they just people realize that that was too difficult to maintain
 sorry I kind of came and went as an idea so the next idea was you know the hard fork and rather than like at this point just watching is growing of course there's some people were using the aetherium blockchain so transactions are being added you can't invalidate all of those transactions that was just the impossible in and it really bad precedent so hard Fork basically what it was was they were going to redesign the code of the Dow to Simply do one thing if you had money if you had invest in the Dow you are not going to be able to get your money out so they were they was launched that smart contract on a block that is in a certain number of blocks down the change from where the original. Was it would like back the Dow and in any interactions with a doubt I would Now work on this new contract that is just basically come get your money out and to do that they had to convince the entire network running aetherium to to upgrade to that
 version of the software that had this one change in it so I was confused by the two of you you can't go back and change the history of the blockchain or all those are invalid it all those transactions that have happened in the meantime because we're talking about a month between doing the hack occurred in June and when the hard Fork was implemented in July of 2016 so let's hope that's a lot of transactions and it's like you went back just wipe that out everybody be like screw you I'm out of here this morning this is for amateurs right so that's the nuts and bolts of it is still is really kind of contentious you know when people like there's a lot of heated debate as you seen in the Bitcoin block size limit debate people take this really seriously and to get emotional and I'm in a lot of people have their lives invested into it and it was just you know a lot of back and forth but at the end of the day the community that like they put out the update and the vast majority of of notes running the ethereum blockchain upgraded to that version it was something no more
 99% and everybody celebrated you know that they had some champagne and they let you know people were like alright this is great we've done it and it basically invalidated everything the attacker had done because of another clerk in the way the Dow was designed and so the way I thought about it in the story was that you know on the one hand corsage chance you know he wrote he write a big bug annoyingly into the code that allow the attack to happen but on the other hand the way he wrote the Dow allowed it to be saved because when you initiate a child down when you basically for whatever reason you said I want out and asked to do that in it and it took 7 days and then the money that you had would be moved to the child Dow and you had to wait for 30 yes maybe it's 27 days for 28 days
 to get that money out so there's a song Waiting. You know more than 4 weeks so basically that the attacker he robbed the Dow but it was like he had to kind of sit there at the curb by the bank and I would his bags of cash waiting for his getaway car to show up you know for weeks later and so by doing the hard fork in between the that time but when he could have made off of his money they basically stole it back and now the attacker had had nothing to show for his effort and that was you know I think that was a big reason that the community wanted to go along with this was because it it really just sort of like they hacked the hacker so is so as I said earlier in the show what's a hard work okay well it's meant to put the chain in a certain direction with a change to the underlying code right through an update but that doesn't stop people from not
 choosing the update and end still working off of The Originals version of the software so in this is not now we're back in July of 2016 and I think Bitcoin had done a little a few things like this but nothing is as major and nothing as as publicize so the first time that the guys like Absa and an amen and a gun and Chris are chances are all watching us and you see the hard fork and its at Edison dhakad by more than 99% of the nodes running on aetherium but there's this little it's just a little sliver that didn't and they're like wow why isn't 100% we don't understand so they're just not scratching their heads then they start to notice that the miners are working off the old chain and by the old chain I mean that that's the that's the original chain that's etherium the fork is it is well I'm sorry that's that becomes ethereum classic the old chain with that still has the Dow attack in it has a history of that chain has the Dow attack and so people are just like wow okay this
 sounds kind of wild and where until like the 4th Dimension here and people start building on that chain and and pretty soon you know there's a lot of reasons why people say that they at want to support at some of them are you know people from the Bitcoin Community who don't like ideologically believe in Forks I'm so they are there just like this is the true history of the blockchain we're going to support it and other people I think see an opportunity to get in at the very early stage of the Syrian classic you know which of course basically starts at zero but soon as the value and it goes up $2 to Dollars you know so they watched Bitcoin Rising price they watched aetherium Verizon price and I think there's just some people who want to jump in
 so what's happened is now you've got aetherium classic and as I said on that chain the Dow attack still lives so the attacker now has 30% of his attack it's just not an ether name or it's in the theorem classic and the white hats have that 70% not in either but in ethereum classic
 so basically to kind of make a long story short through all of this the white hats sort of like they didn't really pay attention or are they chose not to really kind of continue to go after the attacker on the ethereum classic chain and this is this is what they refer to as the Dow Wars because what it is is you have to constantly be watching for the attacker to be trying to get out in his child out and then and then move the money and you have to follow him and attack him and and try to like stop him from doing it to the he has to do it again and again and again and it just was going in perpetuity and I think because you know the folks who were the white hat in the white hat group had saved all of the actual ether you know in the original attack or they had save 70% and then the hard Fork head-to-head returned it to 100% they're like you know that's good enough
 the value that the hacker ended up getting was the money from etherium classic that was created just like I'm here I'm sure he couldn't have seen that coming he or she couldn't have seen that coming. That's where the vast majority is value came from mr. Fork yes it's it's the entire value of stopped at that's where yeah so that's you know one of the final and craziest West is that the solution to to restoring The Ether led to the thief you know having some of his money are having the value again in Syrian classic
 so I think it's worth taking stuff back here and saying this is pretty good proof in the whole thesis of like fiat currency is just what you make of it like you can invent a currency today and say this piece of cardboard is worth $18 and if people believe you then it's worth $18 in money is just money is an illusion and we can just we can sit we can invent money and as long as we come to a consensus around the fact that this is worth it or enough people come to a consensus that this is worth some amount of money that we can convert this into Dollars which by the way started in this kind of in the same way that's a currency
 yeah besides all the technical kind of fascinating aspects to it and the social classes that there's a real. Go aspect to all of this as well let you know that the theory of money and yeah it's just a mind-bender you can just kind of go deeper and deeper and deeper into the story or just into the implications of this story and it's definitely not something that's just sort of than an artifact that happened last year were seeing it with the Bitcoin Fork now and I mean I don't think anybody like if you would ask time do you think Satoshi Nakamoto thought that there would be a Bitcoin cash I kind of doubt it yeah okay so let's let's now go there cuz let's talk about how this episode The Dow hack
 glad to disappear in classic and etherium normal aetherium and there were people who were poo-pooing that and I should point out so I was doing shows about Bitcoin and blockchain and aetherium a year-and-a-half ago when is cerium launched I guess that's what I was about 2 years ago almost 2 years of this point and there were Bitcoin maximalist even back then and they were telling me that the area was just going to end in disaster this thing is too ambitious they're totally crazy they don't know what they're doing I got to admit I was actually a little bit suede buy them like I ended up doing a show called aetherium skepticism where I was basically like okay what we know what's all the reasons to be skeptical of aetherium and you know what tense in here in communities try not to be so strong and stand so intelligent now I'm a lot more open-minded about this stuff and why don't you frame the ideology that's that's being represented so
 strongly in and angrily and all the animosity is going on today frame that in terms of the aetherium fork sure I think there was a lot of people's experiences back in that time frame you know whether if they could survive this debate was definitely helping question I think that that was something that you had to sort of take seriously what I find interesting about it is that frame of the argument is allowing the Bitcoin Community to define the aetherium community and I don't I don't think you know I certainly don't think it's hearing Community thinks that that's how it should work and I don't think I've spoken to be mailed with metallic and he's told me that the the sort of immutable type of watching that's that has been built around what is not he's not interested in it he's interested in and making something that works and you know if and when the
 Network needs to be tweaked or or changed their open to it and it's not it's it's kind of not a big deal today though I think the core guys in aetherium at the way that it is a big deal to the the people who are in a quart camp on the Bitcoin blockchain so it's just a sort of ideological difference you know and I think one persuasive thing that's been said to me by more than one person is in the business world do you really want to get involved in something that can't be changed and I'm 6 are made like transactions go bad and if you can't go back in an audit and change the history of your business that's kind of like why I don't think that sounds great so something that that does have more flexibility while coming from the story of Hardcore cryptoworld sounds like a betrayal I think in the more mainstream World sounds like kind of like something you'd want enough and a feature not a bug okay
 Bitcoin cash versus regular Bitcoin this is something that is like happening right now as we speak and coinbase put out something coinbase is the the biggest exchange of cryptocurrencies biggest safest and tons of people have Bitcoins sitting on coinbase and coinbase said we're not going to support Bitcoin cash so we've already addressed this idea that know if you're with etherium and aetherium classic what happened was okay if this work occurred and you got money and both of these places so the money in etherium classic like we had was quite material and this was money that allowed to hackert actually benefit from hacking the Dow
 and coinbase basically said look we don't care that you have x million dollars in in Bitcoin while though I don't they did say we don't care but they said we're not going to support it so where as you know if you know that this worker card is for this work did occur between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash everybody should you know you know for taking the lessons of the aetherium fork to be the standard you should get a copy of your currency in both of the forks so why wouldn't I have so much trouble like why wouldn't coinbase support that why wouldn't coinbase give you as much Bitcoin cash as you get in Bitcoin
 that is a good question and I don't feel like I want to answer for coinbase I think I think tomorrow so I will get the I will get the answer to that question cuz I forget things that I see on Twitter and then you know cuz there's so much and then it comes back up I'm just bubble up hold up into my mind what you have to do to list a new asset on an exchange like coinbase or Gemini that you have to go to every state where you are regulated because they're regulated as money transfer agents and you have to apply to them to say okay I have a new I have a new asset it's called Bitcoin cash and I want to I want to list it on my exchange so I believe it's not maybe coinbase you know to the messaging as well as they could have but it's not something like they just flip a switch and now all of a sudden you you have Bitcoin cash stuff that that might be part of the answer here and
 so yeah I'm going to I'm going to front of myself a little bit but a story I'm working on is you know when you deal with coinbase your transactions don't touch the blockchain you're dealing with coinbase as account and a bunch of cash and internal count in a bunch of ether and a bunch of Litecoin and when you go there and you say alright I want to buy a hundred Bitcoin there like okay where's your cash okay there it is in your account and now I'm going to take the cash from your account and I'm going to take the Bitcoin for my account and I'm going to swap them they're not even a side chain they are like I don't think because I don't know if she'll see if there's some link to the actual box Jam but there isn't so that controls all right you want to have your hundred that you just bought from coinbase on the box and you need to move it out of coinbase on to your wallet that does it does have a address and not
 people know that and I think as as this good becomes more popular and the price goes up and people get it's more attention we feel like you know that Bloomberg like it's part of our job to educate folks that you know this is how this is how to stuff works like everybody kind of if you want to know how the New York Stock Exchange works you can find I don't know how many books on it but you know at this point how coinbase works is sort of like you know it's at their security I don't mean to say anything about any update they're all of my accounts have very good security but it's it's a developing kind of situation in a developing on there action write so when you're buying something on my coinbase you're not actually buying the cryptocurrency ass at your essentially buying an asset that is pegged to the value of Bitcoin but it's not actually Bitcoin chat that way it is Bitcoin it's just not in your possession
 one of the roles the exchanges play is also a custodian so you now have bought your Bitcoin but coinbase unless you take it out of coinbase and put it in your wallet they're acting as a custodian for it so I actually own the fit you know own the Bitcoin that that you purchased so if you feel that's something you don't like to do you know you need to take it out and put it in your wallet and then it's under your own personal control a lot of people feel just for convenience sake they leave it with coinbase or maybe they don't know that this is how it works you know I don't really know I bet I tell you I was reporting on this for 2 years and I just learned that a couple weeks ago and it surprised me
 okay so that you can really generous with your time I want to go a little bit further but I will be respectful of your time will wrap up soon but I wanted to ask you just a little bit about what it's like reporting these days and what it's like being at Bloomberg cuz it feels like the new cycle has just like change I don't know something happened with the with the presidency presidential election where you know I guess it made everybody's hair stand up on end it made Twitter a whole lot better like to have doing just in terms of like the quality and the the velocity of information is coming on and I've interviewed your colleagues bradstone and was at Chapman about the varying topic since just I just always love talking to reporters because they're so good at putting a a verbal flourish to the technical topics that I cover in in in technical detail but maybe you could just tell me what it's like being a reporter in 2017
 in and out your perspective on the news and perhaps what it's like to work at Bloomberg thank you Jeff for this is been really really fun and I really appreciate your interest in the store in just a space in general services this is our has flown by yeah you know you're absolutely right it's the the pace of like every week I just laugh because somebody's like that was a crazy weekend crypto right it's like every week it's a crazy week we're only on Wednesday here and you know we've already got the fork in Bitcoin cash and God knows what's going to happen next so it is really hard to keep up with that we recently expanded the number of reporters we have you cover this just because we're getting more and more interest from Bloomberg subscribers on the terminal for any info on me know what's going on with these two additional assets and then the underlined blockchain sort of Revolution or whatever you want to call it it see how it drives web traffic like crazy you know it's Twitter like loves this stuff
 suggest it's the fuel you know that sort of makes it all go and so the challenge is you know like in the Ico craze how do we possibly know what's a good I see on what's a bat Ico we're not necessarily trained to read through white papers and figure out that this is like sounds good or doesn't so we've taken too much more General like thirty thousand foot view on ico's we're just like this is you know this is going crazy they're raising more money than Venture capitalists and sort of not tried to piss whether we like it or not you know when you're right about something that puts the sort of imprimatur on it and it did kind of legitimize a certain things so you know we want to be careful with the Bloomberg reputation to do our due diligence and interest two solid reporting that were known for but when things move too fast and it becomes witches what's a real Challenge and I think you know
 it's a rarity kind of in this world where you knew that like OK August 1st was coming and there's going to be the vote you know for Bitcoin and and it's like so we can prepare for it the Bitcoin cash stuff that's what like you kind of sort of have to be more ready to go on the Fly and just sort of roll with it because I don't know nobody was talking about that a couple months ago it just sort of you know suddenly popped up a few like a week or two ago I think and so
 it's fascinating and it's kind of like I think it helps for an organization like Bloomberg to have folks like my colleagues Lily cats are Camila Russo who are bike day today they're like they're blasting out really great spot news stories on what's going on prices the volatility and then I'm more of like okay what's the big picture stuff how do we how do we do a smart story on you know what's going on and What needs more deeper reporting so we can kind of hit it from both sides but you really I mean to stay up on this you need you need to be on Reddit you need to be watching coinbase are going to ask I know you need to be watching Forbes you know there's just a lot of great outlets for many different aspects you know there's lotion has a great pot gastonis Unchained so I think it's there's just it's a fire hose right now and any reporter or news organization I think would feel stupid trying to own it and we just all have to do
 what would you best and hopefully you know it's up to the readers and listeners out there to just sort of put together a menu so that they can get this what is holistic a picture as they can be described in one of the things I asked him and this is obviously coming from my biased perspective cuz I run software engineering daily with with one of the person Erica helps me out a ton but it's not a news organization is it it's like not it's not Bloomberg stop in New York Times and I was talking to Brad Stoner bad I was like you know it's kind of nice doing what I do because I get to own my own destiny and I have to answer to anybody you know I kind of make my own deadlines I get to you know handle the I get the uncapped upside of my own business in my own reporting this is why I said I was like you know your bradstone why don't you just like open a patreon account and become like the bradstone channel and you could like make a really good living just as Brad Stowe
 or just write books all the time like why not why are you spending your time getting your upside capped by working for a large organization that that takes you know the upside beyond your salary and whatever stock they give you and now I'm starting to understand because you can do things at a large news organization that you simply cannot do and like you said there's the imprimatur your words are going to not just have the the impact of mad by saying it's Matt licing X Bloomberg with all of the the reputation that comes with Bloomberg interesting you know a place where we are at today with news where and you know talk about centralization right like I would argue you can't
 you don't want a a news ecosystem where everybody is just individual reporters and you have to go out and figure out like which of these reporters do I trust it helps to have centralized Outlets that have internal vetting process ease and that's why I like I mean when I look at that kind of centralization I think the same kind of centralization is needed on the blockchain which is why I'm a fan of the side chain lightning Network story but do you know that's certainly a different show me a different episode so anyway it's been great talking to you I appreciate you coming to show you so much this is been really really fun

Transcription: ransomware and DDOS attacks happen all the time sometimes they affect large swaths of users Wanna Cry ransomware froze the computer systems in hospitals in the UK the Mirai botnet DDOS attacks took down a DNS provider making Netflix and Twitter and accessible for a short. Of time these are innocent attacks compared to what we could face from a world where cars and heart rate monitors and other safety-critical Machinery become connected to the internet by default this is not a new subject we covered it in previous episodes about security but it's a deep subject and there is much ground to cover Chris Craig Jones The Show for this episode he is a security researcher at Oak Ridge National Lab he said he's Network and Cloud security and in this episode he brings his broad expertise to subjects like iot security car security and the question of State
what do we need to standardize and certify as the internet becomes connected to physical infrastructure thanks to Jared Smith for the introduction to Chris
 the process of troubleshooting bugs can be tedious and inefficient for developers especially if they push more and more CO2 production The Unlucky developer assigned to bug Duty make it bombarded with error alerts and spend hours figuring out which errors to address first they might have to deal with logs to piece together what happened or even spend time reaching out to other Engineers on their team for help bugsnag improves the task of troubleshooting errors by making it more enjoyable and less time consuming for example when an error occurs your team can get notified via slack see the diagnostic information on the error and identify the developer who committed the code plug snacks integration with jira and other collaboration tools makes it easy to assign and track bugs as they're fixed we have a special offer for software engineering daily listeners try all the features free for 60 days

 Chris Craig is a security researcher at Oak Ridge National Lab Chris welcome software engineering daily variety of topics around security and I'm sure they will win together but I know you have a lot of different areas that you that you are familiar with so I'm hoping we can get you a variety of them and I want to start with the topic of cars why is vehicle security vehicle computer security an important topic today I think in light of Charlie Miller and Chris valasek making the cheap Pack very popular I think everyone's concerned with their cars you know I especially in America I just came back to the UK where it's a concern but not you know they have plenty of public transit but I think everyone's really concerned for the safety of these vehicles now that hacking is becoming far more of a of a household term right or at least the computer security is becoming a concern for just the the average
 everyday consumer so I think specifically vehicle security is new because people perceive their cars is this giant black box that just you know you put your key in it you put some gas in it and it goes but they're kind of unaware of a lot of the technology going on behind the scenes that's been steadily improving and kind of built upon a trust platform that is I think the best way to say is dwindling especially as people are beginning to test in have Prada various aspects of these kind of really nicely built embedded devices and they're starting to poke at it and realize that these were built with trust in mind and that's not entirely the the current kind of world now so give an overview of the computer systems in a typical car and some of the vulnerabilities that are just on the surface of those computer systems so I can leave really speak
 if you hadn't Craig Smith on who is the dude he's the guy and I respect him greatly I think I spoke with him actually a conference via but the I can only speak out of my personal experience and I'm I come from a penetration testing background so I can only kind of poke it regular I can only see the things I poked I forgot so your car is actually fairly noisy especially when it's going down the road there are various aspects of it in place which is your head unit for example it can have anything from a USB stick to a CD drive to Bluetooth and all of these could be feasible attack factors in fact I believe some cars even have their own built-in browsers and if they actually do have their own piano for surfing the web so you can connect to a wireless hotspot via your and I'm sitting front of a Starbucks connect to the local Starbucks the surf the web from your own car and the and the entertainment unit but you could also visited malicious website from your car and I doubt your car
 where is running it updated version of Firefox or Chrome or some other very robust browser so these are these are all kind of more surface-level attack or if sorry very common attack surfaces at least to get started if you really want to get Nuance there is the OBD2 port which is kind of reached infamy at this point at least in the vehicle security around because everyone wants a remote attack but the OBD2 port is surprisingly noisy and it's a great way to get a lot of control in a car that isn't necessarily designed for it if you and I guess I'm not entirely sure we know where the OBD2 for it is you know where you go to typically get your vehicle serviced or if there's a check engine light and there's that little kind of socket that's right underneath your steering wheel yeah you can just plug into that and it's screaming information all the time and people can either use that to inject lights
 certain messages where they can use that to just read certain messages to kind of get a diagnostic of what your car is doing there's other things like the tire pressure TPM stuff as well as also another possible to affect your butt does attack sir for the texts are a little Advanced nightmare attack what are the and how the in terms of how they would manifest I know that some of these were Illustrated in that wired article in the video that went along with it is quite famous but maybe you could just describe some of these for people who aren't familiar or if there have been some new attack vectors around the idea of a connected car that have a rose since that is his neck is kind of made its way into the mainstream okay so as far as head of the nightmare scenario is you press your brakes and they don't work or you turn your steering wheel and it doesn't comply those things are
 I don't want to be careful here because Jeep is made a lot of changes since that Vista and you can take one brief look at the stock price around 2005 all of the new innovations that they came out with sense so these attack vectors are not as, at least the idea of a remote like I remotely connected car start starting to be something that's kind of dialed back but that doesn't mean that your car isn't as finally or isn't as well connected internally so or that it doesn't want to call out so two things that I kind of think of that come to mind are you know when I mercenari was one that we actually tried you may be familiar with I don't want to specifically name names are not sure where your brand thing but there are certain insurance companies that are incentivizing safe driving programs and they can use data mining on your OBD2 port and they can basically read the can messages sent from your car they can kind of profile your car in particular
 I'm using the OBD2 port cuz it it's sending anything from the degree of your turn to how frequently you you break 2-1 you turn on your lights during the time of day all of that information can be derived and date of mine from your Canon from your Ken information from your OBD2 port so they use that drive safe driving but if you could which I think and want to talk scenario we actually to try it at our lab you can kind of just fuzz messages basically sending random garbage to the port and we are fortunate enough to have a vehicle app where we can test this aspect while driving so we actually have the car but like 40 miles an hour and then we tried injecting kind of putting in one of these fake sensors to inject just random can messages and it was a hybrid car and I think it told itself that the battery was off and then it started to accelerate wildly oh my God I actually had shut itself off so and that's
 leaving a controlled attack that's not even something that is you know a very targeted payload and I know Chris and Charlie made it look simple but they actually spent 3 months reverse engineering the reverse engineering aspects of be the head unit to make sure that they can inject something from the head unit to the can bust but if you can have Direct Control you can just send garbage in and apparently get some interesting results but as far as modern ones the ones that make me might make my ears perk up or instances like you know where your car has a browser in it it means that any website you visit has the potential specially with things that grow Hammer which is a the modern kind of level attack that is a read-only attack but you can read at specs of your memory and it can change bits you can kind of pull that out to websites that websites can modify aspects of your of your computer and so you have websites that you can that can modify aspects of your car kind of remotely and all this from just doing a browser inside of your
 so why is my browser sandbox properly I think it's because a lot of that's actually see you bring about a very good good question which is that I thought all this was sandbox why is my head unit you know talking to my car why does my head unit know about my brakes you know why are these two directly communicating to one another why are they called off and I think I can't speak for vehicle manufacturers of course but I can tell you what I've seen and that is that it does not appear to have been a thought I don't think I think Engineers from a lot of vehicle manufacturers Just wanted to inform you and the fastest you know they wanted to inform you that you're going the speed that your tire pressures at this much and that you know you if you want your Bluetooth connected phone to immediately connect to the first phone at Seas of the first phone it remembers that looks similarly these are all features and they want to provide features and better cars for consumers and
 a lot of times these things aren't done without you know Security in mind without proper kind of authorization and stuff like that so that's why I think a lot of the times then there really wasn't a wallet present and it's very difficult to update I mean test was a great example of being able to just roll out features and update your car but not everyone has it built that way and so you know implementing something like that now is difficult very difficult and I can't I think right now the solution is just buy a better car 5 to 10 years later song
 what's being done right now to standardize car security is anything being done I think there's I definitely see an effort towards at the very least for new vehicles the other seem to be to push his kind of My Mind One is kind of Walling off everything separating the head unit from the rest of the can-bus making sure that the head unit can't see any of this stuff which kind of walls off the the highest attack Vector right like everyone everyone uses your head unit even the person in the passenger seat and you know uses your head like in somewhere I think you feel with your radio so far there's been a there's been an increased effort as far as like Walling that stuff off but there's also
 policymakers that are trying to well that's more in the realm of safety there they're also certain policies that are that are kind of in place like vehicle-to-vehicle communication and vehicle-to-infrastructure stuff that's being slowly rolled out but I believe it's going to Bear some fruit and the upcoming years like probably 5 to 10 years where your cars were talking to other cars and trying to kind of be safe along the road but I think you're going to create another problem by solving a problem in that case I want to switch the topic to talk about ransomware we can come back to cars a little bit later ransomware is something that I was just not aware of it as something that was going to be a big deal until it was a big deal it is a big deal what are your Reflections on the series of mainstream ransomware attacks attacks made it to the public Consciousness what are your Reflections on these that then take place
 last several months I think the biggest one is why I cry right like that's the one that actually got everyone's attention and the funniest thing about it and I say funny from a us a place of dark humor many penetration testers have that kind of that they laugh at that shine Friday if they laugh at the misery of like you know the IT person or the programmer having to fix the bug but I think it's kind of funny is one of the best solutions for it is to update your system it's a great way but just keep your version of Windows up to date and it actually has preventions in place to stop you from clicking you know
 Wanna Cry. Exe which I have I buy just because that's typically the injection Vector but it's proliferation is actually the worm aspect of it is the scariest thing I guess to answer your question directly it feels like an in the reason it's I think the most important thing about it is the fact that it's not just Grandma clicking a bad email attachment wannacry actually had a Windows phone ability that was kind of looking better than it and it use it to warm its way across internal networks so that means that it can not only jump between the outside of an infected one host affecting you know your subnet and that I like you you're seeing like you know worms which is kind of a type of attack that hasn't really been a popular outside of my email worms in the 90s and stuff like that like it's it's it's it's kind of weird to see it again but it also reminds you just had treacherous it is and ransomware itself is bad because
 so cheap you know it's really it's really easy to implement but it's really easy to modify then throw right back out in the wild yeah you know people are people so you do what you can but I think it just I think they at least the preventions for wannacry is yeah I just keep yourself up-to-date and and it's very important to do so and it's a hard problem for larger infrastructures but you got to do it you know you got to do it to survive and keep your infrastructure alive at this point I was watching wannacry sort of closely when it came out of so you know this all is public pictures of people getting their electronic Billboards shut down with ransomware or kind of lying and dystopian my attention flag little bit when the pet you the respect you and then not pet
 yeah these other things I think we're ransomware I remember seeing me is you know where the top of Hacker News and I just I didn't have time to look read about them around them but that were these with these linked or was this just sort of like a side effect of Wanna Cry being you know I attack that really made its way into the mainstream in the to everybody's I was on was on ransomware and then you know so coincidental 80s these other maybe you know less irregular attacks ransomware attacks just got more news because of that collateral from Wanna Cry with the patio in the attacks I honestly don't know this is Sally something I'm kind of what kind of weak on a mutation is a huge part of signature detection in trying to prevent further attacks down the road but I'm not as familiar with patio as I am I want to cry and kind of the more the more mainstream ones

 so what about the subject of attribution so trying to sort out where these attacks come from a ransomware attack is a lot different than a directed Cyber attack at you know it and stayed actor but in any case the subject of attack attribution this is something is piqued my interest for a while and we're about to do a series of shows about it cuz there was this big study that came out of the Rand Corporation and I emailed a couple guys from there so I think we're going to do some shows about that but why don't you explain you know from your discussions with people and movie at Oakridge or at conferences why is attribution so hard and why is it so important you got to know who attacked you at some point and it's always a challenging subject because you could always feel like you can always do you locate some aspect of your IP but it's a difficult question to answer directly in a very concise
 which way do you want to know who's attacking you but there's I guess but everything was built by trust right and so in a way everyone can lie and an environment where you have
 you know multiple networks in multiple connections and you have to stay busy it's very difficult to find the needle in the haystack and the people's answers so far have been alright we'll just collect everything and then we'll sauce it out later or we're going to get hacked anyway so you know let's just get on the let's just be on feature creep keep releasing new stuff until eventually we get hacked and then we'll come out with a public apology and then we'll get her act together as some businesses are taking advantage of that and trying to me to provide insurance and response policies for in case when you get hacked this is how you should reply this is how you should respond and it's it's it's a very difficult subject in Oak Ridge we're kind of concerned of course with government facilities and things of that nature and recently were more focused on the energy grid being a member of the d o e kind of protecting that and then come up with new technologies anyways to kind of mitigate attacks are coming and of course before they happen and analyzing stuff if it doesn't
 really happened finding out the best way to a tribute and then I'll Rectify any sort of attack that's been dependent on machine learning and taking advantage of Titan cuz we have a supercomputer and we tend to use it so that we do take advantage of the resources available but why that's been real recently taken advantage of machine learning and trying to classify these things to make at least the attribute probably a little bit easier but it's still a bear it's and it's very hard to do how would machine learning be useful here at the do you have all like a labeled data set of of traffic and and you can just kind of a build correlations from those traffic patterns and then when a new request comes in you can you know from machine learning the you know where it's coming from yeah it's kind of like signature detection in a way we're like I've seen this type of binary before you know I'm just going to go ahead and clean it up before you called me
 antiviruses in the past relied upon signature-based detection so let's say you know I keep bringing up Grandma and I don't mean to poke it grandmother's everywhere that are really keen on cybersecurity but if someone you love click the Badland car goes to a bad website and download something they shouldn't Saturday or kind of older antiviruses at this point it's still used but it would recognize the binary that they downloaded right before they were able to double click it or anything of that nature open a door release it into the you know actually execute the program downloaded it would recognize it by its signature right they would have seen it before put in a database and then your antivirus would recognize that same signature and delete it before you could do damage to yourself so that's kind of the premise behind it I will machine learning can do and at least my exposure to it so far it's been four classification it's really good at classifying or these how were using it so they
 classifying types of types of network traffic this is been done kind of Wylie but we're aiming to use it for kind of Novel Network traffic and kind of network patterns unique to our environments because government labs are not really we are large but we tend to run that works are different than a lot of like maybe corporate networks are kind of cookies are archives build we have to rely upon a lot of public services and a lot of other public facilities such as other Laboratories and other universities and other governments right and other countries so we kind of have to operate a little differently so we kind of we use our machine learning techniques to analyze the traffic we particularly see and the ones that we see in the wild and hopefully we see if you attacks we see if you you know but 9 stuff and we build a machine learning algorithm that can classify between the two and hopefully alert you you know if it's seen some type of it
 more traffic at seen before right and just to be clear you have to see some to the reason said hopefully we can get my taxes because you need to see some attacks in order to build in a classifier of attacks Airways that's actually part of my effort is you know you can have some people in there poking out of machine in the ways that they know how right like you know I can help train it right I can try to attack a system while I'm there or or try to do some other stuff to help train the bot but you're not going to be able to prevent well actually you could prevent some types of Novel attacks provided they have certain Primitives that you could detect for example let's say I have a really bad piece of malware and I keep changing it every time it's been detected so the actual binary the actual executable keep changing but I keep sending you an email you know that's consistent with them you know my payLo deliveries consistent I can't recognize that particular signature but I can recognize the network traffic
 you know it's always consistent before my particular unique payload comes in so I could train you know machine learning algorithm can know well it doesn't need to know the payload to know that it's a type of network pattern that's indicative of malicious behavior till you mentioned that you're working on power grid security can you get involved in securing a power grid well I think the best way to I'm very new to this acid like 2 weeks ago so I am but that's kind of been our most recent initiative my education with an and I'm just I'm just a lowly pentester I don't claim to settle claim to be any higher than anyone else really learning and I really see myself as a student of all these Technologies and my perception of it is not necessarily protecting the power grid but once you start seeing the power grid I think you may have heard like this
 where the smart grid and all that jazz the smart grid when you really take a look at it is a sensor Network and it's huge and when you start to look at it like a network and you know that's that's old news right like we've been protecting that work since networks have been out but the power grid specifically has unique problems to it specifically between trying to load balance of power across multiple about across multiple grades how do you best distribute power and how do you best see you can provide brownouts and things of that nature how do you secure your sensors cuz you may have you know Rebels or what not to give themselves all the power in to try to run out an area or you can have them try to In Spite of what your PlayStation is saying so your base stations like well you're not at work you know you're at home I've consistently seen the during the hours of
 925 or 1808 at 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. you're not home so I don't need to be sending every ounce of power I have to keep you furnished near you keep your house fully supplied as if you were going to turn on every single Appliance in your house but you could have people that are just trying to get power for free or to try to abuse it to take advantage of those low power usage times is a lot of interesting problems that can occur
 you show me an article that Bruce schneier wrote called ransomware and the internet of things and we play early on we had we did one of the first 20 or 30 shows we did was with Bruce and Jesus great great guest really interesting guy to talk to and you know he's I think it would he's so good at is synthesizing a lot of different ideas and being able to articulate kind of the Gestalt of the learning that are going on in the security industry at any given time and it's kind of like I'm kind of like a Brian Krebs Krebs seems like he's he's almost more of an investigative journalist and he's not afraid to like get himself in the middle of the action but anyways ransomware in the internet of things we've already talked about both of these basically I mean the Internet of Things in regard to cars and the power grid perhaps things that
 like when we kind of need on the internet but in some ways we really are afraid to put them on the Internet we don't want them on the Internet and ransomware you know we are touched on on this why are these two topics related I think they're related because Holly you have a trusted
 environment and and I say trusted because you want to really trust the internet of things like I think a lot of people they would they want to have a digital thermometer digital thermostat you know they want to be able to change it from home then who want to be able to control their power in case of brown outs you know they want to be able to power company to say you need more power in ordering brownouts or today that there is definitely a push from both and not there was a push from both the commercial side and you know the public for a lot of these small devices and more fine-grained control and an end better efficiency amongst these things that we use the iot for a kind of guy catching myself using iot I personally am studying sensor networks and it makes
 I fix IRT is a giant catch-all for a lot of things so I'll continue to use it for this example but my brains kind of compartment lock them into like you know Amazon echos versus you know full by your full stack like what weather sensor networks and stuff like that but I ran somewhere is because it's the idea that something so cheap could kind of break down something that is built on things that are supposed to be kind of cheap right now the whole aspect of the things part of the Internet of Things is that the kind of disposable there just a single-use or single item right that is just the small thing that essentially contributes to a larger in a system and the idea that I could be crippled by you know someone by my sensor Network for example my my weather sensor Network could be crippled
 someone walking up to a tree you know grabbing my sensor and then fiddling with it and then it warms its way through my entire network because they took down one of my insignificant things right like it if it's kind of interesting in that way but I do see the the parallels I do see how this is kind of growing in that way since like the ransomware and IRC stuff but that you know the what was the the major attack that hit that DNS by Mariah by digging for well it's interesting because a lot of the things can't really be patched you know everyone's like will just update your firmware and whatnot but some of the actual endpoints the things in the internet of things that was compromised I like DVD players and like how do you upgrade the firmware on your DVD you throw it out you buy a new one
 you don't you know you don't for a webcam you just buy a new webcam you don't typically plug it into your USB drive or do or Worse those things are typically placed and then kind of Forgotten you don't really remember that there's a webcam watching your tablet to your college and that there's actually like some weird webcam on campus that was installed for whatever reason you can't really facility all of those Nuance things and then all the sudden you know it's it's taking part in this huge DNS hack and now you're responsible like how it it's very it's very interesting I guess I'll say that much that's really interesting it's so if I've got my webcam in my DVD player I guess these things are not set up to take to take updates to operating system over-the-air basically
 yeah it's kind of an afterthought at least if they and if they did think of it that you just hope that it's convenient you you really hope that you don't have to sit up there and have to download their proprietary software to specifically speak over USB or heaven forbid some sort of converter to plug into their micro USB port and then have to reflash the firmware of your of your $10 Chinese webcam because you just wanted to watch your front door when you're away and you know people don't want to be sysadmins sysadmins barely want to be sysadmin

 just to clarify for people who don't know about this attack the Mirai botnet attack was basically there was a large company in China that made cameras that cameras that went on all kinds of products on I think on webcams and security cameras and I don't know what name your kind of camera are the kind of camera that you know sits in a stuffed animal if you have a stuffed animal that has a camera in it and these were all vulnerable to basically they have the same login so you could log into them remotely using the same data standard username and password the man bro I bought that found that out and logged into all of them and then launch DDOS attacks and you know Schneider's Point around that time and in this article that ran somewhere and iot is that the current model of Microsoft and Apple and other big corporations being able to protect us will fail in the internet of things and
 I think part of that is because these companies the giant companies are no longer the only ones who can mass-produce hardware and put that Hardware in consumer products and and put it in important places I mean what it what are the other reasons that this new wave of Internet of Things is is different and requires a different approach I think one of the most interesting aspects of it and I know I keep harping on this because I really think it's kind of the core problem it's not necessarily that I think there's a lot of players steak I think having a lot of players steak I mean you can say what you want about the free market but having a lot of players and you know kind of influencing the web and influencing The Internet of Things it's kind of just how kind of companies battle that out of town new fields are kind of you know waged over like Computing in the early 90s to mid 90s right and in some cases still now
 the Google and I don't think it's so much the players as it is the problem of a small embedded group that doesn't necessarily have you know where does the lowest better are those the lowest provider right through the cheapest product somehow influencing a lot of other businesses and a lot of other companies and their reputation isn't as widely known and they're updating platform isn't as robust I think I think a lot of this comes down to the fact that sure you know I can have I can have 10 little webcams at my house and set up my own personal love you know reenactment of Big Brother myself and my dog but I think that the biggest problem with this is the fact that I have to update all these and that's not necessarily done in a very good or secure way even if and if
 you know what provider Works actually do that automatically or in a way that is less intrusive or or kind of provide a very user-friendly way of securing the home and I know that there are some people looking for that especially through software-defined networks that's actually Avenue some people are investigating him you know maybe you don't need to be a big bad sysadmin but maybe your you know your home router can do some of this for you and I can actually take some of this take some of the burden out of managing this stuff for you some people are investigating that but I really think it's the updating issue at the carnival it always comes back to people want to release a patch if you don't release the patch thing you're not going to buy the product anymore but you know you're going to lose business but if you actually do fix the problem and needs to get out there and he needs to get out there now and the bigger corporations can do that they have established Frameworks for it and allow the little guys were just struggling
 idea that we need government intervention in iot standards it burst it in a lot of ways it made it possible it made people allowed people to lay down cable and pipe and do a lot of other cool stuff but at the same time then you have aspects of it they're trying to Vie for control and you know they try to take some of these things away
 I'm not as in spite of my status as a government employee I'm not as I think there is a strive for standardization regulation especially during kind of them though the early kind of fettered stages of this development right and I know that there are some efforts in the EU for like safety guideline so you can't release an iot or you can't deploy in iot product in the EU you can't deploy it unless it follows a certain guidelines in there these certain ways of updating it and then privacy things are all put in place since you can't even deploy your little webcam yours illegal to unless it falls all these guidelines so that's kind of an extreme in Mike and in my view but I do think that there is a craving right now and there's definitely a demand for some standard for some way to communicate to these little things and have them behave in a way in a way it kind of is like the early internet I do see an hour I'd see the analogy for those too late or the
 similarities between the two very strongly yeah you had each independent College coming out with its own way of doing communication and then they all kind of TCP IP 10 just just kind of one and then everyone started communicating over TCP IP as the kind of bona fide transport layer between college to college so I feel like there is there's definitely people fighting for some for something right now but I think that that's kind of why if I would have I'm not a betting man but I feel like that's coming so I am a betting man in what I would actually Bruce is wrong I think that the the model of those giant corporations is going to save us because I think the thing is these giant corporations are going to be able to layer so much value into their iot offerings whatever that means I could look Android for example has an Internet of Things platform that I know that they're pushing I've been trying to do a show about this haven't gotten haven't wrangled some reason the
 quiet word for Android. There's a reason Android 1 the smartphone market every every aspect of it where where Apple didn't is because basically they said look we're going to take care of all the crap that you don't want to take care of and you know you build your application on top of it and suck that's a great deal and you know maybe the Amazon platform will be in okay you can you get a voice assistant on top of it why cuz that's that I think that is Android I think they think Amazon Echo Runza version of Android if I remember but I think like that did that's the direction I mean I'm just I'm editorializing here basically that didn't make sense to me whatever that stupid camera company was the more I bought a company that had all the same default username and password if you're that company it's not like you want this kind of crap to happen like you would love to opt-in for yeah I'll use the end
 play things platform instead of some random Linux distribution because you're not going to get all these additional things from from an Android I don't know I don't really understand what I do I still would Bruce expect to get out of the government trying to regulate this this stuff I think it's just more of like a wrangling the kids sort of thing but I think I'll also I have my own personal opinions in it which is I think you have the kids are play you're going to have a lot of smaller companies trying to use the Internet of Things in an effective way to offer a unique product for their customers and while I do think you know is Android or even Amazon or someone crazy they have some with a lot of clout can offer a consistent standardized way of doing this that way they take care of all the iot junk but as long as you build you know your web cameras with these particular specifications we can you can deploy are software in there and we'll take care of the nonsense for you I still think it's kind of pushing towards some sort of
 some sort of standard whether or not that's proprietary or if it's open as is being up for the Mad grab but I think the companies are going to fight that out you see you also referred me to this paper on this very topic the standardization and certification of the internet of things this was a good article I'll put in the show notes to so it's kind of an overview of like attempts in discussions of standard is over how old like this very topic and the author's to motivate this discussion the authors describe a cumming collision between two worlds in this is sort of like the scent is similar alarm bells to what Bruce schneier is ringing but they describe this collision between two worlds World of patched software like an operating system like you know your Mac OS X it out and update overnight and it just gets patched and that's totally fine but then there's this other while that's the stable world of safety-critical Machinery like a heart rate monitor I'm sure you probably see this kind of stuff in the power grid space is
 well yeah why are these two worlds colliding very interesting question and why are they called Whiting why are they at odds with each other and that's why I mean
 you get Mom a little stumped by it honestly I feel like yeah it will the reason confuses me is it necessary that I don't see that there that there is contention but that it hasn't kind of that it had that a hybrid hasn't kind of been met right like that you have certain critical infrastructures that are completely on unspoken for but then you build bigger better network of patch software and all this other jazz on top of it you know I guess it's a little Elsa said me and kind of feminine side of me wants to marry the to write like they don't need to fight you know you are to do some hobbyist stuff with drones and I don't know how much you've looked into drones I did a show with wasabi from everywhere and and he was talking about
 how they do operating system Security in in drones when it's basically like okay a Securities really important here like I just as important in a car as in a car and they have the basically every drone has two operating systems in it and so they don't but they have their cake and eat it too because they have a safety critical operating system and then mission-critical operating system that's supposed to be very inflexible what's supposed to be safety-critical stuff and then they have a very well-defined communication protocol between that and a more open operating system that that's its aren't you know in the same drone and it does yeah that one's able to take high-level flexible commands and it can put sort of you interpret them and perhaps filter them through to the more mission-critical operating system actually I don't think that's that there this is this is like something that they just mutually exclusive but you know if if that is the model if it's like
 two Operating System model One mission critical in one like more open if that's what's going to be installed in all operating systems are more more more devices then I guess that could change could change because technically you just built the Linux kernel if you really wanted to get you know right and there is a protected aspect of it and they and there's users and you know you can see this model kind of exhibited Elsewhere so yeah I think right now everyone is just I think we are kind of a wash with the possibilities of what this could do you and much like I think the time for scrapping maybe has passed like there was a lot of people scrapping at the early internet and I think I take that back I think it's still fairly young as a field but there's a lot that has yet to be discovered and found out or tested in this in this new world
 little bit more about what you're working on right now so you touched on sensor networks you touched on the power grid can you just give a little bit more of an outline of the research that you're focused on okay so I previously my research fun doing upgrades was upon I like specifically Network level security I had worked in previous previous employment was at Cisco Systems and yeah so networking's kind of you just you just do what you just end up letting you know so and I have at this point Oakridge is a weird place it is a National Lab but because I'm kind of rank as an engineer I get kind of thrown on projects Millie Willie you know what whatever is available so I've been working on specifically the vehicle security aspect stuff which is kind of what I had spoke about it my b-sides talk vehicle-to-vehicle security you know when that protocols rolled out whatever its impact
 my new kind of interesting thing which is which led me to drones actually which is software-defined Radio people think radios kind of dead but then you end up looking at you know you're all of the stuff that's Wireless in your house and then you'll suddenly realize that you are you are very wrong so soft where to find radios in and poking at that stuff there's also in somebody's house well you got to think about specifically you have the 802 right give the what is the two amateur bands right which I think is a 2.4 gigahertz and 5.8 gigahertz are kind of the amateur bands and in that you actually have wireless traffic Bluetooth all the also operates in that you have you know standard radio if you're talking about if I just set up a radio going inside my house what will I see you'll see those two bands typically you'll see FM AM radio if you have it's free to listen but you know some channels are protected
 free to listen but it's you know you need that ham license before you start transmitting stuff but there's actually a surprising amount going on in this in the software-defined radio field so I'm just getting my toes wet in it but the thing I got me most of it got me into drones and specifically drone racing which is my current kind of hobby because I was feeling around and it uses both 2.4 and 5.8 in order doors a 5.4 I need to figure that out too kind of navigate in order for you to see through the goggles as you're flying and to transmit you know you get to give your input sender transmitter and actually fly around and people were talking about how you can hack it and how you could take advantage of more drones that are based on cinematography so they don't really have room they're not as a very very robust and so you got to take advantage of aspects of that and I got me into the the racing field but as far as right now I'm still finishing my thesis and I'm trying to focus it
 on wireless sensor networks so throwing up a bunch of networks across maybe a desert or a rainforest and they collect information or disseminate information and report back to a base station how did those things interact and specifically how do you verify the software running on that thing you know if it's compromise then someone drops it back in the same place is it in the correct location has it been moved has the firmware been altered and you need to verify you need to verify this from the base station while consuming is little power as possible because power is a priority for these things they don't they can't run forever and and trans and communication is very expensive because it's the most costly thing for those batteries see you after I kind of think about all these weird it's super interesting problem set is now is that relevant to Oakridge or toy or work out because
 you like this is like have a military sort of thing or I guess due to the weather reporting why is security of a sensor Network that's did might be sitting strength throughout a desert why is that important in like what why security their big a big concern just simply well why you don't want people mucking with it in general but yeah you kind of can easily see the word censor be replaced with a soldier and that tends to have its own in packs with our neighbors at the dod but as far as the. Specifically I can see it mostly for just you literally take the wireless part out of it and then replace sensor with a smart sensor and then it's it's directly applicable to the smart grid and you can do a lot of the cool and interesting stuff with your previous research Tammy Lee applies to that and so it's you working with small embedded device
 is the can't really do anything but repower I'm taking inputs and then govern power from that and so and what kind of working fairly well what else are you looking at what else is interesting in the area of network and Cloud security and or or anything that you're seeing at at Oakridge cuz I know there's a lot of interesting projects at Oakridge I wish I could say well right now we have at least two kind of cool ish projects they're mostly related with our focus is mostly on machine learning how to complete each how can we teach ourselves to classify bad behavior that's a huge problem and you know we're actively working on aspects of that and once you gather all this data to say you're a wash with data which is a particular problem with government facilities because of auditing right like you can get audited for anything so you just collect everything that you end up having more logs then or what's useful see you have this Treasure Trove date of how you
 system or how any of these Public Services have been used how do you mind that efficiently how do you do that end in the realm of security specifically is there a parent behavior in the patterns is it somewhere buried in here and what's the best way to visually present that those are pretty much the directors of our two teams won led by John Goodall and the other group I belong to which is the Software System security research team recently the name change the system security research team and those are kind of the problems that we're trying to investigate thanks for coming out so friend Gayle it's been really enjoyable and wide-ranging conversation about security thank you so much

Transcription: two-sided Market places are a great way to resolve supply and demand in efficiencies there is such high demand for great programmers but there is only a limited Supply so why would it make sense for a great developer to use a terrible tool like a job search engine that's why I love hired.com developers can sign up at hired.com software engineering daily and be connected with five great job opportunities at companies like stripe Uber and Facebook if you're a developer you shouldn't settle for a mediocre job I know this from personal experience it will stunt your career growth hard will give you a $2,000 bonus if you find a job and if you go to hired.com software engineering daily you will get an additional $2,000 it cost you nothing to try it out and it's a fun process I urge you to try it out
Trini calamari teachers and writes about data science at dataquest and has worked as a data scientist at several companies in the past Serena welcome to software engineering daily
 so we got a bunch of topics to discuss today data science data engineering tensorflow other topics but I want to start by talking a bit about what you are working on which is dataquest we did a show with your dataquest coworker Vic paruchuri surf lessons are curious they can listen back to the episode from where you sit what is dataquest and what are you working on there so the mission of daily Quest is to allow anyone to be able to work with data so we basically provide an Interactive Learning platform where anyone can go with very little experience experience learn how to write how to work with data how to kind of understand grasp the concept behind statistics in machine Learning Station etcetera and basically how to go from 0 to getting stuff done with data
 how big is the market of people that want to learn data science is that the market besides the market of people who want to learn data science is really big and we think it's way bigger than for example number of people who want to learn how to build software people who Subway shaper for work with data there's a lot more people sequel is probably the most popular programming language using I'm a righty of tools data science is incredibly Broad and not really seen a great solution for kind of figure out what you don't know about Linda Purl side to a great job in the kind of General software engineer in space we have yet to see a really good
 product data science space and we hope to kind of be that product and part of the way that you're you're solving that problem is by developing an in-browser experience sort of like a game of five experience how well does that in-browser experience that you created at dataquest how does that translate to the day-to-day work as a data scientist
 yeah that's a good question so we try to get as close as possible and so we basically each step of the learning phase try to figure out what makes the most sense so any kind of introductory Python and pandas and statistics lessons the interface resembles just introduced guided products for example where the interface is kind of this mix of shell shell and actual what code Snippets as well as a kind of interface that resembles very closely for the ipython-notebook interface and so those interface or kind of help people transition from the kind of benefits of mixing tax and coder running and evaluating code to see if you got a right to kind of the more day today workflow
 foremost a scientist which is kind of iPod The Notebook 4 2 / notebook is not was called a workflow and if you're not familiar with a project that has what kind of a kernel and kind of eval Loop along with a notebook for Mexican kind of mix explaining and kind of teaching concepts are exploring concepts with my wife code it's the 6 x Cube live shows as we've talked about data science and data engineering I think it's still something that's worth delving into to provide some definitions you're actually the first person to point out to me that there is this bifurcation enrolls between data science and data engineering I think many people listening probably don't know the distinction between these two rolls and it's kind of an evolving theme in computer science and software engineering how would you define these tours
 data science and data engineering totally sedated data scientist is essentially someone who you no more or less is he trying to use data to do signs their primarily interested DC data is a tool and it's a way of understanding size it's the way of understanding some process and so they're primarily concerned with the kind of an SSP Cid in the theory the math there fundamentally kind of interested in the business problems and you can solve with data engineer is someone who's spent a lot more time figuring out how to store data how to collect data how to kind of supplement the data scientist and said that's kind of a difference in the roles basically no one won the dangers are very focused on the storage kind of how to share the data how to work with the data of a little bit less informed on how the date is actually
 Tatum sounds not that interested in using the data to reach decisions so that's way more interested in it and actually what the date I can tell them that's why it's a really great Heron the kind of evolved over time separation-of-concerns exactly so when a product company is getting started you know generally like elastic Victoria product hunt for example or name your hot start up originally like they're focused very much on their core offering which probably that they're not they're not thinking as much about user data they're not thinking about the three types of ancillary data that their product is giving off sort of So eventually the product company starts to gain traction and you know really on the the decision of these companies don't really have data scientist cuz they're so focused on their core product But as time goes on there they need to take advantage of their data so what is a typical road map
 a company decides okay we've we're starting to scale we need to hire data scientist or or do they need to look at hiring data Engineers for a sec what is the what are the best practice is to starting to accumulate a data organization I think it's very similar to the way that engineering would be getting kind of the initial Engineers are doing everything from to wait to test in to live a production stopped going to stop in overtime you have as you mentioned the separation concerned I think more or less data science and I think it's basically an evolution in complexity so you know you really only collecting really basic data that can fit in one sequel database than overtime that kind of a balls and essentially all about understanding process
 sniffing the evolution matches the evolution of complexity of the process has the process gets more more complex as he want to measure board more anyone understand one word of what's going on in your software product you want to build more sophisticated Solutions you want individual entire team's possibly dedicated to to just a product to understand just how one product works and so I think that evolution is kind of braids natural exist but I depend on how either the pot out to the team the company structure but you're totally right then the beginning really is just kind of one guy maybe part time and then is summer doing it full-time and then it's kind of a team that's really it was really quite interesting and yeah
 so no best practices yet baby cuz it's just I guess it just depends on the stack and the situation and how important data scientist the organization best practices are Jeff hammerbacher DJ patil definitely have really good both talks and kind of O'Reilly books about avocado kind of real to data science how to build their science teams they're definitely kind of War stories that you can learn from those guys a bunch of great talks Spotify Netflix and you can hear about their War Stories as well but I think that's exactly what it is and that there were some lessons you can take away but I do think a little different for each company
 so what are the shows we did do with think it was it was Insight data science where the no I'm sorry this was zipfian Academy now Galvanize data science where they were talking about how there's this Miss understanding kind of in some of the hiring facilities of a company often times and what the realities are of of what a data scientist Cape is capable of so how does it how does manifested companies will often post job positions for data science unicorns that say they were looking for data scientist must know my sequel must have spark must know XYZ you nosey Prime Z double Prime what are what is the minimum viable set of technologies that a data scientist needs to know and that a data engineer needs to know so I think those are two different kind of question
 sore ideas the first would definitely I think is maybe just a failure of understanding what did they decide does does so the kind of the buzzword a job post I think that's I think that's a good signal for kind of a not so developed or clipping experience that affects culture within a company and I think I think the place is like Netflix Spotify to do have good sides cultures and established Rossi's day they know kind of what they know what people want to or people are looking for a job postings and they try to avoid Just Let It Go the buzzwords the second part is interested in chatting question I think as I mentioned earlier it does really depend on the company for example a Google has position called quantitative analyst which is kind of their word for data scientists and those guys base about resetting work a lot and are and stata that kind of stuff it's those guys you know they
 moron quantitative Concepts in your understanding of really hardcore theoretical ideas / say your experience with spark it so that's what it does depend on the company but I will save obviously kind of based on what we teach dataquest we're pretty we're pretty big Believers that like everyday the scientist that did Adams needs to know Python and sequel at the minimum of those are kind of in our opinion and what we seen as well talking to companies and people of what two companies the two most common languages other people use definitely sequel we do teach some are and we still see a lot of organizations that do use are and so for people who have more of that quantitative hardcore background or tends to be more common to didn't rain
 that's a very quickly that it's actually quite interesting I think it does depend a lot on the company so if you want to work at certain company they only use spark for example like one of my previous employers that you know look like learning Spartacus like the way though I do think the most important language to know is Java and the jvm does those most of these distributed processing tools are built use the jvm and so I think having a good match for the jvm learning at least Parker to do and just being familiar with these other crab libraries a lot of stuff you guys have talked about I think is kind of the type of bedroom are there any more job responsibilities Within These data science in data engineering verticals to that will get unbundled further like are we going to have assistant data in assistant you know
 mystery break break down even further so I'll give you a dataquest weird shift a data analyst track as well and we were actually pretty big Believers of a date out of a straw with a lot of places like economic consulting firms or even actually have a different role for a data analyst a data scientist / research scientist and engineer I think I'm more mature data centralization that kind of Trifecta of kind of this person who's like what kind of business intelligence person you can say they use a lot of baby python some are sequel Excel that you have more sides roll which is usually PhD is not always the case at least a master's degree in most cases who are way more folks in the bottles then you have a Skype date in Jeanerette engineer person who is
 devops not going to stop I think we might see more we might need an engineer get broken down more between kind of a devops and a and a roll that's maybe more tightly coupled with data science so it's hard to take the credit for close up I guess yes I definitely think that's there that's still in the last roll it's incredibly underappreciated is presentation visualization! Think we will see this kind of hard to see it Lexus Hybrid of a data visualization engineer and designer who kind of is really good at poker do blog post who can try to communicate great really good reports and the more explanatory Human Side a business is still very I think under pressure
 interesting yeah so I mean that dead raised interesting question like how much of the work of the data scientist is or how much are the responsibilities of the data scientist is generating the right queries verses explaining the meaning of those queries I guess they're explaining that the statistical explaining of the conclusions that that one should draw off of the results interesting concrete question so so so a data scientist like you know no needs to make me know some sequel versus noise when Sparks who is just about spark but hasn't actually worked on it which is you know admitting probably send to some listeners but nonetheless it's the truth I have not worked at spark you know what do I need to know about Spark
 I need to like what is what is a spark query consist of and how does that differ from like just a sequel query so it's not quite the spark is still kind of a framework you can think of it as you know but they said it's really just a generalization produce it's actually I would say so much closer to a programming language than a very specific language like like like Sequel and so like for example you can use spark just for data processing and not even doing it daily science percent you can just use it the kind of storm add data but not even doing and I think yeah that's what I forgot your real-life conversation
 you are talking about your work as a data scientist at one of your previous jobs and you said that that working with spark from your end as a data scientist was not difficult at all it was I think you drew the analogy between working with spark and just like entering sequel queries so maybe I miss remembering our conversation but I'm just curious like you know I've entered sequel queries before how much of a jump is it to enter a spark query yeah I think it is quite different I think the more appropriate job is between the iPod on Notebook flow and the spark plug on his abbreviations for this a lot of things do you use the kind of Jupiter notebook / ipython-notebook workflow to kind of interactively Explorer data and I think what the spark guys really focused on which is
 basically uses its Library called Piper J and it allows you to write python code along with the library in a sped python code generate kind of code that runs on JV and so it was kind of a cracked with completely using python is if you know python you no spark I think that's that's essentially delete that I might have mentioned I think yeah if you still owe me no sequel you still may not appreciate just how programming works like error messages and there's still a lot of kind of programming suggest no sequel you may not be all at home within a couple of with spark but I definitely think if you're ever used Skype I thought notebook workflow you've done some pandas before I'm done with work with data is notebook stop or Matt I think it's really easy maybe a few days tops
 to make that transition to the kind of pie spark workflow what I'm referring to okay got it so many of the people who listen to this show categorize themselves either as software Engineers another there either back in infrastructure or they work on front-end web Frameworks I don't think I have a ton of listeners who categorize themselves as data scientist or data engineers and ostensibly many of the engineers that are is due back in infrastructure or front-end web framework the people who I believe are the bulk of the listeners they don't need to know much about data science or machine learning but if if they were going to learn some material what are the things that they absolutely need to know about data science and machine learning
 I think the most important thing to to know about that assigns is just kind of the data skepticism it it's just kind of I think I really did data science just like this by the sense of it it's a way of thinking is it in so I just like you can look at any process object in the world and understand maybe the trade-off that were made you decide to the design decisions that were made I think you can think about any kind of damn baby New York Times headline or any kind of report that you might see it at work or kind of a I don't know some diagram that some NBA came up with at your workplace and just think about like what was the kind of the assumption that were made that report was created or or even kind of like why you're working on something so I think what a nice relaxing day I think LinkedIn from sample did really well was they made data scientist super important and gave him a lot of a ton
 the organization in so there's a story of Peter's can wash it was Peter kind of came up with the friend or whatever feature on LinkedIn and that was kind of a data scientist who came up with the speaker that really drove a lot of Engagement I think that kind of marriage between is really healthy so I do think like trying to figure out more about like why example on a certain feature or you is is is this the right thing to focus on and just I'm the kind of stuff skepticism and try to understand like show me the data like why is this the right thing to do I don't know if that's just a healthy attitude to have a general I think that's probably the biggest can I take away an important kind of fool softball thing about dating sites that everyone should learn so are you saying that organizations
 not work on features if they can't back up the justification for that feature with data I think maybe not quite there are many cases where you know like you actually don't have the data and you still have to make a decision there's a great article talking about it being dated formed which is data-driven I think it many case we do something completely new it is kind of hard to really have like oh let's let's like do a bunch of the analysis and figure out if it's right or not I do think every decision to be data and form so what are some kind of General things that are going on the business and that makes sense pressure decision or even more so like in D kind of iterative Engineering Process can you push something out quickly and then you stated a measure people's reactions to a new feature or call Clyde's reactions to new feature or something like that so I think
 we could be after in some cases but I do think I'm looking at the data at trying to see how good your decision is so important everything you could go wrong as well so you know there's sometimes you do have to kind of pickle fork in the road and just went to pick a path and I did get to go eat something but at least kind of make sure that your Mondragon fixed and ensuring that it is the right decision

 get back to the things that you can't on me like writing code
 this New York Times headlines stuff and being skeptical of that and you know one of the things I think about is you know often times with New York Times medical section for example or some kind of scientific report what happens is you know you have a study that gets published and it will say something like I owe you know if we realize that this bacteria has a 30% chance of doing acts and it gets translated into a New York Times headline of bacteria cause this you know it where is actually still 30% you know 30% incident there correlation right or whatever and so do you think that data and data science becomes permeates the the public awareness at an increasing rate do you think we'll have headlines
 and in sound bites that have an increase in granularity of of Truth to them or do you think of this like you know kind of information condensation into a headline what will discontinue I'm not sure if the headlines selves will get all that better I think there's a brand kind of Market pistol I think like me to Frank Zappa like a box media's headlines I think our way better than maybe buzzfeed's but I don't know if I could have changed it all depends on the target audience in overall more and more Publications are using data and they are using graphs in the actual explanation the actual post it so the headlines because of the way Twitter and Facebook working this time always other than walking realities or maybe headlines could still drive the eyeballs but hopefully when people the kind of reasonably tell
 people who actually want to dive in even if it's not all the way to Source particle but at least the source research paper at least read the paper read this. Read the post carefully I hopefully and we are seeing this with clam York Times and a lot of other box be as well where they are including a lot more crafts a lot more data links to the source data sets sometimes I do 538 is the Gold Standard whey Everest the data translator or data presentation layer Specialist or whatever that role is the emergence of the role of huge spike in the last 10 years were here there's that this entire professionals people who are like kind of semi computer scientist engineer send me stats person and send me your list and
 I love this really interesting unicorn maybe but it's really kind of intersection of skills were it's all about storytelling using data and I think I think all the modern Publications have really impressed at 5:38 in New York Times have real at the charge they're really good interactive Graphics team today I think they have the highest quality work but we're seeing this kind of war at war with everyone if people want to people like in Africa by 20 years people will make me care less about graphs and data but now people are demanding data the some great poles that show that studies that show that Millennials specially really want they like seeing graphs to like seeing data and that's somehow more convincing the danger however I said earlier but over quantify is the people you stated tell the wrong story so there still is at that needs kind of balance out as well cuz you can definitely use yeah you can get the data to say anything you want right and so yeah
 and I've definitely seen some really interesting blog post about like graphs that totally missed represent the truth just because they use like interesting angles and see exactly how it's going to take maybe 15 hundred years it's really kind of but I think it's where we at now is relatively healthy and it's great to see that uses data and pretty much every single post that that's like I don't know if you could have done that 30 years ago I don't know if there was even audience for it and I think that they're all kind of Pinnacle of that kind of tired even kind of Publications within large media organizations of the city lab Atlantic the city lab is very weird I think it's okay it's real it's a really exciting time just in data science General yeah speaking of Journalism I mean you're listening to software engineering daily and
 I would love to get your feedback on what are the areas of data science and data engineering that you would like to see covered more and what are the things that I don't cover well if you could you can navigate to you know software engineering daily.com and you click on it and you see like you know some articles and you see a podcast what are the topics that you wish were covered more yeah that's a good question I think I change coverage of kind of data science process would be more interesting so there's a lot of gray coverage on kind of libraries Tools in it and so they should be focus on the tools in the soccer products and I think I passed to go deeper today besides I think exploring a lot more into how data science is actually died the workflow
 I know when you need Spotify guy he had some kind of good explanation of what is day today looks like I think that's probably I think that's really important and really interesting I'm even even questions like what are the most common problems that are they the scientists and Engineers Work Fit I think you can read the headlines maybe I don't know much but they might think it's all like deep neural network Crazy Patsy aiai stuff but I do be surprised just like how much of it is just counting and like regression and just need to look really not super complex techniques 90% of days is not kind of bees really fancy models but you'll see you know so that's really it should I think letting people can have get aware of that is looking super important when you think about the episodes that make your ears glaze over or that or the episodes that really like Peak your interest the entire time
 is it about the topics is it like is it anecdotes like do you enjoy like a Spotify episode when we talked about you know kind of Spotify is data science in practice is that more interesting than going down the rabbit hole of some specific technology and how it works in it at a theoretical level or like what do you get what do you like to see from a metal of exploring the evolution of something is really interesting even when you interview. I think it was JoJo All on her he talked about how their frustrations at Airbnb cause them to start packing list that story so some of that is great even at Netflix on Spotify talking about what they had before then what they kind of had to evolve into was really entertain tense of full episode kind of
 disbelief tensorflow was really interesting I think that's like I think a podcast interviews are really good interface and a good medium for discovering that kind of evolution the war story I think those are the episodes I have kind of historically enjoyed the most just really kind of that contacts and getting filled in that kind of a deep relationship and getting into what was what was that person or team experiencing that led them to their work it out created to solve real business problem it's a learning about those problems and how they solve them I think is the most interesting thing that you soften trindale is a really well
 yeah I think it is the storytelling I think of store the storytelling that drives into the technical aspects are what what creates a really interesting a conclusion you you're a contributor to the data Quest blog which has some great post one post that I liked gave a really sick synced introduction to spark and this is really useful to someone like me who basically just reports on sparking and hasn't worked much with it directly but beyond the raw tutorial style informational post you also have an interview that you conduct with data scientists and when you're talking with these different data scientists what are the things that you find in common
 oh that's addressed really interesting I definitely think
 that's what election question
 or you just said is that has brought is like saying what are the different things you find in common with software Engineers but it all the time is that there is any people may be under estimate from the outside looking in just how much time is spent on all the data janitorial stops even if you are happy to have all the simple structure and stuff for even even even spending like 20 minutes to write the sequel care you know what you want already but you have to express it in the Wake computer to understand it right so there's like there's that is actually down in the day that there's like getting it into pandas or whatever toolset you use and there's there's a lot of yeah I think maybe people think that it's like a scene from Iron Man people are just like the manipulated data it's like yeah maybe one day right but look for now it's if there's so much time is definitely spent on just
 formatting it it's kind of all these all these things I can come up to definitely holler at that is something we all is well we don't really have that that enough maybe in our or interview questions those actually could be back but yeah it's definitely a comes up comes up quite a bit okay well let's talk about one of the companies that you've interviewed you you recently talked to stitch fix what uses data science and algorithms to improve the selection of merchandise to clients tell me about Stitch fix his approach to data science
 yeah then approach is very interesting so just a quick overview Stitch fix is basically you know you if you're kind of lady if you want if you want to fix for you get clothes delivered to you they basically you spend like 50 or $60 and a pic they hand-select clothes they sent to you and they know a lot about your style your personality your lifestyle and they have these a combination of all of them and human stylus to figure out what's the best address or whatever for you I think was talking about their approach you could most people in time recommend a lot of people I think when they see a compartment this maybe are tempted to do all human or a all computer just completely a kind of you know Pandora Style Just brute recommendation that I know they enter they do some give me or kind of just have a stylus go to
 a lot of money interest I was just really really hard to figure out what the balance is so I know it really extinct is at the sound like a lot of other companies where the training might be done by humans but the computer still does the output the selection in this district is case a human actually picks the final address or whatever they're sending to your clients which is really interesting so I think that flips the conversation it's basically instead of saying how do we kind of just allow computers to better do kind of recommendation to utilize computers to better at this than that in the conversation that kind of mindset is really interesting I think the probably won't work in every case but I do think it's very underrated and I think there's there's a lot that can come out of that kind of symbiosis 0-2-1 he talks about human-computer symbiosis and he emphasized
 underrated idea how how should more people be focusing on how to keep the human in the loop during a machine learning or data science process rather than revenge is automating everything yeah I think the biggest thing is remembering to attend the day you're building a product to solve human problems so I think the focus should be on how do we solve that human problem as effectively as possible and then these and kind of you know like human training these are all just different tool to accomplish that I think that's the best way to poach something is it is not to say like oh you know maybe people have been doing this thing manually for so long that's kind of like the typical like it's like or dislike job sucks that it's boring or whatever have you automate it right then it's it's kind of wrong kind of misguided
 I think in many cases most of work is completely unskilled so you're an elevator operator I mean you know there's there's not really like a lot of computing power than you know but I think it is a lot of jobs were tripping out how to make us more efficient more kind of conversant and just more productive in general I think that's that's like how you think about the problem and instead of saying like Okay how do we get to replace human judgment or you know whatever you use out of those two for example cut down the sea know the number of dresses is estella's have to pick from 1000 to 10 because he was really interesting to as if you were to build the opposite were you actually had like you know if you mind picking some but then computer still make the final decision I think the computer would actually perform vastly worse as you can even just a business decision
 you can say that then the day a human looking at it and picking the dress hour or whatever is like it it's just like getting it right is just what some of my do us that it's like wired kind of risk or why I'm allowed the computer to do it when the air right is in most cases going to be higher the notorious problem of recommendation systems called the cold start problem what is the cold start problem
 so the culture problem is is definite Taurus and recommendations of some Biz it's also very kind of a Taurus in data science in general right so you want to build a new kind of data science product usual you need a lot of data already right said that's like the interesting Catch-22 it's it's kind of like the chicken or egg problem in social networks. It is very similar to sew Netflix Ultra Stitch fix work on this case anyone to recommend clothes or movies to people and a lot of recommendation engines is a tool technique old collaborative filtering kind of look at joint purchasing decisions that people have made love to use it or similar so they made kind of they might like some more stuff if you don't have any user data how do you know like which two uses of similar how do you know kind of like what what they both might like I think that's
 best over-the-ear equitation endurance the secret that's usually the hardest part it's like how do you get recommendations to someone when they're the first person of the 2000 person right right takes usually takes a thousand Millions recommendations to really gets connect to Amazon Netflix scale to give the rotation problem
 I think I think this ties into their human-computer symbiosis approach where I'm guessing the early days more and more reliable a lot more the human element and said like they would have the human stylists actually going to pick out the dresses and they would have the survey that they would give to people like new customers really expensive surveys to combine the outputs of the survey to combine their the judgments of the final decisions that's a stylus made and then overtime figure out how to kind of codify that how to build a time machine learning models out of that I think that's generally that's generally like the best approach this the kind of just observe you have to basically find a way to collect that data I need to be kind of letting people do construction Discovery so maybe you're the only reason Netflix or you were just like like just searching for movies whatever eventually they add the recommendation engine
 because they had the date and they wanted to prove Express it's like someone somewhere here where maybe you you weren't that did informants beginning and then you kind of overtime figure out how to feel better okay one thing that Brad from Stitch fix said that was interesting was he said that an aptitude for framing problems is as important as the technical skills themselves and this is something that your colleague Vic said in my discussion with him he said it's often not so hard to figure out how to find the answer to a question as a data scientist the hard part is finding what question to ask is this consistent with your experience when you're doing data science
 yeah I agree a lot with that and I think you know Douglas Adams from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy you this news the best right with this kind of ending ending part I mean it's it's so true if you can imagine a company like Facebook end of the book they ask they ask it like what is the meaning of life or something I just as 42 it's about time to take away from the book A stay still that is that like the ants look framing the question is a hard part 1 seat frame a question the right way the answer is actually easy just look really I think you can probably apply this to end I think definitely and data science when you have dementia complex Facebook would have just had a virus probably exabyte of data right like the hard part is not hiring people to just kind of willy-nilly Come Thru the data
 never be able to hire enough people to just kind of analyze every date of when every pattern you know it's more of a big knot what signal from the noise it's more of like to know what day does actually important actually drives results what actually affects the Sun is setting especially the kind of quote on quote big data error I think the problem training problem solving aspects days outweigh the kind of Big Data engineering aspects over there at least as important as that was not the case I think they're still like they're still your husband so much time to tools weren't good enough where you could actually kind of focus more on the science I think but now you know catching the tools of gone pretty good supports the focus on breathing problems or whatever
 Kafka Harley to deal with the problem of
 when a user makes an update to their profile how do you propagate that change to other aspects of the system and today would be like what that doesn't sound difficult at all and unable to maintain consistency among the user's profile and the search engine and different ranking algorithms and stuff that's that's not really a problem these days because we have Kafka at Adam and so now that we have cough but too now we can ask the interesting questions so what is the question so you know in the past I can kind of see what you're saying maybe we weren't thinking that because of LinkedIn I think like you know what is that that quote about how I look Necessities like the other invention totally like sores to come. LinkedIn and Facebook and in a Google even right like that's that's totally that like totally in line with that principle Google recently open-sourced tensorflow
 the machine learning library we did a show about this with Greg Corrado from Google as a data scientist who is on the outside of Google
 why is tensorflow important
 it's really interested tense of Floyd think I think the reason tense flows interesting is it's it's you can think of it is kind of like like what sport did for her to do right so yeah I do but this giant thing was like really hard to install and then the oldest companies that pop up around it they have left is Loosely based disconnected ecosystem of products and services stuff of that huge kind of code base that can I stop and think that's kind of like what I think that is the wrong tense of will play and kind of the machine learning and you know some days it's just it is a kind of unified abstraction for working with machine learning models and I think what's so interesting that they just unify so many Concepts so they have like I know Spotify has that open source project Luigi for Dana pipelining ex and I think you tensorflow because of its the way it's set up is deaf
 could take over some of the stuff that Luigi does kind of building date of pipelines if it's kind of extended it's not there yet but I think the way they've architect of the product to be this kind of abstraction Rican kind of it's not really people talk about it like it's a deep learning Weber I think that maybe underscores how interesting it is it's really that's like saying spark is just like a I don't know Big Data library or something like that just something really it it's like a general extraction of just kind of running machine learning models it makes it really really easy free to write your own models specify kind of complications in order of complications as part of their directed-acyclic-graphs they've done a lot to just to make it modular reusable scalable they have the kernels for different kind of devices and platforms it's really too well thought-out kind of engineering more blood
 which seen some machine learning libraries in the past there's baiano and torch how do these things compared to tensorflow why was tensorflow such a breakthrough above these yeah I think those libraries I will tear still really good Sad Piano is actually one of the authors of piano is one of the creators of Dano is one of the co-op in so like you know it was kind of like maybe they were scratching their own age in the sense of Life they can I saw the limitations of the stuff I think it's trying to unify the different kind of approaches I think the main differences are that like piano the others care off there's this question of four or five of these
 a lot of them are still pretty focused on I mean machine learning algorithms deep learning that kind of stuck around making that like a much easier to do it but like piano or kerosene production is non-trivial it is quite a bit of work it's just not I still think those price still see those Parks as science products like the kind of sore researchers by researchers can babies like are a little bit of can apply statisticians for statisticians that is very similar it's just like you don't see people who made it work but they say there's a still there's a lot lacking it's not travel to make it work within a data center it's not real to make it scale and I think the question is like how long the support will be like I was back by Google right and I think it's like it's here to stay
 I think the shortcomings will be kind of worked out the exponent podcast did a show about tensorflow and in that show the host Ben Thompson who also writes the strattec reblog if you heard of that he he argues that Google open sourced tensorflow simply because they have the most data and therefore they can leverage tensorflow the most so they might as well open source it to the rest of the community and let the community aggressively updated I don't know enough about data science and machine learning to know if this is a accurate narrative It's seems pretty cynical is this accurate that you think this is accurate
 well
 I think I think it's it's mostly Akron the sense of like getting a little bit to the cold start off right like it's not like I'm building the recommendation engine is not building a good one that works well the solve the problem very well it's really hard to do I'm just kidding but it is because they know when you're searching something you can be pretty far off it's pretty crazy how Google still kind of knows what you're searching for and that's not because of some kind of unique algorithms if they have OK Google search team is not very well for not actually being that kind of machine learning driven like a lot of their the way they do things is with human training and if it's kind of
 well now that they're not looking its people able to the bin for example uses more she doesn't really matter in science what people really want I think. That definitely Trump's the models I think the real reason open source this because they want to one is it's great example if you want to work like Google is like the place to go right into something people criticize was Apple Apple for which is the way more secretive Etc top Aries tree maybe less inclined to go to a place like apple because researchers really liked open source stuff back to publish stop a lot just a lot of aspects of machine learning at scale that I don't think who else is going to solve magically by themselves but keeping everything a secret so
 example right like the cost of Nvidia gpus and the dominance in like the Deep learning space General I think that goes to show just how important these other companies and other related Industries are a great friend video that my hopefully help Drive the cost down when he fused with the benefits of their contributions to open sources what is it like hardware specs for doing a high or something like that you know about that and how significant that is
 yeah I am. I have not read that much into it but Facebook has been really good about open source. Where you can actually go out you can download a cad model of their Data Center and you can actually get like the same data center infrastructure for you and I think I don't know much about what exactly it is but I do think it's I think like open source is very
 yeah it's it's it's really good when you think about Craigslist mission of making the world more transparent rightly if the company is not transparent then I think I think he's kind of Open Source part of the reason Facebook was able to maintain such a great kind of caliber of engineering that's like Facebook is like we're cutting edge like deep learning stuff so speaking more about like tensorflow in in practice in the interview with Greg Corrado he talked about how tensorflow allows users to deploy machine learning models to a user's phone is this anything new or is this is it is the new aspect here just the way that tensorflow does it
 I sent a it's definitely not the first time you can run Mission Valley Mall on your phone Android like these these Frameworks have machine learning ladder is just if you want you to slow down your phone is not the first time you can do it shows the power of tensorflow which is basically like you know you're not making like the piano and then porting it to mobile or kind of making a separate you know me I know what the mobile version of Seattle or something right tense of blow your life like I think what I think it's to prove a point in my opinion we won't be using phones at least something else like you can just swap it out just like the corner and then no wall are most of the things before work and I think
 I think that's the point with With It Go thing though is that it's one thing to see extraction and just pay the balance on what like a framework second thing is I think we will see more slowly we will see more being done as we get more towards VR AR that kind of stuff where it's more real time you may not really want to wait to get them all up to it in the back end I know like Mexican Google pull tab products produced is a huge phone device physically huge or in terms of like the capacity I mean like I mean both full physical
 it's not like a part of just go by it's not really meant for all right now it's basically like they took a wife life or not they okay with that but I'm still not sure there's a lot of cases that really benefit from being on the phone as you probably know all that great so I am still a little skeptical that there's a lot you can do with the right now but I think I think it's just kind of fat on the picture with it
 I have not personally myself since been on my to-do list but I have spoken to quite a few people who have clean some research it at Stanford and whatever and you know how most people they have said that like yeah like I'm going to explode like for everything but there's a lot of people who are for quite long on the floo know it's going to be supported hopefully I guess you know that's like it's it does seem by promising even though it does have Nelson Performance for coming can't really do stuff like this tribute keep running yet
 it will become very awesome conversation towards you been there for the beginning you could listen to the show you've been you know what does from the start so you know what what can listeners who you know baby I just listening sometimes but are not you know heavily involved in the community is there a reason that they should you know join the slack channel for example or follow us more closely on Twitter or like I have you gotten anything unique out of the community or do you mostly just get value out of the podcast
 there's been a lot of the community for sure I think just getting even closer to you and Renee has been has been great but I think you would more just surveying it's really kind of interesting to see if it's almost stopped and share printer by trade that's not really my background made you write software but it's so it's really interesting to see what they decide stop puking and it's really itching to see what like what interests op enchants what kind they have what how did they see data science and what are they just kind of point of people who have a level of interest in Trust
 Royal have a shared experience of listen to podcast we got do we have things to talk about together I think the most important thing is just kind of ideas are exchanged you know I just like people who want to discuss papers it's just kind of the second natural kind of like chowder board if you will look like what's going on what's interesting what are people's different perspectives on stuff seeing people like different people's reactions the same thing what are you even like you know you within certain industries let you know there's a lot of things but a lot of benches I don't know about so there's a Facebook friends with some of the guys I've liked so I can I think that attachment in of itself stuff like to see more like it's if if you had a vision if you can spend like 15 minutes and you're like you've got 15 minutes I've got two million dollars to allocate towards towards software engineering daily
 where would you like to see it go what would you like to see more of or is there a limitation to how much time you want to spend thinking about software engineering on it on a daily basis
 I think I think the most interesting thing is how do we
 I just want Foster better discussion amongst kind of subgroups right now it doesn't OK job with this is to not really great at handling kind of smaller discussion yeah you can make a channel fine you know really cool like to have like music someone to happen is a little bit where you know it looks like something happens like someone exposes some there no staying or Jeff Bezos to something interesting and people like seeing people's reaction and just discussing it is really interesting but that used to be great on a chant is no longer the case let's just don't really feel like, going to use anymore and you'll still have anything in common I don't think you have anything in common with the other it's so big now the community so big that it is just kind of dislike faceless Avatar Network kind of I don't know
 respect and mutual trust that I think you know I see daily can definitely kind of keep going cuz I just Community feel kind of ways to build a smaller temporary group search may be moving away from slack entirely made $200 I would like to build my own kind of community software that was like a hundred percent focused on the needs of a text and images. How do you know have like a little I don't know Periscope video stuff just along more forms of discussion besides text is really interested in me maybe like product I should be looking at ya
 even though I think same dad same as you're there too which is like it's just like thankful that you have like you like say who you are so I just like random people random usernames so maybe that's why they saw that would identity a little bit but yeah thanks for coming out to software engineering daily this was really interesting talking to you you are a valued member of the community so so so thanks for coming on totally enjoyed it

Transcription: Eli Collins is the chief technologist at Cloudera Eli thanks for coming outside now I know we got offices all over the world our mission is help organizations Leverage The Power of all other data so we're a software company with that in with Philips alligator he said that Hadoop has more knobs and more parameters to tune that he would prefer does Hadoop have an excess of configurability say it has an excess I think it's it's had an excess of user-facing complexity and one of the reasons I don't we created cutter manager before 5 years ago was 280 from from the user to some extent if you've got a complex distributed system you know it was a lot of attributes that you had in the old school parallel
Computing an HBC environment it is fundamentally a complex environment and you know removing the complexity and so you know I think what people wanted is to feel the. Something else that complex be doing their part of your fashion and so that's in between business teams and data science teams to someone in a data science team is someone who understands a little bit about the business to Maine you know a bit about statistics for engineering in their inherently interested in solving problems that are interesting to visit set of if I speak for our own internal data science team that tackles kind of clatter is data problems
your day today in a grateful for all of our customer data it which we use for practice and predicted support for the business and that is a schemer really you know they're really gelled is the process they are like in Cloudera the most dog food with the product Oh yeah this is the so we dog for the product in the number of areas this is the part of the company where if our own software failed we are facing some of these would fail so we treat this cluster I discussed her is a AZ user-facing production environment and we actually upgrade with our latest fist before we get from the customer is kind of the last stage of of looking at a release before it goes out the door but yeah this is cluster goes down it's it would be Bad News Bears for
it also has a lot of customers has a password data so we have to secure it in and treat it as you would any production cluster a product changed since the founding of Cloudera original company was to do actually I do pheasants cloud service that was clutter was founded with that premise it was called CCS platter child services in 6 months we did it into what we do now which is providing a Hindu base data platform and obviously a Chase services like Professional Services training and support and so on how to do pin Pagan Hive and now we've got 25 so mod components in the platform we've got in a proprietary cluster management tool called Fire Manager I dated management tool Navigator
give me the toll for provisioning on the cloud and tell him to his throne that did the basic thesis of a large an interesting open-source platform plus Jason management is been the same for thanks Encino 2009 worries probably the wrong word but do you think about the fact that had you as a service may shoehorn you into a certain category if the world moves in the direction streaming old is today if you use her our product you can do streaming through something else Park screaming which is a screaming interface to spark and we've been shipping spark of it for sure so sorry the Creator spark with her our first ensuring intern we've been shipping it for a while we have a lot of customers using any streaming is one of the cases
we see for Sparks obviously the kind of interactive in in memory on a Lexus is one piece is probably you know a couple dozen people using it just dedicated for screaming we've been shipping after years of Skeeter streaming to get is with getting a ride back and wagon full of data plus multiple were close on the data has stayed the same in every year we were closed so we had it that's the videos of Hadoop is that it's where we know we had this kind of architecture it's like a database and that you put your data in it last you the units for processing. Detected like an operating system so I can you know I can have multiple file system options if I swallow I don't have to in a replacement processing and I can add a new processing engine without throwing up my data Repository
meaning of a daily basis of vertically integrated tightly coupled system where the storage and processing and query language in meta data repository all bundled into one thing you don't really get to decouple them from you can be beautiful because then you can swipe a new component for processing comes along you'll have to throw out the rest of your stat you know you'll have to rethink the way that you store data ingest it secure and so on it so you don't get this project you know it we normally have some thought the rule 3 there's typically at least three of his her project competing for a given type of spot in the platform competition allows you know to to improve over time and we can pick the best ones and people because it's an open-source platform people can choose components that are not part of the platform is still in the wrapper it's so could you describe an example of that rule of three specific if you take a look at you know he likes park storm Sandy
Firestorm Sansa and there's no I think a couple couple others as you know as well but that you that's that's a perfect example of it okay Church of the stream versus batch thing I want understand that a little better streaming Fashion Show streaming in-dash are necessary to stream processing is just saying when people talk about patch they're really complaining a couple things I want is that you ingest your data and batches and so it actually is streaming data point of sale transaction from a large retailer transactions are happening all the time people slapping their credit cards that support Apple Store like like all the data from all the POS point-of-sale machines in that store and then in a batch upload all that data for like the last hour or the last you know 12 hours to Central
and that repository is Zen getting batches from all around the world and then we processes. Two batches in you know now we can freak nipple tally up all of the transactions for giving day or given. Of time but it's fundamentally streaming it's only through the implementation of how we decided to choose to process it that way that we patched it up instead of to me screaming means actually processing the data in the Streamline fashion Horsley you decide to process it what do you do at one transaction time or as 10000 transactions at a time like your backside this is an independent it's always the one of the interesting things about spark-streaming is he actually Implement stream processing just by rationing down to that size so that the best size is small enough that you're at your processing on the order a second batch are not these orthogonal things they're just opposite Inns along great
I need an interesting bit about screaming is not is is that it's more naturally fits the way that is created it so to me it is really more about the architecture of how you're moving data through the system to the TV streaming yeah obviously it's great to get results faster and that's why it's some level it's it's going to be opposite of action that you can you know people often as I'd be screaming systems in terms of you know from the from the time I eat in my business in Jasper crazy piece of data how long does it take for that data to show up in the dashboard to show up in the shop take to show up in the recommendation engine someone screaming is just trying to remove all the friction so that the pipelines in a data data data system just don't end up using and latency inside of you know if you think about something like a user clicking side effects like generates a message you know that click should seamlessly move through this
and end up the process of it maybe that you know it still takes orders in minutes to to update all the universe systems but we haven't duplicated 50 times and adjusted and then create all this complexity have to like write 4 in logic how did you offer it for his back files and so on you know what does the cost structure look like like if I want to go from having several of my data ingestion process is being bashed to just having this constant updated the constantly updated stream dashboard you know beautiful system going what like how many orders of magnitude am I going to have to pay higher in order to get it that from the batch the back side of the gradient to the streaming site of the gradient I don't think Miss Alaska cost anything more it's just a different architectural for a suit sit for example we might have some people who were saying you know both exporting dinner from a data warehouse into a doofus
dedication faster than processing it and then that's when metaphor in uniform sampling day another one is someone is using cough guy with his pops up messaging system and then processing the messages that come up to the Costco Sparks screaming anymore I mean you're just using a different combination of of projects in the platform but it's more expensive it's just a different different way of our connecting it to the platform it's totally valid there a lot of places that are batch that probably should be screaming near they were just batch because there are ancillary reasons that causes a 2-2 fertile won the most common reasons that data is batch process is the cow says oh you know I like this is a precious resource and I'm going to control when the data is exported from the systems I've got you know 500 Business users who have a mission critical function it's great that you
what's the date of the system but I'm going to do a batch export of the data in this Warehouse you know it midnight or 9 p.m. when my user's aren't using it more than you pulling it in real life you should the caption pulling in every change that data warehouse has it happens and so you know that that's really a business decision to choose to prioritize and a protecting that precious expensive resource versus doing the screaming I don't we both models and it's really that's the beauty of his business chooses what's the right model for them and sometimes it says screaming one sometimes it's model model of contribute to open source where they describe how come when is huge contributor to the open source Community if you look at that 20 some-odd projects in the stack I think he founded 13 of them in a 75 80% of our engineering
time goes into writing open source code the fundamental you know what we were the first company to shoot the shipping did you just review session were the first company ships for the first Company open source system we've been deleting any of his her space for a while actually growing substantially dinner portion of our are Kobe stats that is because it's time for us to fly from is a hundred percent open sores and we end up kicking boy's in the platform grow every year as we keep adding projects we keep creating projects versus is what in 75 to 8% of our Engineers do every day where I'm going to platinum level sponsoring the Apache software Foundation many of us myself included or actually members of the PMC the patchy new project at the SSI many of us working the open source community
response if you want to say you know could a large financial services company and say hi to help you you know take this platform in production to do better for protection people behind the pot for understand how it works and you know can you know address road map gas since you have extra local bugs in a matter of hours you know it's it's a really building a business card Eric decide what open source projects to contribute to create a project because we don't see something it's in the ecosystem I'm in there other other examples where there's just projects in the ecosystem that that are great and we contributed does and so it's really more of a function of the division of of what we want in our platform and I talked about to come to share data layer with multiple work clothes so you can go to flush out with that looks like an existing project
LinkedIn had this problem filter really nice system open source did we started using it in contributing to a we recently I get out one of her developers be in Philly at 47 on customers running it before we officially added for the platforms are very kind of working with it for us it was a combination of there's a gap in the platform it's a project to customers developers at our customers want to use rest of the developers of these Rays companies were shooting Kafka sounds good because it's enough that's how it works and then they do they wanted us you know we got feedback from the end of this is something that day and I'm considered to be part of our platform and they wanted to kiss him as part of it and we thought there were a lot of sense to just because it integrated so nicely with old not just you know one or two things would allow the things we're doing a combination of the platform
Warner passed three different variants of everything in the bathroom says is it a guy is it something that has an active developer community that that looks to be thriving it doesn't look like it's going to be a standard like you know within a couple quarters every other hoopsisters distribution decided to ship spark you know other companies do you want that opens for the we don't want the popcorn to be unique to us we want to have active adoption of of all the components of the platform so we can still be care about the ecosystem of adoption for several notches to other I do vendors but is vs another partner is you know we want them to build against the flash BFDI tool in ETL tool Bixby an application for example like em and Doc switches does billing systems for tacos do they are product is embedded in their product it'll be one of them
music capabilities narcotic as we had them to there's a number of factors that go into that is it ever like Cloudera manager decide to buy Fiat we need Engineers to jump on this or is it more of an organic process where you have engineers in the company they're saying what we need we should be doing this and they just migrate towards the park towards the project part of that is just very very engineering heavy organization write him in again like in the size of the company two projects that we created because in the typically this project actually come by enough from from engineering so it is it's not that management isn't aware of the gas
I'm in so you know for example look at those projects you know when they're very early you know we know the community so the decision to put it into the product is normally kind of a foregone conclusion like I said we've been working with spark for years before we decided to ship it as part of the products it wasn't you know it was kind of like about you know we all got in a room that one time is it over and we're going to do this it was something that we had kind of been growing incrementally don't see it because you don't have visibility to the technology their building and house right now I take 2 or 3 years to develop something before they watch it for us that's just more visible because these projects are out their attention and being used and it really do wrist it really dearest the practicing for ISO Kafka it wasn't something me to say maybe it will work
really awesome user in LinkedIn you know value in the technology I really defining some the initial requirements we had customers were adopting it and using it with our platform bed early adopters before it was built into the product gives us a lot of insight and how it's going to work what the gaps are in a sweep in focusing alone security for Costco because that was something that you know that the people lived in weren't working on it as soon as I was critical of our customers sometimes like Kafka into a conversation about about other managed Big Data providers so Kafka there's recently and I don't know how recent was Star Trek concept to Creation process like for some of these if I'm a new customer and my platform by using Kafka or I'm using my own Kafka and I want to migrate to Confluence version of Kafka what is that process like
show me the only given Apache release who were running coffee and house because there will be no there was no one providing aside from the cop videos of elephants are afraid it's not you know we might have some patches you know pay somebody texts you never tell from a release Council if they have some to get open source project for Costco in so there it's not you know it's not very hard to switch between different different builds of it broad software development site and click software development practices like with the word agile right is kind of it say
the word agile came into use probably no lagging the actual implementation of agile buy some company so interesting or unorthodox software engineering practices within Cloudera by by the same token like you guys doing in about much the biggest differences between us and like a traditional platform company is because we're because we have an open-source platform there isn't one methodology for the product red so you know we build software in one way for one project to another project with another team might do it slightly differently because again it's another it's another project it says there is some commonality between you know Cloudera Melvin but there is a bit that's kind of / / project as well in general you know I think the agile methodology applies a lot less to platform technology than two applications so fruit
if you think about features that were doing like oh you know should we encrypt day that you don't need to do that I can guarantee that we're going to wanting for failed to do that and I don't need to revisit that decision every two weeks makes a lot of sense when I think you have any kind of contract type work in an application where the user made credibly come back and say all this was important and now this is important that's less important like you know two three four quarters out of sandwiches are so I don't go outside it might be idling that we were developing a temperamentally work for shipping a feedback
refrigerant in user you know after 4 After 2 years who ever worked for constantly doing that were constantly shifting or possibly getting feedback but we're not really I don't think anyone does popcorn technology is really does agile Dustin of Open Source contribution then some sense of clothes Source mechanisms for interacting with that open source technology and
plenty of companies that adopt something some surfaces strategy that looks something like this in a different context but I was kind of maybe the originator of this like a combination of open sores and cold sores but you know now we're getting to like the extreme of Tesla open-sourcing how do you draw the line between what is useful technology to open source and what should remain closed Source open source in the management of proprietary that's not believe customers are going to adopt a proprietary platforms restore your data how you process a query in Santa run that just doesn't make sense to jahi proprietary you know that you're just going to get out competed in to look at that you know if you take a look at the technologies that are that are really getting a lot of investment and created by yeah what are tokens for project
economy like a LinkedIn a Twitter or Facebook Yahoo Etc you know what are the things that we've done for ages is actually one of the earliest 4-Digit decisions that we make it is that we're trying to build the technology makes this consumable by Enterprises in production right in a hundred people every year you can consume the stuff ready and scale and me to build a custom infrastructure for a configuration deployment monitoring it so on I want to do that very few. Global 2500 Enterprises want to do that so we focus on building Enterprise software to make the core platform technology consumable by advisors Enterprises that's not being there's no open source development in that area by their traditional large internet companies
are brassicas originally course EDH it was hard to configure to play that manage a manager why because they did all this year they built all this out but no one had felt kind of pieces for the other other bed so that's that's that's set you know that we built how much is leading indicator of the way other Industries are going to go look at Frito-Lay at their Factory Technologies is John Deere going to open source how their tractors work if you confuse him back basically saying there's a set of things that we develop and we have a trade-off we can make that thing you need to us the only ones working on it we can get off this technology with a group of people and it will no longer be nice and so you know going back to her like why do we have is this is hungry
delete you need to discuss his mama why didn't you have your proprietary software companies who their technology. It is completely you need to know right the only place you can get along because you're right I didn't go and say oh yeah and so what we've tried to do is have a balance we're staying warm versus necessary to out-compete the aggregate open source ecosystem for platform technology and I think that analogy to where the people producing the technologies that you know you're his dork might have fun this directly monetize at 10
Jake and if the five of us were together we could probably do a better job than any one of us will do it alone and that's actually going to drive this the Jason thing that we do monetize anytime you had that you're seeing people effectively open source you know what it whatever it is you're doing it in the soccer World that's that's the future It's a combination of a oatmeal a powerful open-source standard Plus account you should look at you out right it's which is open source project very powerful standard that we all use does a proprietary thing that helps make it actually usable to two lots of people you know you can share a ride to the company because otherwise you have you know you have no you know you're you want to provide if you don't just want to just review everything you want your engineers to be working on making that thing more valuable than usual
optimal to do the rest of the world an estimate get itself a lot more viable right that's what we've been doing the Powerball on the open source project
 the first week of software engineering daily was about JavaScript and there was this Motif that I encountered which was the amount of collaboration among large companies there was teamwork between Microsoft and Google on angular 2.0 and there was teamwork between Facebook and apple that work on react together and so is the story of collaboration like the increase of collaboration is this an industry-wide thing that's happening or is it just something that's always been like what do you think is the Continuing Story of collaboration among the large tech companies among the producers of the technology and there's also the collaboration among the consumers in the producers of the technology we all can focus on collaboration of The Producers the collaborations the producers and consumers
 you know published and then I was going to fly versions between can multiple producers and that is even if that is I think that's reflective of a larger product development rent which is saying you know it's not sit in the cave and going to build this one thing and isolation and then, throw it out in the world systems are so big and complex that let's think about them up into individual pieces and being far more iterative with how we launching in integrate those pieces inside Anytime you see an ecosystem that has that's a large complex ecosystem that you can decompose into individual pieces you're going to start to see this working model of let's stop getting these giant bee-like let's not produce those things by giant corporations working in isolation let's produces
 by decomposing the system into considering parts and then having collaboration and competition on this parts
 engineering principles that I was interested in the first one second one is containerization how is Cloudera using containerization services like Docker containers virtual machines are coming in my in my DNA that really Google I had been pioneering recently and you know could you please based on a lot of Google Google's GFS mapreduce papers and the fundamental unit evaluation from getting one in produce has been a nice container so when you went away to look at it because we take a cluster we chop it up into containers and then we alligators containers two jobs so you know the
 Havertys cool bases had the Lakes container executor for ages and sit with doctors really doing is making Linux containers more usable to developers by allowing them to compose environments in those containers containers usable by developers by just allowing them to write for keppel high job as we take care of setting up the containers containers for ages and Potter manager makes it very easy containerization easier for Caldera in Docker images and what doctors been really great for is making art form or consumable quickly by developer so so we've always a virtual machine image with her. When we do a release so that someone can run to be on their on their client and start playing around the technology you connect me to remove cluster whatnot
 we started Hall of Shame more and more of our of our software in Docker images as well so it because that's really the way a lot of developers one night so if you want to kick the tires on Impala connected to remove cluster in a you just pulled it at the doctor about Imogen Poots that's nicer than pulling the virtual machine image for testing just want to launch your own hbase cluster you know on on one machine to try to test the various configuration options really need to run it on 5 different machines or 5 if physical pieces of Hardware to do a lot of Depends basic testing that requires watching the concert so we can launch in hbase cluster on one machine with 22 Peter 1-20 clusters with 20 different parts of the configuration space turn down very quickly much faster than the clap
 versus VMS you could contrast how heavy is a VM instance versus a Docker images if you think of her all Linux process or operating system process on one side and you can think of the other as a full virtual machine on the other there's a there's a Continuum between those two spaces depending on how much you Sharon how isolated you are a virtual machine is completely isolated and you know that provides the full extraction of a machine the next process has the weakest form of of isolation and sharing if you want to create a process versus read it seems asking to some call it gives you the exact same schedule as an address base a thread is just two processes that she's sharing an address base in Lenexa additional isolation layered onto its if you think
 you know all the parole Linux process than a Rolex process running in a lettuce container like us to get it running and skirts all the way down to dr. you know dr. is actually just an interface for using the underlying Lakes container technology Universal machine is just a Amor fully-blown version of that and so I think one of the things that we we've known forever is that there's certain environments their pros and cons to all these to all these environments like there's things were you want to use wrap Rasta Cesar sings read all these doctors really done I think his wishes been great is your show is really make the space of container is accessible to a lot more people so weird
 and I give me a message implementation Detail Doctor Who really allowed developers to Curtis containers directly and I think they're kind of proved that there's just a lot of Value Inn
 that's great so Moore's law has been used to articulate the speed at which technology is exponentially increasing but it's you and I could be wrong about this have to Benchmark if we develop a new technology that allows us to break up our tasks in a more logical fashion or that uses resources more effectively that has nothing to do with increased processor speed but it does result in a technological advance so do you have anything on you agree with this and do you have any suggestions for different benchmarks that people can use to identify how fast are world is exponential advancing transistors 18 months for doubling the number of transistors
 processors which is what you think of this processor speed is getting a divorce has a number of benefits and we can watch your language is that the clock frequency of chips has not been doubling every 18 months so you know I recently ordered a bunch of machines and I think they had 3.4 gigahertz and 3.4 gigahertz socket socket so she's actually going up every 18 months but I think that you're saying is that there's a lot in this is just something that we benefit from a clatter obviously being a parallel I did a processing system is a new friend works at wind in the future or the Frameworks I can leverage that parallelism because of the chips aren't getting whole lot faster
 Fred basis but we are again I just bought a machine with 36 quarters in a 72 threats that's that's not to be in one machine then the entire rack of power Google had when they publish the Google papers that someone had heard about the garbage truck videos cars clacker I like the language go has he been developing and Joker lism was relatively limited but you know we see the world now like I just been massively massively parallel and that's going to change your number thank you might have to running along machine in the same time for job was saying that was a lot right when we are running apps on a cluster
 I wasn't as always running on the cluster and that's just the world we live in today in the beauty of the United leave work on the right side of technology did you know everyone is going to even a single machine is going to be able to support thousands of Tas so you know today if you know maybe we're doing that on same server cluster but you know that's going to be that we're already kind of a line with in Wicked Weed increasingly do you work to support because that parallelism is just going up and up enough to visit technology technology Claudius and Have We Become decoupled from the past notion where oh yeah we've got this every 18 months we're going to double and everybody in the industry is going to move in lock step towards this and everybody else Works in lockstep to synchronize around that time frame
 automatic we've already moved off of it in the sense that client work is all moved to the browser in Mobile so they don't care about us it's just not going to wait till era the client world really deeply cared about getting faster machines and continue to continue to drop you know Windows has two windows for free to Consumers right Apple does this as well write the market value of pi 3 operating systems has dropped to zero on the side in the server side now is kind of the old full-service side plus the server side that's been generated from everyone on the client moving to you know in this world for awhile wink which is heading yeah hey has applications move to that kind of that model driven by these new types of clients you know we've had to scale out on the server side for a while and so
 bascula is kind of been been our our our our stick for I know I feel like a decade plus now and and so is that world you know it's really you know it's you have a couple of notches see how beef is every machine how many machines you have and so is kind of one half dozen of another right if I have if I buy a hundred machines with 18 quarts per second or if I buy 15 at 200 machines with half that you know it's really about balancing this Holistics out of computer networking memory you care less about what an individual machine looks like
 to the text bubble is discussed a lot and I'm not going to ask whether or not you think we're going to downturn but I'm assuming you are I'm sorry not going to do it whether you think you're some probability of a downturn in the future but I'm guessing you think it's there's some probability that there's some sort of bubble type behavior in that there will be some sort of larger scale downturn if that were to happen if the worst potential future happened in terms of like cloudera's business and a bunch of customers suddenly pulled out I'm sure it's from a engineering standpoint of handling the situation in terms of reallocating the overabundance in processing power that you would have if a bunch of customers just suddenly pulled out what would you do if we were founded right before the financial crisis of 2008
 the day before leaving Brothers went under to hit by the way this is the second time I've lived in 1999 right before the.com crash was working at startup in New York City and then later on I can put something very small and repot forming all of these companies from you know expensive proprietor Like Son Hardware Oracle databases you know proprietary application servers and I started taking them all to blame stack again this is in 2000 and was awesome it was we were we were making money hand-over-fist and just couldn't get up I could go to all these companies in the order of magnitude cost difference between you know a sunny 10K running an oracle box versus a 50
 computer from Dell + my sequel + Red Hats version I mean
 you're just in the in the next life is repulsive open source technology benefits tremendously from from downturns so you know if you look at what we just so you know if you look at us as a company now you are if you look at say on a rental property in a cost to process a terabyte bases word ordering food one order of magnitude or more cheaper than traditional systems people who are using for National systems at say you're twenty-five $50,000 hundred-thousand-dollar ChatterBait you know termite and we're coming in with the system you know where one machine can hold in a 16 18 20 for raw terabytes of storage even more raw 3648 in one machine that's license on a basic happened in the Lehman Brothers time that you are surprised by do you have more customers
 two to start a company just because it's the town pool is you get less competition from the talent pool and you get it companies that are interest more interest in being creative and try and use the macro effect is good and is interesting and it's like ultimately positive but what I'm curious about his perspective all of a sudden you lost a ton of customers and you had all the spare computer resource what would you do with that overabundance so we should go have any we use the public lot quite a bit you know we have a Datacenter that sounds of machines and data center in San Jose the soccer for our customers Baymont or suffer for them in the car but we don't post this offer for the customers and so you know they're their usage of it is that we have
 give her know so I don't worry about our inventory invited by the way the typical server this is your over 3 years after 3 years of Publix out too so we meet you there there's a bunch of elasticity that's not something I worry about you just saying okay
 this number it's like new or data visualization tools is also like Tablo and palantir and some other ones
 what does the future of work look like when we have people who are empowered to make much more refined judgements from data and you have increasingly or decreasing Lee engineering type people who can make an interesting judgements from that data tools to use or analyst for a while so if you look at any insurance for more financial services firm they've been doing this for probably half a century doing fraud Dave been doing sophisticated Cisco analysis of their data driven by the business for a long time that's becoming a lot more analytical tools are very expensive only being offered to people with that kind of detail and pull back around the bi revolution in the nineties was about making a lot of visualization more
 broccoli applicable to the business inside that is Tablo is just the most recent I mean there's towels a recent entrance to the Bi-Mart
 yeah but every major getting his company has pretty much how to be an offering for a while you know we're going to continuing the macro-level changers in self-service bi which is taking the I kind of from this small demand of people who insteon to as many of those people as possible so you can imagine Nina the executive team you know what to look at a bunch of that we used to make decisions about the business successful that date is just accept you know what we're doing internally is the same thing is going on in our wishes everyone is trying to make the data more accessible to more parts to the dentist so they can benefit from it

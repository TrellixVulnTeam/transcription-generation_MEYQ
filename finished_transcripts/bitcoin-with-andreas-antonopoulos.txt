Transcription: Andreas Antonopoulos is a Bitcoin researcher journalist and evangelist Andres when is episode airs software engineering daily is already going to have air in a few episodes about the basic aspects of Bitcoin so I want to skip straight to interesting questions and I am the gloves off because you know you have a lot of strong opinions and Bitcoin as a subject we're strong opinions with a stated degree of uncertainty are not excusable but really valuable and cons of fundamental changed how our world works and we should not be reticent about that so with that said what are the subjects within the Bitcoin community that are most taboo
I think in the Bitcoin Community some of the taboo subjects are really the societal taboos specifically the idea that adds Bitcoin cards some of its early success in areas of Grey economies like gambling and that's a Bitcoin is being driven by in some cases pornography or elicits money transfers of people trying to evade taxes or currency controls in in various countries where where such things are completely out of control I think people are reluctance to talk about the role the grey or black markets play in Bitcoin or at least played especially in the early days
but I think that's really funny because every single technology that's that's ever being disruptive has always had its roots in some of the grain markets in the list of activities that the truth is that in areas of the economy with a friction is greatest where the risks are higher as are the rewards there will be the use of cutting-edge Technology as an advantage so it's not surprising the first telephones were used by criminals the first cars were used by criminals the first you know every every invention that is really change the world's initially is used by segments of the population that are living on The Cutting Edge of Technology pic cause they're on the wrong edge of the law and that's neither surprising nor should we shy away from its and the truth is the truth is the more than half of the word
economy is growing markets and you know those pretty markets are underserved by payments facilities in and money that offers users security and so when you have a system of money that makes it more secure to trade in some of the areas where risks are higher of course people are going to use the more secure money ideas that are taboo from the standpoint of the general public looking into Bitcoin taboos within the Bitcoin community in that people people don't want to talk about the very real fact that when when some County sheriff in Illinois decides to threaten visa and MasterCard and force them to stop serving a website like backpage.com which is been just because I was being in
news recently I'm outside classifieds services that that involves a lot of Paris at Altec tivities most illegal most of which are perfectly legal but yeah this marlesta County Sheriff if he had illegal activity he would have used their brought prosecutorial discretion to go after it but they can actually go after any activity on behalf of Backpage because it's protected by the First Amendment and because a lot of the activity almost activity on the side the perfectly legal but they want to apply certain moralistic Prejudice on to this site you know it it it offends there an arrow sense of morality and and it certainly helps the resume so what they do is extrajudicial e Which Wich you know in this country under the rule of law should be up Horan Swiss all putting pressure on the credit card companies to cut off a business that is doing legitimate business and has never
been convicted of anything for the fact that I got point-of-service turns to bitcoin should not be surprising
 but again you know a lot of people in the Bitcoin Community don't want to talk about the fact that gray markets exist for a reason they exist that either because of the laws being applied on fairly or unequally or because people live in in societies that have oppression and dictators and tyrants and predatory Banks and governments that steal from their people and so gray economies is how they get away from that and it's okay to acknowledge that Bitcoin is a solution for people who live in the gray areas of our world grain markets exist on a totally separate pole van perfectly legal markets or is it some sort of grey in between the two and is Bitcoin a function for reducing the the frictions along that gradient absolutely I mean black markets if you if you like to take the term black market so you could say
 are the illegal term of the illegal side of that term and white Market supposedly are the legal side of the term and putting a sides kind of the racist conversation to the origins of those words the gray is all of the stuff in between which in most cases is perfectly legal or is legal in many jurisdictions you know the stuff that's illegal in some jurisdictions it can be ridiculous you you can't buy video games in some jurisdictions you can do political speech in some jurisdictions you can't buy an apartment without the government taking 60% of the value in packs and so would a person in those circumstances by a bit of a video game with Bitcoin evading the law would a person buying an Apartments transfer the money abroad with Bitcoin to evade the 60% tax or by government that's you know dying of hyperinflation and trying to text everything so you know that these gray areas
 great privilege to live in a world where you have some support of the rule of law & justice system The Classy allow you to live in the White markets and that's wonderful the problem is that the vast majority of the world doesn't live like that and those areas there is tremendous economic friction and there's also the possibility of violence and packed and Bitcoin by bringing higher levels of security two transactions Su removes a lot of those things are removed the possibility of eyelids to remove the possibility of fat and therefore it's a very reasonable and and predictable that's a Bitcoin will flourish first in those areas that doesn't mean it's cute it's specifically to those areas it doesn't mean it's a currency for illegal activities it's a currency illegal activities is something Society does the fact that they use one car in Severson. You know quite honestly every single dollar bill you pick up has traces of cocaine on it because someone are rolled it up and use it to snort cocaine up their nose you know the currency that is promoting most of the
 illegal activity on this planet let's not kid ourselves and see us all or not Bitcoin but certainly the media likes the portrayed as such
 what do you think of when you hear people say the phrase We Know Bitcoin is the first real cryptocurrency but the big question is whether it will be the last
 why I think this is the whole you know Bitcoin is MySpace while his Facebook and first of all the ironic thing is of course the Bitcoin is not the first cryptocurrency the Bitcoin is the grandchild of a long series of cryptographically Base currencies it started almost immediately after the invention of the diffie-hellman algorithm and the rivers Chimney Rock Road public key cryptography almost immediately after that people started thinking of applications of public-key cryptography asymmetric cryptography to the to the concern of money so the mid-eighties we start seeing all of these papers and and prototypes and by the early nineties we see companies like they gcash doing the first forms of digital cash and dozens and dozens and dozens of currencies came and went in that time all of them suffering from a fatal flaw of central is a
 the queen is the first decentralized cryptographically base digital currency but it's not the first digital currency to stop the first cryptographically base currency and it represents the lessons from all of the previous failures will something else come along it's actually quite difficult to bootstrap the car and see and sew in many ways the fact that Bitcoin achieved bootstrap level in the first three years and then survive the next three is is a rather unique moments in history doesn't happen easily it doesn't happen often and the chances of it happening again in the face of much more knowledge about the space is pretty slim so Bitcoin has a compelling early Advantage hear that is going to be very difficult to overcome I think that if something replace is Bitcoin a whoopee because Bitcoin failed from the inside rather than because something better came along a Bitcoin being open source being a dynamic and flexible environment if something better comes along
 is out of the Bitcoin can block that feature and adopt it and then carry all of the existing benefits of network of fact and brought adoption deployed infrastructure massive capital investment two trains developers etcetera that are actually being conceived of what are the biggest questions in distributed systems today and how does that relate to bitcoin
 I mean distributed systems is still a very young science and there and there are enormous questions even even now we're seeing every few months so very important papers about doing things like
 States and quantization among this tributed systems which is a car classic problem in distributed systems which is how do you synchronize information across distances with participants that may come and go they may have non permanent connections attacks may not cross the other parties and then how do you do it to the most efficient manner to reduce the amount of data that is being transmitted between between notes in the system at all of these things are still being research regardless of Bitcoin but what's interesting is that now many of these evolutions and developers are finding very very mediate application and pick one because Bitcoin is distributed systems with the motivation of profit Bitcoin is distributed systems apply to money so the stakes are high the invested money already and the prophet possibilities so there's a lot of companies interested in taking the latest theoretical
 search and applying it in in an industry that is currently growing out of tremendous right systems in a computer science and distributed systems itself seems to succeed as this combinatorial froth of different technologies that are in invented within itself you know you have your paxos and a raft and three phase commit and all these ideas seem to have Synergy is is is the future distributed systems analogous to the the Breakthrough of Bitcoin where much of the future distributed systems is going to be synergies between past inventions with in distributed systems
 I think it's always been like that but I think once more interesting is that a lot of the difficulty in applying distributed systems was creating a platform big enough where you could produce certain distributed system principles or characteristics or artifacts if you like that were emergent properties of the system on a broad scale is interesting because if you look at it just as a currency it's one thing but if you look at it as a platform in distributed systems wire for it actually delivers to the end users who have a public key cryptography infrastructure overlaid on top of it it delivers some very important distributed systems Primitives so the ability to do time Bay sequencing and registration of information and to be able to resolve State complex and all the other capabilities to pick one has within the scripting language all of these have brought up like abilities in distributed systems well beyond the concept of currency so really bit
 when is an appliance implementation of the most cutting-edge Technologies in distributed systems backed by a monetary incentive and game theoretical system of checks and balances that allows you to develop high levels of trust in these are Primitives that are delivered as a network service Primitives of trough such as resolving signatures sequencing transactions atomicity spend ability verifiability unforgeability all of these principles then can be used to to develop higher-order distributed systems applications it is it is the most exciting deep distributed and decentralized systems platform good that we've ever seen and because of the financial incentive in the use of the currency it's spreading really really fast so in fact you know Bitcoin is is rapidly getting to the point where it's going to be the second largest public key infrastructure in the world
 after the dod so it's the largest civilian Department of Public infrastructure which is quite shocking
 Moore's Law is a benchmark of computational Effectiveness that doesn't really make much sense anymore like it seems like you're more concerned with the network as a whole how effective are algorithms did our routing information throughout the network does more is more like a deprecated idea no I don't think so it's just that the Moors law has come to mean more than just Moore's Law ISO Moore's Law as originally situated by Gordon Moore is that the density of transistors on a silicon chip will double approximately every 18 months the more generalized principal of mores laws that computing power doubles every couple of years or is it for the same computing power you pay half the cost so there's the implications of the doubling of transistors and we're seeing that quite solidly in comfortably continuous it's continuing in the labs is continuing in practice
 more importantly are the offshoot of Moore's Law because the ability to pack transistor is usually involves the ability to manipulate matter at the nanoscale which has implications for the ability to create persistent storage mechanisms such as hard drives so then then offshoot of Moore's Law is that because you can pack more transistor is it because to do that you're you're doing a lot of nanoscale physics and nanoscale Engineering now you can build hard drives a doubling capacity every 2 years or sometimes even faster and because he's Electronics of driving fiber optics and the construction of fiber and driving the electronics and Optical interfaces on fiber optics that means the bed with his also growing approximately at the same rights just a bit slower and so really if you take it as a generalize thing which is that Computing technology Communications and storage are all increasing as a great
 more than linear rate is that has very deep implications for how you engineer technology because in many cases is not even worth optimizing certain things if you can simply wait to hear and run its own Hardware that's twice as fast with twice the band within twice the storage so we'll see I mean these are at least have really important implications in Bitcoin in itself because they dress the fundamental issues of scalability and optimization in the Bitcoin protocol how do you take this system that is currently supporting perhaps one or two million users and skeletal point where I can support a billion users before Bitcoin was big data and I did several interviews with people about topics like Pig and Apache spark and Hadoop and what is at the intersection of Big Data Technologies and Bitcoin
 well I is there there is enormous amount of intersection or the commonality between Big Data the blockchain itself is a big data dangerous store it's not only is it in in the gigabytes in size pot if you then extract the information analyze it process it and creates the kind of indexing and meta data extraction from transactions the scripts inside them the addresses and their relationships it quickly explodes to a much bigger data set so if you take the base blockchain of about 30 gig and you analyze that you end up with a beta a data sets in the hundreds of gigabytes and then you can start doing some very interesting analytics on top of that so what else is two things from one perspective what you're doing is you have a big day today to store but it's one that is universal and synchronized across all systems
 call a persistent and trustworthy manner that that's never happened before the second is that for the first time we have insights into economics on a real-time basis every aspect of Economics economics is never really been a hard science because you're dealing with actors or agencies are called an economics were humans making supposedly rational decision but the problem is that you can't really observe these decisions in real-time what you going to do is you can collect statistics and to a margin of error and statistical approximation ex post facto 6 months after the fact you can look at it so what was the velocity of money what was the growth rate what was the demographics of the user is how did these developed how did the markets develop what was Bitcoin for the first time you can do computational macroeconomics in real time you could do macroeconomics and observe the the velocity of money in real time on the network not to a statistical approximation butts in Absol
 terms and you can do that with certain overlays you know if you have data from Merchants for example you can do computational macroeconomics and microeconomics being the study of specific markets within the economy of regions products Industries Etc and again that's something you could never do other than as a looking back in hindsight I to statistical approximation this is really going to bring not just a whole new area of study for Big Data but it but it is also arguably and you discipline an economics it didn't exist before and it's just them that aggressively that are the updates more aggressively in real time
 I think that this is like there's there is a traditional notion in the efficient market hypothesis states that you are getting constant updates to the system which is not really true like efficient market hypothesis is probably more like this eventual consistency sort of thing like maybe the efficient market hypothesis is actually something that's that is going to occur in the future or how do you think that economic system is that contrast with what we what we have referred to in the past as the efficient market hypothesis
 will Bitcoin is a commodity that is traded horribly 24 hours a day 7 days a week which is that in itself is unusual there aren't many Commodities that are traded on a real-time bases around the clock around the world symbol taneously and all of the transactions of visible in real-time the sum of the internals of how Bitcoin works specifically the remaining the mining power and difficulty equation that continuously adjust the difficulty of mining on bitcoin to account for the market size of the miners and to keep stability around a 10 minutes issuance time limit that's that equation is probably one of the most directly observable efficient markets in operation it's it's quite astonishing how how that adjust quite quite officially to changes in the market conditions but you asked me earlier today we talked a bit about taboos with
 the Bitcoin community in the second part I think of your question was what are the taboos in the broader economy about pick one up around just for a second and say probably the biggest taboo we have right now the think we can talk about in Western societies is the fact that the efficient-markets doctrine died in 2008 and that since 2008 we are living in a centrally planned economics environment we have now accepted the ideas of centrally planned economics that with Farley rejected during the Cold War now they are accepted instead of instead of the president's Emperor or a prime minister essentially planning the economy we have effectively an unelected Board of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve chair person and and they are now at all around the world across dozens of central banks they are actively buying equities they are active
 intervening in the markets in order to do what they call Price support which is basically distorting the price Discovery mechanism across the world and they're pouring the most probably in normous amounts of money ever seen by by Humanity as 0% interest free money which in itself causes a massive Distortion in the Investments outcomes Italy's economy is born one bubble after the next this is not normal economics this is you know so let's compare it that some people would say Bitcoin is this radical experimented money of the last 6 years we guess what that's not the radical experiment in money the radical experiments in money is 21 Central Bank setting their interest rates at 0 4 6 years that is the most unprecedented radical experiment in money and that much money experiment has taken a few billion people hostage with it along for the ride without popping a Bitcoin
 you don't want to participate in the crazy experiments a Bitcoin don't buy any but I'm fortunate you can't talk sounds from the dollar to the euro began the Yuan or any of the other crazy monitor experiments happening today in the outcome is not going to be fun
 great so let's talk more about that on the fun out, like what is going to be put it in most optimistic terms let's say we have a eventual migration from from Fiat to crypto currency how will that transition occur will there be some sort of steady-state where we have in a side-by-side these there's some sort of like comfortable exchange rate between the two or is it just going to be like one will suddenly some some conceivable scenarios absolutely I can give you my perspective on this and of course this is all through speculation but here's the point I want the first push back on and that's the assumption that you will have a migration from traditional economies into the new economy of cryptocurrencies this is very much like the question of asking in 1992 how many fax machines will the internet
 replace how many phone calls will eventually be Internet only and the point is it doesn't matter because this is not simply a matter of replacing existing economic activity in one realm with the same economic activity using a digital currency that's the wrong way of looking at it and then in fact it's a common fallacy people who see digital currencies as just currencies don't understand the platform in that turns out most of the economics of what happened on the internet will not replacing existing Industries they didn't make a giant new industry to do long distance phone calls and faxing they represented in tirely you economic activity that had no parallel in the past they represented the development of New Economic growth new opportunity new jobs you industries that had no previous power in the process of several old Industries went belly-up but they weren't replace like-for-like and fox the transitions were rather discontinuous and this is the same as a
 any other things this is not about how many Stables will be replaced by garages and how many Haymarket will be replaced by gasoline fuel when the automobile comes along it redesigns the very Urban landscape living and Indian counting horses and hey really misses the point so we're not going to see you transition from I don't think we're ever going to see a transition from Fiat to crypto currencies at least not in the way we expected rather what will happen is the cryptocurrencies will begin to grow independently of Fiat don't develop their own market dynamics to serve markets that have never being markets that a geographic and demographics such a serving the other five to six billion people who don't have access to international finance of capitalism serving remote and rural areas that don't have access to Perkin border infrastructure but do have access to cell phones serving economic activities that previously did not support the development of infrastructure the friction was too high
 person-to-person trade across massive distances and border is instantaneously new forms of micropayments new products and services a completely new model of the sharing economy autonomous systems that can own and control money independence of people these are the Hallmarks of cryptocurrency in the future and they don't replace be at the activity it's not about doing more of our shopping on bitcoin unless of our shopping on dollars it's about doing things with cryptocurrencies that we could never do before and then at that point you know you exist in a world where there are certain things which the dollar is is the main currency and of course you so probably paying your taxes and dollars and things like that but there's other things that it simply doesn't make sense to use dollars because they're slowing insecure and can't cross board as easily and if you think about that from a Global Perspective then there is a place for Global transnational borderless currencies that is simply not served by
 any currency today and it's so it's not about Bitcoin becoming the world Reserve currency it's about changing the requirements of the world Reserve currency and instead becoming the first online currency in the internet's currency which hospital flag has little country has no borders and is replacing and displacing no one because you simply don't care about that stuff in the end the internet didn't replace fax machines that just made the whole concept kind of quaint and silly
 there should be two rivaling societal factions which create a lot of the noise around the present-day and inhibit a clear true narrative from evolving at least two factions that I see are on one hand you have the Auntie intellectuals of the world who are afraid of Technology because they don't really understand it and then on the Other Extreme there's like this this technocratic Elite which might say Bitcoin is the future and if you don't get it then I do not want to talk to you and between these two sides you said and you tell people look Bitcoin is the future and if you don't get it I'm going to be patient and I'm going to explain it to you do you think that's accurate is that how you see yourself
 I'm not really I mean I appreciate it very flattering what you say but you know people have different skills ride so some people some people have skills they're just incredible programmers for incredible mathematicians or Visionaries in computer science in distributed systems and I I can program I'm a computer scientist saying I'm not very good at mathematics but good enough to be able to explain the concept and you know that's not my strong area my strong area is taking complex things and explaining them in human terms and simple terms of people so I just went with what I was good at Sand try to use that to contribute to the Bitcoin community and do something that I really enjoy because I'm passionate about Bitcoin but it wasn't really in juxtaposition to the technocratic the weeds were doing their thing I use quite honestly without without the people who are too busy building really really important serious and interesting ship I've been would be nothing for me to talk about
 and while I am also doing my own little edge of innovation and Building Things myself you know they're so in Bitcoin there are some people who are just absolutely brilliant brilliant people with Incredible brains who couldn't explain anything to anyone and that's okay because instead what they're doing is is is working and building better solutions for Bitcoin so everybody has their little place function or something this Evangelistic function that you put yourself in cuz I think this is actually super important role like a specially is removed for in the future if Technologies accelerating
 it seems like we're in an increasingly has an effect on abstract technology to have an increasing effect on on the general public there's a bigger and bigger role for people who can translate this obscure technology to the broader public so what are some tips on how you do that
 well at the first of all I've been doing public speaking and teaching since I was 15 years old so I really had a lot of practice and especially with Bitcoin I explain the same things again and again and again to a very broad variety of people from all walks of life on a daily basis so again I can't a lot of practice by the time most of the people here in answer to a question I've heard that question a hundred times I tried to explain it a hundred different times and I found what works so it's a process of trial and error and practice other than that I think it's really important to to do three things the first one is to always remember that are personal experience and I'm speaking primarily of Western Societies or even more so about technologically-advanced male-dominated mostly whites Western societies with lots of young engineering
 like Silicon Valley do not represent the world and do not represent the most important demographics for Bitcoin who are the unbank the underbanked and hopefully those we can soon make D bank and put them directly onto controlling thrown money it's really important to always remember that what's important to me what's important to my peers what's important to the people around me is not what's important to bitcoin because we do not represent we were presented a tiny fraction 5 to 10% of the world's population the most privileged who has the most access to everything and for who money is easy and so it from our perspective is very easy to forget why Bitcoin after all I can do most of these things was with Visa I can do most of these things with of course these eyes and apply formby's I send free Visa isn't decentralized Visa isn't uncensorable but two most American Social marginal thing
 set that really are hard to explain it's not hard to explain economic conclusion that they cannot even explain but they they can into it that they're useful or something like that so what are some of the most bleeding-edge things you've seen in the world recently
 oh well I mean there is so much stuff first of all you got to realize that the Innovation leads the practical application by about 2 to 3 years we're beginning to see now practical application of technologies that with the ballot in 2012 multi signature and hierarchal deterministic wallets and things like that we're beginning to see more use of technologies that have existed for a while that I getting refined and improve like lock Time and Time control transactions on top of these were now seeing some of the new applications coming online and combining those capabilities at one of the most exciting of recent times has being the implementation and demonstration of payment channels for juice in micro payment technology so several companies have now demonstrated prototypes or even fully running systems that can do micro payments for streaming video for example for
 sing some ideas around WiFi sharing and things like that that what's really interesting about this is that were looking at using the building components of Bitcoin to do micro payments down to a time granularity of 200 milliseconds and a payments granularity of 1 Satoshi hundred thousands of a penny think about that for just a moment this is like if you can't come up with world-changing applications when when you have those kinds of tools that kind of platform At Your Service you're not thinking hard enough but
 so there's my car payments and then we'll be seeing interestedly is is a whole other area of research on confidential transactions and advanced kind of contracts and scripts in Bitcoin and the development of side change technology so all of this is still in the very early stages of the height of the theoretical papers have been the first prototype implementation to coming out it's going to take another year or two before we start seeing some of these mainstream implementations but Bitcoin is not the same as it was in 2009 it is changing all the time and the rate of innovation is actually accelerating with more amazing mind blowing things being built on top of a coin
 file storage is another application that we're seeing micropayment channels of course to be used on there's a couple of different approaches to file storage but we're seeing the Bitcoin enables a kind of a Prada platform for decentralized file storing and kind of sharing economy of hard drives with strong encryption with completely decentralized storage and way of Integrity guarantees through registration on the blockchain and there's probably half a dozen prototypes in that space and just whatever speculative guess you are my from having like a Dropbox like a like further from the user point of view you just have like a Dropbox but it would exist on some sort of blockchain related file storage technology therefore will be a lot cheaper more secure
 how about we already have that I mean so the question is do you really need to do the file storage itself on the blockchain probably not what you do is use the blockchain in order to do registration and and asset ownership as well as I key management and distribution what you use similar technology BitTorrent Sync has existed now for almost 2 years and that represents a huge step forward in terms of the centralized file storage so we already have that the question is how many of these applications can we do when a practical sense to abroad public and make these the default applications that are just as easy to use as the centralized Services just as efficient at least and then move beyond that and make them more secure more efficient more performance than centralized Solutions and that's where you start so you start seeing some interesting effects come in
 how do you say 21 ink
 I'm alright I'm not quite sure what 21 ink is going to end up doing or how they're going to do that I am you know acquainted with Balaji srinivasan who's the founder of 21 ink and some of the other principals I know and I think what they're doing is really pushing forward on this vision of Satoshi has expressed in the in the original paper which was one CPU one vote I sent you the trying to decentralize mining whether that's going to be successful where there is a place for that remains to be seen it is still a venture I'm really excited to see kind of that kind of effort and investment being brought to bear on this problem
 is there anything fundamental that you would change about the Bitcoin protocol if you could
 I think the truth is that there are always areas where you can nipc and and point out to areas where it could be different however I think it's important to realize that what we have today is something that has been able to scale to 10 billion dollars that's never happened in the history of humanity before I will we have today is something the state scales globally and is extremely secureworld Boston Brazilian that's never happened before so what side of the different version work slightly differently and produce the same results who knows I am the reason Bitcoin is where it is today was a Confluence of historic circumstance technology just the right level of maturity adoption political conditions Etc to all coming together just the right time to allow this thing to launch grow sustain itself and survive in a very turbulent environment during a time where were facing up
 accidents in the monetary crisis in influencing Raven props infecting thousands of traditional currencies that doesn't happen in a vacuum and it doesn't this kind of technological utopianism the idea that there is a best solution or the best solution wins is is naive I think in the end what when's is the solution that was good enough at the right time in history to be probably adopted we saw that in a TCP IP wasn't the best trance transport protocol or the best Internet Protocol and and yet not only did it some gain a foothold and become enormous but it's gotten to the point where it's almost impossible to introduce the new version of Ip or you transport control protocols because it's so deeply embedded in the fabric of society and then the machine so we run around us so I think the idea that pic one can be improved yes it can be improved based on what we have
 and net picking from my arm chair is is not something that is really productive daily was about JavaScript and Java Script is essentially the story of one of these minimum viable technologies that was just good enough and then just completely took off and now JavaScript is becoming the lingua Franca of the internet and it was written in three days is a long was it was originally written in 3 days and all these abstractions have been built on top of it and below it just because it was the product that was good enough and that's that's that seems to be a recurring theme park them I think one of the more interesting parts of the JavaScript phenomenon have being the fact that XML that was built over more than a decade with committees and extreme commitments and enormous amounts of money by so many organization got displaced in less than 5 years by Jason kind of a much more loose light weights for life you're my
 the original Vision free mail was x400 which preceded SMTP and turns out simple mail transport worked simple directory services are lightweight directory Services ldap 1 over x 500 and in the end Jason 1 / XML sometimes the simple technology is far more effective at beating the committee designed one I think it's the same story it's it's it's not massively over-engineered protocol it does some very basic things does them well and can scale globally
 there seems to be a good number a good number of people who have a fair amount of faith in Bitcoin admitted Bitcoin makes sense as if nothing else like a speculative that so why and you know you can have conversations with you all the time but many of them just do not own any Bitcoin so what is keeping this type of person from just buy $50 in Bitcoin just as a speculative play
 it's it's so very difficult to buy Bitcoin I mean that's the simple answer it's very difficult to buy Bitcoin and furthermore I think if you're coming at it from the position of a speculative play you're missing the most important characteristics of Bitcoin Bitcoin is in my mind's at least for my level Investments a terrible speculative Investments it's way too volatile it's it's small enough in terms of liquidity that it gets pushed around by media announcements like crazy and bounces up and down in price it's it's it's not a very good speculative investment unless you're willing to hold it for her for a long-term based on your understanding of the wrong utility of the underlying technology and capabilities and what I could do to the world and in which case is not a speculative investment in which case you're really looking at a much longer time frame and you're looking at it from the perspective of an industry changing disruptive technology in the end those really
 don't ever play out in a linear fashion and they don't you know the internet had to crash completely in 2000 to clear out a lot of the over-investment before you started seeing some of the best applications come out and I think we still got 3 or 4 more boom and bust Cycles in Bitcoin at least before you see it stabilizing why are people not buying Bitcoin because it's still very difficult to buy back when the reason it's difficult to buy Bitcoin is because we're still building the infrastructure so it's just like trying to get DSL in 1993 you would find very few and end or you'd have to buy a modem and God help you tried to set that piece of equipment top I know many did right since it was very difficult to get on the internet in the beginning and and you have to be extra committed and really believe in this idea to do so and it got easier and easier and easier I think the other thing is I often tell people don't buy Bitcoin earn it earn it the most important thing you can
 foreign exchange for Bitcoin is Goods products and services use your labor use your creativity and earn Bitcoin by charging other people in Bitcoin for work you do that bypasses a lot of the complexities of exchanges in the banking system
 do you think distributed systems is more about technology or more about philosophy
 well you've heard my previous work in this space so you'll probably guess that I think it's about philosophy I think fundamentally what it is is it represents a societal change that is being caused by the ability to scale and is changing the way we organize so the way I described it is a three-step progression whereby of thority trust and many other fundamental societal institutions were first built on institution hierarchal organizations in most cases in the early days very steep hierarchies with single people on top King's tyrants dictators despots preseason poll MN Degrassi overtime slightly smoother and flat or hierarchies but still hierarchical organizations of people with policies and procedures and oversights and rules in order
 well I was organizing Society What Women in Transition with the internet when we started organizing around Platforms in the internet being one of the most important platforms and those are for centralized and they allow us to ruin Vision societal institutions as platform base Solutions and now we're making the final shifter it's happening more and more rapidly moving from platforms to protocols and protocols Bass the power not in a specific operator like Twitter or Facebook or Google but instead they gave us the power in a common understanding a lingua Franca a common system of operation that everybody agrees to bitcoin with its consensus mechanism and its underlying protocol is a tremendous too cool for the decentralization of Power Authority trust knowledge and truth and it's really from a bigger perspective decentralisation is the final step and societies
 Millennial long efforts to more equally distribute power justice peace prosperity among more and more people around the world and so institutions to platforms to protocol so absolutely it is a philosophical thing
 to the first video I saw of you was this 2015 talk you gave at wired money and you were very enthusiastic and you also seemed
 he also seems like you had I don't want to say like a temper cuz I don't that sound like a negative connotation extremely if you believe X you're missing the point and that's that's characteristic of all these things that people focus on bitcoin where they're essentially missing the point but more importantly and in terms of your personal feelings on this matter how much of a time do you feel like a heretic
 well I don't like the word heretic because we all know what happens to them I prefer I prefer thinking of myself as someone who is willing to speak truth and conversation where somebody asked you I like you know are you a drug dealer right because you're involved in Bitcoin and it's like this absurd which hunting stuff and I didn't mean
 well I mean I I I think they're what you were saying which is really interesting is all of the examples you Hughes were people who spoke up against the established a sority of the day which was the church and died for the point is that to put it to use a famous quote in a time of universal deceit speaking the truth is an active Revolution speaking the truth is only radical because lines are the currency of the day lies are how we Comfort ourselves during the time of extreme prices and you got on the stand the contacts I mean I've done many talk some talks are optimistic some talks a happy some talk some talking to my community-acquired money I was talking to a room full of bankers and investors who are very very excited about taking the least revolutionary part of Bitcoin labeling it the blockchain whitewashing the whole thing controlling its centralizing it and turning
 listen to that little patch placing and I was there to remind them the Bitcoins going to chew their their foots off if they turn it into a pet play thing because this is not a technology that is willing to or are able to be leashed controls manipulated co-opted centralized and censored it just acknowledging that it disruptive precisely because it doesn't do those things and it's about to disrupt one of the most powerful corrupt inefficient of organizations and Industries on the planet and sources of power on the planet which is international finance and it's about Bloody time and answer from that perspective what you saw in that particular presentation was me reacting to all of this mealy-mouthed pretends disruption where was like they were using the word revolutionize which I allow for the word revolutionize has little to do with something that's revolutionary as possible
 Ed edit is the way corporations and committees revolutionize things which is basically to strip them of anything revolutionary they're talking about we want to disrupt our business from the inside out and then when you explain some wallpaper you can do they immediately recoil and they're like well I was a bit making fun of that I was but it was also listen I was paid to do a job there and my job was to bring knowledge and and so in that context the best thing I can do is Shake people off like wake them up listen you're in the street just hit an iceberg you can start bailing you can start engineering you can do some but don't pretend this isn't happening because the industries that did pretend this wasn't happening ended up disappearing banking is facing the most significant challenge in the last
 several centuries and it's facing exogenous challenges to from the crisis that it manufactured within itself but Bitcoins they are just the tip it over the edge the dinosaur is the one slow to adapt so slow to increase efficiency the ones who don't care about customer satisfaction the ones who put Prophet about about everything including the dark their customers well-being or even Liberty and and life those companies are about to get a nasty surprise and I was there to bring back message sometimes you probably watch one of my more intense and that's a radical videos it was deliberately that for that specific audience but you'll see a whole range of emotions I'm actually quite often missed it, happy-go-lucky guy and you know what really excites me about this faces is not destroying the world banking system
 it's it's seeing the lights in the eyes of young people who see opportunity in are excited by Innovation and technology and can see within the SEC Knology and others like it the possibility of world it's different a world that's more Equitable more transparent more fair and and you know for a generation that hides its entire life stolen from it I think it's it's just really satisfying to see that acts like a JP Morgan or Bank of America the type of people that you're talking to in this situation for what was their response into if you are one of these companies what do you do do you invest in Bitcoin do you try to figure out some way to leverage it
 well the truth is that in many cases there's absolutely nothing you can do and the reason there's absolutely nothing you can do is because your business model itself and your entire stream of wrapping you is solidly very solidly in and strongly built around certain principles certain inviolable principles from your business models perspective the Bitcoin just went and violated so you know if your Blockbuster and Netflix comes along you can't just start renting videos and building online service because your entire business model depends upon the acquisition and exploitation of real estate and the one thing that just changed as you don't need any real estate you can't fix that you can't survive that you are around Welling animal in the face but tsunami if you are a fish in a lake that's empty because of drought you're not going to suddenly converter gills to oxygen breathing in Oak single Jenner
 so the truth is that a lot of these Banks especially the ones that are not consumer-facing whose primary mode of operation and over the last decade more strongly so has become receiving free money from the fed and Miss allocating it's an enormous proportion and then paying themselves great bonuses for succeeding in a rigged Market I mean it's dead it's dead because it died it committed suicide in 2008 Bitcoin isn't the reason but at the same time Bitcoin shows an alternative path in the future so you know a lot of these banks are not going to survive that's the simple truth banking as we know it is not going to survive does that mean that all banks are going to wait of course not many of them will adapt they'll change their ways that went down to a much less profitable much less World controlling environment where the level of rampant financialization corruption and
 immunity to prosecution is no longer something they can count off and I woke up fat

Transcription: Human Torch majumder leads product management at shape security which defend applications from malware and Bot he's the former click frauds are at Google and he will be speaking at the upcoming coupons San Francisco human welcome to software engineering daily
 thanks for having me Jeff into our discussion of security and fraud with a discussion of bots
 a black man that is a group of machines that are acting in concert with one another for some purpose so typically a botnet is used in the malicious contact so these machines are acting together to be able to attack a website or to be able to achieve some fraudulent goal and in the vast majority of cases these bought mats are actually end-users own machines that have been compromised by malware and are now linked together into this zombie Network that provides Computing capacity to whatever criminal want to be able to use them development
 well certainly before the internet it wasn't really feasible to be able to create networks of computers quite the same way but since the early days of the internet we've seen different forms a network computer activity and botnets have been around for more than a couple of decades now cloud services like AWS or Google or Azure art disease make it easier for people to speed up a really large botanist
 they do so like I was mentioning before you often see end-users machines being compromised and then put together and bought them but one of the things that you also see is machines on AWS another cloud services being used in similar type that offer now it's easier to be able to identify one of the things that you typically don't expect is that criminals are going to be putting together a lot of capacity there so there a lot of companies out there that are still affected the same way when they see interactions from the sources use cases of botnets
 Jurassic parks are most commonly exemplified in the form of Click box and in copart's what you see is that because there was such a great incentive to click on ads I bought would be used to try and stimulates the activities of regular users and fraudulently generate a click and now their impression boxes well that our budget we generating Impressions just buy reloading different pages on which adds up here and we loading the add themselves is what you're seeing is fake Twitter accounts being created and then being resold in the form of either fake tweets or fake likes that are available for a much cheaper amount of money than it would cost for you to be able to get that thing type of activity organically and are many other types of box as well so whenever there is any
 great financial incentive that's available on an application or a website then there's some type of potential for automation to be able to exploit that a larger scale than a criminal would be able to achieve manually and that's when they create a bot
 more about the advertising botnets how big are they and how much
 revenue or bandwidth are they stealing from legitimate practices
 the bandulus isn't so much the issues I think as how much money are they able to make based off of their interactions with advertising Services I think that when you're talking about large advertising services like Google they have a very strong direct incentive to try and protect their advertising Network games click fraud and of course this is the area that I worked on for a number of years and we invested a great deal of time and resources and making sure that put productivity and in fact any type of fraudulent activity was dealt with and mitigated and prevented as much as possible but when you look at other advertising networks one of the things that you see is that it's a lot be able to achieve that same type of scale not only from the point of view of the advertising Network in terms of their investment in Click fraud detection mitigation
 also from the point of view of criminal that's trying to get a lot of dollars out of that so you don't see as much activity in a lot of areas in terms of those advertising networks however they are often Foster to concentrate their efforts more and more on those areas over the years
 record user Behavior legitimate user behavior and then replay that user Behavior or makes light permutations of that user behavior on the Auditors and are on Google's and whoever's trying to detect if a user is a bot or human how do you differentiate between a sophisticated by replaying human information versus a legitimate human actor
 what's a good question and it actually highlights one of the key things that is different about click frog than other forms of security and that is that you actually don't have to determine what the intent of a given click is inside what you're looking at is whether or not that click is likely likely to convert and result in value for an Advertiser and as a result of that it's perfectly acceptable to take a legitimate quick and Market as invalid and not require an Advertiser to pay for it so in fact there were many false positive throughout the click fraud detection system I Googling that was by Design because if you take a legitimate click and Market as invalid and don't charge the advertiser than that and that's actually a good thing from the long-term view of the ecosystem because if you're getting it a sale on Plex if you're paying less for the total number of clicks that you're receiving them
 you actually got a better Roi as an Advertiser
 so Google tended to err on the side of false positives in terms of flagging things as Bots because they were so conscious of the throne systemic fallibility
 that's right so it wasn't just for the purpose of dealing with the limitation in determining what the intent of a click or a clicker was it was also in order to be able to optimize that our life in fact there were many clicks throughout the system that Google knew you were absolutely legitimate but weren't very high converting clicks as well
 interesting what languages do these Bots tend to be written in
 what berries so typical what you see is back criminals have favorite Frameworks and favorite languages that they used in order to be able to get something into a payload that's going to go on to compromise users machine you're technically looking for something that's as small as possible so you do see a lot of C & C plus plus being used however the boss in every single language that's out that whenever you're talking about Bots that are actually designed to be run by the bad guy themselves on their own machine or on a machine that is in cloud computing system that's when you're not as concerned about the size of the payload and you can have them written in any language
 software architecture and software ecosystem and culture of programmers changed over time it sounds like this kind of dark and submerged portion of the web but it also sounds like something where there is a vibrant ecosystem and some degree of communication and culture
 oh absolutely that there's so many different ways that you can obtain box and interact with the bought authors and it's really scale. Over the course of the last five to ten years so it used to be a lot more underground and you have to communicate YRC however now what you're saying is that there are of course forms where I don't have to even be a trusted member in order to be able to start interacting with different bottle through and you can download the source code for different box as well as the boss themselves an executable form directly off of many different websites related to the you've got boss that are engaging in highly illegal activity stealing money directly out of people's bank accounts like man-in-the-browser a box but you've also got more
 grey market swords with Bots that are engaged in activities that isn't necessarily considered to be illegal however it's problematic for the websites of the users that are affected by Richard man-in-the-browser attack could you describe that attack more specifically
 sure so a man in the browser attack is the name given to an attack that actually takes over the browser interactions of an end users computer and what they typically do is they either steal credentials as the user types the mean to their browser or action modify the transactions at the user submits since their browser typically on their banking website in real time does the user logs in Fairbanks website and then the browser malware just sits there silently and waits until the user execute the transaction and then modify in transferring money for example from the user's account to another one of these was attached to count it transfers money out of the user's account into a money mule account controlled by the man in the browser I bought master and then use that money mule accounts to be able to transfer the money to the boss Master directly
 you recently moved from Google to a new company called shape security could you describe the origin story of shape security and what motivated your career shift
 sharp so Shake was co-founded by one of my colleagues from Google Simon Agarwal and he had worked at the Pentagon after he left Google and there I kidnapped Derek Smith who is one of the other co-founders and their CEO and Derek and Justin call had previously worked together and Justin had this great idea for a new way to be able to secure web application the game automated interactions and that was to be able to change the fundamental premise upon which web application function the web has this Legacy architecture where it was designed from the very beginning to be open and accessible in to be able to share information and so because of this the source code if they're seated with every web UI in the world in HTML CSS and JavaScript form is available to any attacker as well as any user because
 need to be able to access that source code in order to be able to render it in a browser but it's available to any automated interaction and because of that it's trivially easy to be able to create Web Box that interact with websites in the automated ways and this is one of the reasons that we seen so many boss over the course of the last decade So Justin's idea was to be able to take that fundamental architecture and shifted so that the quote on quote source code associated with website was no longer static and unchanging but it said was constantly writing itself because an end-user didn't actually care about what the underlying HTML CSS and JavaScript look like what they care about is whether or not they're able to interact with the graphical user interface of that site in a way that makes sense of them
 preserved how that gooey looks while constantly rewriting the underlying code because of course there an infinite number of ways to be able to write the computer code for an application then you create something which is invisible to users but is actually very difficult or impossible for money box to be able to deal with
 because at least she ate the website constantly so one description of our technology is that it creates polymorphic code and using polymorphism were able to create an inherent defense for web applications so what I mean by that is that you're not actually trying to necessarily detect malicious so much as by introducing this concept of polymorphic code the web application itself becomes resistant to interactions from box that are designed for a static version of that website so polymorphism in Greek actually means many shades
 so when you have a polymorphic variety of website versions how do you ensure that they have the same types of performance and how do you generate these polymorphic website versions
 so enjoyed the performance that's one of the key considerations that we had as we were developing the technology and you know there are various levels of optimizations involve there but the net result is that we typically add less than 20 milliseconds of latency to every page request and being able to generate the polymorphic code that something that is done in a number of different ways so we have some simple examples of being able to take things like the underlying variable names essentially in the code and being able to rename those but they're complex examples as well as a piece of what content in such a way that it does the exact same thing as it did before but it doesn't with a completely different path in terms of the code
 what products do you offer is called the shapeshifter bought wall what is a bot wall
 robot Wall-E is the name that a number of different folks of use historically for essentially something as simple as a firewall from a deployment standpoint that would allow you to deal with all of the different types of bought activity that are engaged on your website or on any type of application and so one of our core focuses as we were in stealth mode and trying to develop the product was to be able to generate the first working bought wall something that would be simple to the point but then sophisticated in its defense in terms of being able to deal with all the different types of levels and methods of Bot interaction that were out there so what we provide is called the shake the bottle service and it's this but well functionality provided in a managed Service Such that
 our customers don't have to worry about the body activity at all they get a number of different reports and analytics and there's only that they can get information about the body activity through but they don't even sell some have to worry about protecting themselves actively games bought the way that they currently do which is typically using ip-based analysis and engaging in whack a mole and trying to Blacklist a different IP addresses on a regular basis
 yeah it. The guy can look at that so it takes the web content that's associated with web application and it's constantly changes that in order to be able to create the defense point of a bot how is the bot being confounded by this polymorphic code
 tell if you have allergies give you one simple example if you got a box which is designed to take usernames and passwords that they've stolen from other websites and cast them automatically against the Target website login form then it might be created in such a way that it looks at the underlying web content that generates that login form and sees that the username field is called login and the password field is called password and then it takes the stolen usernames and passwords and stuff send me into the login field and the password field and by doing that it can create what's called credential stuffing attack and it can log into the website the X in such a way that looks like completely legitimate user activity so typically
 if you got the same IP address that's logging in millions of times or if you got the same username upon which someone is attempting many different password combination each of those patterns is easily detected and walked out so in the case of an IP address that's sending too many login request to have so many different page request of any type or login request specifically in a certain period of time and after that you got locked out in that I T can't make any more requests or the case of if you got three attempts on a username that are unsuccessful within 24 hour. Then the website might lock you out and then you have to wait a day before you can log in again but this type of activity the credentials that I was mentioning takes on a different form we're using a botnet and using lists of leak credentialed they're actually using
 single IP address to be able to log into a single account and then they use a different IP address to be able to log into a different account and they only need to try each account once because they actually have valid credentials so the way that are such a boss can actually be interrupted or blocked by polymorphism is if that bought is looking for those fields that are named login and password then all the sudden those fields are no longer named those things that their name something else and their names something different on every single page request now that type of watt can't even function anymore and so then the bar have to evolve into something else and there are a huge number of users of boss like that many criminals that are either purchasing boss like that or are renting back capacity that don't have the capability to be able to change those box themselves now for the criminals that do we have other answers
 terms of what happens when the boss of all because of course there's a cat and mouse game associated with the different ways that you can create a framework that automatically interact with the website but because of the fact that the the previous category emboss account for the results in the majority of listeners who want to know more about credential stuffing can look at the show notes I will be attaching a video that shape security did on credential stuffing this really interesting and clarifies things so I'm curious about how a potential customer would integrate with with shapes security with a shape-shifter bought wall or a different service that you offer how do you integrate your service into existing Enterprises
 so there are a couple of different ways that you can implemented the most straightforward way is that some of the largest companies in the world and they have their own infrastructures they control their own what servers and their own load balancers and we attach the physical Appliance directly to the load balancer so that's load balancer rules determine which URLs are going to be protected then those get transformed in both directions it's simple first foxy in that sense
 and why do you integrate the load balancer level more detail
 sure just to be able to provide the customer with direct control over what gets transformed as well as to be able to inherit their own high-availability infrastructure
 okay does somebody need to be monitoring for operating the shapeshifter bought while like does the company need a devops engineer to operate a gooey or anything
 is it on the reasons that we provided as a service there isn't a direct requirement on the part of the company to constantly look at alerts and monitor output coming from the service. Of course is all available and security operations team or a network operations team or fraud team that is interested in being able to get more insight into what's going on on there what application and be able to zero in on different attacks that are being deflected has the analytics to be able to do that within the product but mitigate whatever automated packs are being directed inside application
 I'd like to zoom out and talk about security from a broader perspective we did a week of shows on security and what are the motifs was the trade-offs between security and privacy what do you think is the relationship between security and privacy
 well I think that whenever you got things like data breaches that are occurring that's the most direct intersection between the two so in terms of what customers are experiencing these days that is so that there are other intersections as well for example from a national security perspective where people are concerned about how much data does the government need to be able to collect in order to be able to protect the country and protect its citizens but I think that for me direct interaction standpoint when people have to worry about whether or not their identity is being stolen as the result of a corporate data breach that's when the issue of privacy and security are directly associated with one another in the bathroom drawer you cases these days
 how much of the investment are different companies making inadequate Security in order to protect the privacy of their users and that's not only from the point of view of protecting data that they have accumulated about their users and preventing that from being breached but also from the point of view of holiday designing their systems from the data collection standpoint and whether or not that data collection itself is secure and whether or not they're collecting more data than they need to so all of these are pretty complex issues that really require folks that have a great deal of experience and does privacy and security to help shape the policies of different areas not only from human resource department but also from technology
 shopping and buying more infrastructure to be able to protect their users from both a security and privacy stand plan
 data breaches the most recent large headline data breach is the Ashley Madison Case and for those who don't know the Ashley Madison is this cheating site where married individuals could find each other and hook up and it was hacked so all these users that were intending to cheat on their spouses got exposed it was this giant news story so drunk security week I ask people about this in the opinions kind of range many people said it was this story that is not really important this other than the fact that it to this salacious site it was important because it was the security Community to say hey look if if if you're not careful this could be you and if you use a service that is not careful with the security this could be you so have you seen any
 aberrations through the security Community as a result of this actually Madison stuff
 I wouldn't say they're going to many reverberation throughout the security Community pay attention to the story and I think that the reverberations are more throughout General Society than they are throughout the security Community types of breaches have become commonplace for several years now and in fact that particular site is not smaller than some of the mechanisms that will used are pretty much the same as what we see in other types of breaches but the fact that it's drawing a lot more attention to something that's beneficial from the standpoint of people now asking questions about what could happen then you know what do companies that have even more important types of data for pregnant
 they need to be doing from the point of you being able to protect their users and of course organizations like financial institutions have recognized these threats for many many years and I've invested proactively to be able to protect themselves but I think that increasing public scrutiny lend itself to companies being even more cautious and wanting to invest more and make sure that there aren't any gaps but they were overlooked in their security infrastructures
 we also did an interview with Bruce schneier about internet of things attacks like you could have a bunch of refrigerators with computers processors going to launch a denial-of-service attack against for dental financial institutions Bank of America kind of sounds like a bot attack ship security thinks about possible is this type of concerted internet-of-things attack
 it's very possible so I think that the fridgerators are very good example because you're seeing internet functionality put into refrigerators as well as other household appliances in ways that a lot of folks are questioning now they're wondering is it really necessary for this Appliance have internet connected functionality and the fact that it may be running a Linux operating system for example or something not capable of being able to send web request that allows it to function the same way that any compromise machine manufacturers of household appliances are not Security Experts in fact they're not even
 previously didn't have any kind of network connectivity so it's that lends itself to having more security holes in those types of appliances and having thousands of different categories of internet-connected appliances that are now easier for a bad guy to be able to compromise than regular PCS and tablets are then that's of course we're there and that's where we will be going to see the next generation of bought that mountain. Type of expertise in the development of these types of appliances and detect the features and the problem there is that I think that a lot of this functionality is being created just for marketing purposes as opposed to any type of real benefit to the purchasers of these appliances so as a result
 that there isn't as much care that's being taken in the construction of the network functionality and I think that it's going to take a while and probably some incidents before people are going to start wondering if you know whether or not that we really need to have that type of Internet connected functionality in something like a refrigerator or toaster I think that one of the other question is raised here is how do people think about the best way to be able to protect themselves over all because if your own refrigerator is compromised and is used in the bottom that they stack that hasn't actually hurt you necessarily it's hurt whoever was the victim of that attack love the target bought master was the incentives aren't necessarily clear and not wanting to have that internet connected
 you don't want that internet-connected functionality in someone else's refrigerator or in the refrigerator that you don't care as much and will probably take got some time and education for the industry the result but it did mean time I think the concern is what can you do as an application owner to be able to protect yourself and to protect your users
 charge of these types of botnets that you see for example the advertising botnets is it a particular nationality or type who who who is it from the nationalities it's distributed all over the world so you see a great deal of activity from the United States you also see it from just about every other country in the world now there are concentrations in terms of different parts of the world that have more basically computer science, that's what it comes down to in terms of wherever you see folks that have the capability to be able to create sophisticated software you see it being used for good as well as for bad and in terms of the the targets of these attacks you similarly Steve them distributed all over the world I spoken with companies in every part of the world
 they're the victims of the same types of attacks
 interesting
 I'd love to
 Insight about what you saw when you were working on ads at Google how much advertising fraud is there on the internet
 so there is a fraud scheme associated with just about every single major web service and the extent to which that is engaged in by criminal organizations and buy individual Foster's is directly proportional to the amount of money that they can get out of the system so one of the key incentives in advertising fraud was being able to get a check from the advertising Network or from the advertisers themselves by of the advertising Network and when you have that type of incentive you see a great deal of sophistication and effort that is put into creating the tool associated with that attack and so we would see many different types of tools that are created from simple click box to actual botnets to management Frameworks that would enable people to recruit others
 would sit in cyber cafes and click on ads all day in some kind of organized format now the expensive that is also directly related to the size of the advertising Network so in the case of Google we would see thousands of attackers from all over the world on a daily basis and that was one of the reasons that Google I would actually Mark in the millions of clicks as invalid on a daily basis
 what about on sites like Facebook and Instagram maybe you're not as familiar with how much fraud these types of companies do with it is there any added layer of Security based on the the clothes identity contract that that Facebook has
 there is it's a complicated relationship with dealing with fake accounts and the fake like when you're talking about social network because of the fact that the social networks are trying to enable automated interactions themselves in some ways so for example when you look at Twitter and things that you see is that they are essentially replacing what RSS feeds used to do a number of years ago and they're allowing news organizations to be able to use box to be able to read out new headline but when you're talking about fake account that's when you really talking about fraud and users are concerned when they see large numbers of fake accounts and fake likes that are existing on on Twitter and Facebook so that's where they have similar types of control setup in a different
 because of the fact that the interactions of his box go beyond a single click for example so in the case of a fake Facebook user everything about the bot master needs to do is not only create the account and use it to be able to like different content that they want to be able to promote War to be able to create a kit interactions about a variety but they also needs to be able to maintain. Profiles interactions in such a way that they allude Facebook's detection system so for example of Facebook worth a million fake accounts like the exact same text or they all sent out the exact same message that would be very easy to flag and deal with so instead what The Fosters are trying to do is make each of those accounts look
 their unique and that requires a lot more sophistication in terms of what we call a Persona management software
 with any sort of security problem where the people that are trying to evade the Security Experts are they'll find some exploit in the security expert eventually like also discovered that exploit but there seems to be this this time window where scammers or people who are evading the Security Experts do get to exploit security hole some some hole in the Google advertising system and make tons of money for a long period of time and then Google discovers it how does Google the backlog of potentially fraudulent Behavior or are there certain areas where Google does discovers this this exploit and then it has to say oh my God there's no way that we can go back in time and replay all these transactions or how does that play out
 so in such a scenario and you know that's pretty rare that the glue wood to discover a number of different interactions or transactions that completely I made it through and I will miss by their detection systems they can simply go back and refund the money to The Advertiser and retroactively Mark those click says invalid so if you don't have to actually run them through the system
 okay so I start right over dramatizing in terms of money stolen from someone's account and that has Ripple effects in terms of affecting that person's credit if check bounces and you know you got somebody can be affected by identity theft of course it's really difficult to be able to fully restore. User advertising fraud changed while you are at Google you are an early product manager on AdSense the ways that people were exploiting the system and how did that change over time or become more sophisticated
 I think that in the early days you would see more individual Clippers and pretty unsophisticated types of schemes and they just got more sophisticated over time so we would see more button and paste activity more automation framework that were being used and this is the type of evolution that you typically see in any industry so when people realize that you got business which is growing and there's the capability for someone who was able to successfully defrauda to be able to extract money from that system then they put a lot more energy into trying to come up with sophisticated ways to get around the defenses that they think are there but of course that was one of the reasons that we continue to invest in our security infrastructure and you know try to stay ahead of whatever the bad guys were doing
 you're going to be giving a talk at Q Con San Francisco content of that talk
 show me the talking about the imitation game and in that phrase I don't mean the movie although of course the movie has helped popularized the term with the general public but I mean the original name that Alan Turing gave to the Turing test so how the imitation game or the cheering test has now become essentially the primary area Focus for criminals as well as for Defenders on web applications and website so you can do a lot from a security perspective to be able to secure your infrastructure and you can close every hole that might exist from the point of view of portions of your infrastructure that are not available to be directly interacted with by your users but whatever you're talking about a user interface a different type of area where you always want
 same team as much accessibility and keep that as friction-free it possible for your legitimate users to be able to use your application and that actually represents an opportunity for attackers to be able to hide within that legitimate traffic and interact with your site the exact same way that is a legitimate user guide and so if they can pass the Turing test or win the imitation game then they're going to be able to beat your security system on the user interface layer and they're going to be able to perpetrate fraud on your system so the question is how do you protect that user interface layer in 2015 without harming your user experience
 I find it so dystopian because one of the things that was going on I don't know how much you've looked into this case but there were there were engineers at Ashley Madison to we're actually creating bots accounts that would communicate with male customers so mail so mail users would log on to the site and like begin looking for somebody to hook up with and they would end up messaging of bought and the bot would respond to hey. How's it going like let's have a conversation seems like very dystopian when I have these services that are actually generating Bots and these boxes are passing the Turing test in order to create customers
 I mean have you ever heard of this and what does it make you think of is this in or is this as dystopian to you as it is to me
 well I think that the types of box that will describe were actually pretty simplistic when it comes to their design and the types of messages that they would send so any sophisticated analyst would look at those types of content than they would be able to flag it as a bought right away but much more sophisticated types of boss that are able to do more complex forms of actions on other websites that actually have a great deal of defense that has been put in place and one of the things that makes me not think of it as of right now is the fact that they're full all the tools are still from in the category of what we call weak AI tools so it's not like the software is capable of
 reasoning the way that human being does it's not problem solving in any type of meaningful fashion and said that they're simply performing repetitive action the way that they're human authors of program them too so I think that it's all a question of staying ahead and that cat and mouse game and being able to flag the tools as they're coming in and advertising and public health and security and we didn't get into some of these topics of Interest what were the invisible threads that connected these disparate topics within technology and how did they strengthen your expertise
 well I think without a doubt The Invisible Thread is the rise and ubiqd of the internet so it's hard to imagine the time I think for most folks in the technology now when there wasn't a commercial internet in the commercial web that everybody in the world that was using computers was essentially connected to but it has enabled forms of content sharing and interaction in Commerce that I think will very difficult to conceive of an understanding the weather going to look like when they're rapping incipient stage and even now I think we're still struggling to understand what all of this content and all of these business models are going to look like 10 to 20 years from now so we're still seeing innovation in terms of new business models and new types of
 tonality and trying to understand what the long-term effects are so data breaches are one example of this we all created hundreds of accounts on so many different systems given so many different websites are data and user information and we're only now starting to understand what the ramifications of that and similarly when looking at the music industry we're still seeing innovation in terms of the business models or seeing Apple coming out with their first streaming service just this year and I think that's it still remains to be seen exactly what the dominant business model for music distribution is going to be in the next 5 to 10 years
 Sherwin gosh majumder thank you for coming onto software engineering daily thanks very much Jeff I really enjoyed it to Jenna

Transcription: a huge percentage of online advertisements are never seen by humans their viewed by Bots automated scripts that are opening web pages in a browser and pretending to be a human advertising scammers set up web pages in bed automated advertising on those web pages and then pay for bought traffic to come and view those advertisements this aspect of the internet is bizarre and alarming think about it how much of the internet economy depends on online advertising a lot how many of those advertisements are consumed by robots some estimates say as much as 80% the more time I spend looking at the online advertising industry the more perplexed and curious I become Augustine Foo also has this curiosity he got a PhD at MIT in Material Science and Engineering but today he spends his time researching advertising fraud and working as an independent consultant
so stay tuned to find out his background and also what he thinks about advertising fraud a quick note if you are in the Bay Area on January 11th come to the software engineering daily me up at Galvanize San Francisco there will be some awesome speakers they'll be food is a positive atmosphere and you can find much more information about this on software engineering daily.com or its software engineering daily meet up page I hope you come check it out

 Augustine Foo is an independent add fraud researcher Augustine welcome to software engineering daily thank you Jeff year did 5 or 6 interviews about advertising fraud at this point but I'd like to start with some fundamentals in case listeners are turning into this topic for the first time what is advertising fraud so add fraud in the digital side of things is very simple it's just ads that are shown to users that are not humans so normally advertisers would assume that when they put their ads online that humans are seeing them and normally that would be the right assumption because if a human is visiting a website like Yahoo or ESPN of Wall Street Journal then when they load the page the ad load so then now the human seeing it but unfortunately with the rise of programmatic Technologies and at that works there's now a
 fake sites that has no human visitors and all the traffic comes from bots so then when he added pressure in Lowe's on those sites it's not a human that saying that it's actually a lot so that's what I thought is one thing I want to stress in this interview is that making money as an ad fraudster is very easy what are some of the steps that I could take if I wanted to start making money today as an address or not this is not an endorsement of advertising fraud or like a how to guide but just in case people are thinking like oh this is so complicated thing that only black hats are capable of explain how easy it is that is a very good point it's easier than people think it is it is right now so there's two key ingredients to digital ad fraud and those are fake websites and fake users so first anyone how you can just go register a website you know for $7 or whatever
 so you can easily set up web sites and then you would load them into at exchanges so what that means is that you would basically register with an ad exchange so that you can carry ads right so they will give you a bit of code that you put on the page so that you can run their ads and then you need fake users which you can now go by by the thousands right so there's a lot of people online that sell you know traffic so you just go by that traffic on a CPM basis which means cost per thousand basis and then you use that traffic to hit your web pages and then when they eat when a web page loads the ad loads so basically it's very simple to register a web sites for simple to you know add yourself to an ad exchange especially the H group was one she really don't check right and then it's very easy to go by traffic and Economics work out really beautifully and simply because if you buy traffic for $1 CPM
 special every thousand hits to your website cost you $1 and you know you can sell your ads for $10 has TPMS then you basically pocketed $9 of your profit so not only is it easy to create but it's also extremely profitable and lucrative that sounds very high margin it sounds very scalable Johnsbury replicable once I get one site up and running it sounds like I can just keep repeating this process ad infinitum so this sounds like a really pernicious problem do you have any idea how widespread it is yes it's way more widespread than anyone thinks it's possible and that's because over the years there's more more mechanisms that are in place to help the scale up so without getting into too much details you know there's
 did many different estimates of fraud but let me paste it on the estimates of traffic is so there's many studies several other companies in three specifically that I cited in my recent research that say that two-thirds of the traffic on the internet are not human so we'll start with that right so if the traffic now this isn't necessarily fraudulent traffic it's just that it's not human right so when Google sends a crawler out to index a site so that those the side in the contents can show up in search results that's still not a human right so it's a good thought but nonetheless it's you know I'm not supposed to cause a depressions right so it's still not a human it's about a good thought but it's not human so if two-thirds of the traffic on the internet is not humid then at least two-thirds of the page views the oppressions all that kind of stuff is not seen by a human or human did
 cause those web pages are added pressure so low but I do believe that's the amount of activity that the Box account for is far more or far greater than what a human would normally generate online so human might look at one or two pages right they might go to that article that they're interested in read it and then leave but I buy could be programmed to repeatedly hit that site or a sequence of 10 different pages to make it look more legitimate right shelf or bottom it's really really easy to generate many patriots records vote doesn't care they've done their job when they loaded a webpage of coffee a depression to look people might say okay there's fraudulent advertising there's Bots but this stuff is Christ into the cost of online advertising is that true that would have been true many years ago and you know if there were only a small purse
 major fraud but that argument starts to break down when 90% of the traffic you're buying is fraud or if you say okay I used to pay $50 cpm's and then went down to $40 CPMC I went down to $30 cpm's but now it's $3 she PM's and maybe next year is going to be $0.30 cpm's if the entire number of impressions of that $0.30 is generated by box even the $0.30 CPM is still not worth it for you as an Advertiser so the price didn't argument has been a convenient excuse for the advertisers and their agencies to not have to deal with this problem but it no longer holds up when you're talking about 3 cents epm's $3 CPM the reason the bad guys can sell the a depression inventory for such a low cost is because they didn't have to generate content they didn't have to earn their audience needing get humans to the side
 he's always attacked you have to make real content that real humans want to read so this case they don't care because they know they can just buy the traffic from bought anyway so that's why they can sell it for such a low cost and that being said even the $3 she p.m. so that's $0.30 epm's are going to be all fake and so therefore it's not worth the advertiser fine so the whole you know fraud has built-in or priced and you know that's a convenient excuse that really should not be used anymore is it possible for us to implement systems that identify Bots as they're hitting the page that we don't serve the Bots traffic advertising traffic yes but there's different kinds of bots in different spots meaning some are more advanced than others so I usually categorize it into another kind of low medium and high so just to be maybe oversimplifying just a little bit the really the simplest Bots are just scripts that
 repeatedly load web pages by even those really dumb Bots often are enough to cause the web page to load and cause the ad Impressions alone I so even they can earn some address fraudulently the middle tier which is a little bit more Advance spots those are the ones that are typically created in a data center so these are made from developer tools like Phantom jet yes I said that Jess is just a tool that developers use to test their web sites or tested mobile apps before they launch them so those can be programmed it scripted to do things repeatedly like scroll up and down the page move the mouse around getting a fake mouse and click on things that's how the developers can test out their websites so these legitimate tools are now being used for illegitimate purposes but because they can kind of do all these things you know if a fraud detection mechanism assumes that Mouse movement is indicative of humor
 then they were incorrectly assumed that this bought was actually human because he saw a mouse movements right so these this middle tier of bots are being used to get around kind of simple or basic fraud detection mechanisms right so as long as they can still load the page and cause the a depression to load they've caused at front then you get to the most advanced kind of bots and those are the ones that have to come into play when the advertiser has the most sophisticated front xtian mechanisms in place right so in that case I would I typically referred of these has malware on human species because if there's malware on a PC they can actually record the real humans Mouse movements and typing on the keyboard and what they do is they play that back like the mouse movements are they play that back in order to defeat the most sophisticated fraud protection mechanism so in certain cases it's still worth it for the bad guy
 rice to use or pay more for these most advanced Bots because they know they can get by the most advanced fraud detection I want both of those last two techniques that you that you discussed the replay attack where you got a piece of malware on somebody's computer or you could also just have a farm of people in India or Pakistan that are doing somewhat legitimate internet behavior and you record what they're doing you could build machine learning models based off of what they're doing that replicate their their behavior you're right I would agree with you because you are recording real humans movements then all those biometric techniques are going to pass me to get to pass the test show the point of this is that you know when you program a mouse to go from like a fake mouse to go from point A to point B is going to just move there in a straight line and so you know
 humans normally move their Mouse on the page in kind of more smooth curves so if you see a lot of straight lines and angles than you know that's a Telltale side of body is there programmatically told to Hidalgo different place on it on the page so that being said when you have something that can record the natural Mouse movement of a real human and then play that back that specifically will defeat those fraud detection mechanisms that are looking for you know characteristic Mouse movements or Mouse movies are characteristic of humans that being said you know you talked about Farms of people in India Pakistan I mean they used to do that they used to need humans to do that but now they can install code on various web sites so if you think about piracy sites where there's pirated movies and music and also porn sites there's actually going to be a lot of humans going to those sites so those sites player
 strickler specialized roll and the fraud ecosystem where because there are a lot of humans going there they're going to have code there they just recorded their visitors actual Mouse movement patterns Ryan so now you have millions and millions of real humans generating millions and millions of human-like Mouse movement patterns that then can be randomly sampled and played back at will when necessary to defeat the fraud detection you know mechanisms and then oh by the way when you have humans coming to those sites those are the sites that are deliberately attempting various malware exploits right now that's part of their process because if if they could compromise a portion of their visitors then those PCS become candidates are at 8 they are ready to be added into a pot Network a botnet to be used for the next attack okay and this is the highly sophisticated level of
 attacks this is not even talking about the much easier to execute process of spitting up a Cloud Server and running Phantom js on cloudsurfer and just going to websites that way so you know I've been arguing with this Tahoe security researcher to ask our names by to I've had an ongoing bat with him that says I think that the Datacenter Bots which charges the Phantom JS created and data center is now going to be the the vast majority of the boss just because they are simple to create cuz you just use a script to create a million copies of the exact same bought right spot up in a data center vs. malware which means you have to wait until and unsuspecting human accidentally clicked on you know a link that they shouldn't click on and get malware on if he sees the other thing that's in play
 sat PCS and laptops now have a very mature ecosystem of anti-virus anti-malware software right that's not the case for mobile devices whatever fight in the case of PC East you know that the incidence of now where is getting lower and lower and harder and harder to actually execute so that's why I broke out those two categories right there's only certain circumstances where the bad guys really need that advanced of a bot in order to get by the security mechanisms and as an example would be an hour from Smile Dentistry vertical that's under heavy attack it's a pharmaceutical industry right because the cpc's are so high and the cpm's are so high so it's still worth it for the bad guys to buy more expensive Bots because they know they can make a lot more right for all the other cases they can use the less-expensive box there created a data center eu's those boss don't have to work that hard right they can still create the ad front well okay so you're
 dang that basically there are ways to detect the data center traffic what are those ways I'll just look up the amazon data center IP address ranges or level 3 orcollo Crossing or I can buy a Rackspace that is so technically easy to do but yet is not being done by agencies ad networks and all that because if they do that they might lock boss a very large portion of their inventory or there traffic so it then becomes into the next much harder aspect of add fraud is are these people motivate are these companies motivated to actually fight the fraud even though it's technically easy right so in the case of detecting data centers everyone should be doing that already because humans don't access the internet through data centers so when you see a visit coming from a data center or if you see thousands of visits coming from a Datacenter those are not humans so
 it should be very straightforward and technically easy to filter those out but yet it's not being done on a large scale your company runs on Apple devices developers use Apple laptops project managers use iPads and everyone uses an iPhone jamp now is a cloud-based mobile device management solution for iPads iPhones and Max in your workplace jamp now makes device management accessible and affordable for everyone so businesses can support their users without help from the IT department with champ now you can configure settings on all of your Apple devices quickly and consistently over the air and Jeff now allows you to manage your devices by centrally deploying apps anytime from anywhere you can create a free account today at jam.com

 okay just to give people who haven't heard the other shows that I've done a bigger picture of this one of the perversion of this industry is that there's not a whole lot of incentive for a lot of the different players in the advertising business to to limit the amount of fraud there's an incentive on the part of the advertiser like if you're a pharmaceutical company obviously you want fraud to be prevented but in terms of the exchange or the DSP or the SSP are all these different layers of middlemen actually all that they really want are more frequent transactions and or more Impressions that run through their system and they don't actually care that much if it's fraud or if it's not if it's Bots or if it's not they just care about processing those transactions so it creates perverse
 incentive structures I mean is is that accurate are there are there incentives for the exchanges and stuff to the police fraud more you know why isn't this why isn't it being police more it's those more business-oriented examples right so technically yes we can detect the box and yes we can filter out data centers very easily but like you said it's a business incentives in the financial motivation stress so if an ad Network prices has a revenue model that's based on the number of compressions that flow through the exchange they're not going to do anything that's going to reduce their top line revenue by 30% by 50% right so they will you catch the most obvious stuff and they will do what the industry trade bodies require them to do so for example the IP has a list of bots and oh yeah we're scraping against that list
 so they done their job but they really have no motive to do any more than that so that's really the problem that has perpetuated the fraud the other issue is that the buyers sometimes it's not an issue the advertising sells it could be the agencies that are buying for them because they are gold on how many Impressions that they buy and also at what average cost is another kind of perverse incentives there because the agency Canal show to their client we bought you more Impressions at Lowe's or average cost by buying some really low cost stuff and mixing that in right so there's an incentive built-in for them to buy really low-cost traffic I-80 low-quality I ain't no humans in order to for them to look better and bring down the average cost so until those kind of business things change and I told the advertisers in Sister agent to their agencies it's really about
 buy quality not about buying quantity and we're going to also change your reward structure your incentive structure so it's not based on how many Impressions you bought for us exactly how many versions are how much business you drove for us then all of these existing kind of motivations or incentives are going to again perpetuate fraud that's why it hasn't been solved an egret pics that there's not a direct path to becoming a specialist in add fraud and this is evident in your case as much as anyone you went to MIT you got a PhD in Material Science and Engineering I don't want to go through your entire background but could you explain how you wound up doing advertising for a setting advertising fraud full-time how you made it from Material Science to study advertising fraud and why why are you focused on this highly Niche topic
 I think I have unique background experiences and you need qualifications to be looking into it so it's really the combination of marketing analytics as well as an understanding of the technology so the technology part is simple it's really understanding how the pot makers make the Bots right cuz if we know what the pots can do then we can look for kind of The Tell-Tale signs so one example I gave it a recent class was that you know boss can be programmed to hit a page X number of times per hour right so then if you have the same number of visits to the page for every time. Then you're going to see a horizontal line in your in your charts right so when you see straight lines or rectangles in your charts something's wrong because humans don't visit in such a neat patterns so those are examples of things that I can now tell you in the analytics you know those are tell tale signs I can see any analytics because I understand how pots work
 that's a technical side the marketing side is really you know as I got back into the Consulting side of the business when I ask for details of the traffic the visitors coming to the side and what they did a very often from the attic changes they wouldn't tell me where the ads replaced I said that was the first red flag the second is they would just give you one rolled up number like oh you got an average click-through rate of this and then they won't give me any other details such as a data scientist and also just as a scientist without knowing how they got those numbers and what assumptions went into those numbers I didn't know if I could trust those numbers so ultimately I ended up building Tech so that we can do our own detection and then Dad says what led me into kind of the fraud research side of it because before I can actually do any of the digital strategy Consulting I have to make sure the date is clean and then you know because none of these vendors
 Network were you able to give me enough details for me to judge whether the date it was clean we had to go build their own tools so that we can do our own measurement so now that I have the tools I'm being called into the various clients to help them verify that the date is correct and then to build correct strategies on top of that it's a lot of times when the Bots are creating the say traffic is a compression to the fake clicks all that gets recorded in the analytics and then if you don't know what portion of your traffic is coming from the box then you don't know how wrong your analytics are so it's really about cleaning up the analytics first so that then we can do better digital strategy interview people such as yourself or shawland Argo interviewed last week about advertising fraud I can't help but think of the characters in the book The Big Short where your
 giant industry that is built around Financial activities that don't seem to be creating much value all of the signs point to perhaps a bubble or collection Behavior this just like this is this doesn't make any sense it's this crazy herd mentality of the huge industry being built up when you look at the amount of fraud in the advertising industry does it upset you does it worry you a lot more practical than that of course it does upset me and of course you know it's sad to see so many advertises get ripped off and in awhile The Advertiser we getting ripped off the good Publishers are also seeing two clients and revenue because some of the bad guys in the middle are literally taking money out of the digital add ecosystem right into their own Pockets so both sides the good appetizers and a good Publishers be hurt and so it's really bad for the entire digital ad ecosystem but feeling song
 for the whole ecosystem is really not going to do anything so you're basically what it's come down to is there are certain people there certain companies that actually want to do better are there certain advertisers who actually want to improve their media and show those the ones that call me up and say can you help right there others that are perfectly content to just keep buying the way they bought and trust that everything is taken care of by somebody else and or that Friday is already priced-in so let's not rock the boat and let's just keep doing what we're used to and I'm sitting on the publisher side and then same thing with all the middleman right so I will tell you over the years none of the middleman I won't name any even any categories none of the middleman are my clients cuz they actually don't want to hear any of this so you don't long story short is I help the people who want to be helped and these days you know I've already published enough for the research to help
 navigate to Market that when someone actually needs help they can find the stuff besides the LinkedIn post that I published and then don't call me up and then I can help them so it's really not you know not that practical or useful to be so sorry for the whole industry even though no digital hasn't really achieved its full potential because of all these problems what role do Facebook and Google play in this advertising ecosystem
 so a lot of people call them while Gardens as a Facebook in particular maybe Twitter cuz they're login environments and you know those are kind of their own closed ecosystems they do sell ads right face have display ads some text-based asking that kind of sucks but they have their own carve out and in general if I were to naked dramatic oversimplification some of those walls Gardens are less prone to this kind of fraud it comes down to basic economics right if the Bots can't make money they're not going to waste any time doing it right so if the a depression Lowe's in Facebook Facebook make some money so the Flies don't have any Financial motive to cause a whole bunch of a depression to load right there's other forms of fraud on Facebook like fake accounts fake likes on that kind of stuff but those are different than what we're talking about here right it's the fake Impressions that we're talking about so you know for sure and advertisers it would make a lot of sense for them to advertise in those clothes
 wall Gardens like a Facebook or Twitter show me Walgreens is not necessarily a bad thing right yeah and then also on Google when you advertise on the main properties like google.com when the add serves their Google make some money and the bad guys don't so get in the Box don't spend a lot of time causing a depression solo there same thing with you too I so some of those things would be very good places to put your ads because they're less prone to this kind of astronaut that we're talking about here that's pots create a lot of its when you get into the partner networks right where someone else like a third party site is allowed to carry Google ads weather to display at her search at and those third-party sites have now a financial motive to inflate their own Revenue by using visitors right are you the boss so when you have that and sent it right those are much much more prone to fraud and then it's basically like will doze Publishers are will those websites
 do the right thing and not inflate their own ad Revenue by using Bots then it comes down to kind of a moral judgment call so that usually not very reliable the walled-garden nature or of Facebook and Google seems really appealing because you can get something that is not biometric but is as appealing as a biometric measurement like you can just look at the social graphs and you can look at how somebody's how somebody is in her interfacing with other people over Gmail and you can get something that asymptotes towards being able to really look at somebody as as a human because they are interacting with other people that look like humans and the thing about bosses day 10 my understanding is they tend to look like it to tease that are just interacting with other Bots let me let me counter that a little bit to say that the Bots the fake accounts on face
 are built up to connect to a lot of humans so you know you might have seen this in your own Facebook experience but you know I'm getting a lot of just random request from random Facebook accounts and usually it's some hot girl was one picture right and nothing else posted so for the Casual Observer who's not security cyber security focuser no thank you that way oh what someone wants to friend me let's accept the friend request so then those boss in those fake accounts that are being managed by Bots are actually can you know connecting to a lot of humans so that alone is not enough right it's usually it's a good way of telling but you know don't rely on that hundred percent that the other example of what Google's doing is that they have a ton of users are logged in so they ready kind of made some ways or they had a shot across the bow to say that you know come 2017 they're going to start testing examples where your ass gets shown only in login environments rides that
 includes Gmail that include YouTube that includes other login places where you're logged into Google the other benefit of that is that when you're logged into any of the Google properties weather on your desktop computer on your mobile device they have characteristics of you meeting a human right they know you're geotrace they know what city you live in where you tend to walk and all that has Shopkins you have your mobile device with you all the time so given that they now recently announced the the new capture system or doesn't rely on a human typing in some kind of a screwed-up letters right to try to get that get by that his boss can do that easily now what they're doing is they have other information about that user and not necessarily the personal information just more like characteristics of that identifier so that they can make it a decent guess whether it's highly likely to be you or a person so that they can make it easier cap
 my system that captures I've seen recently is that you have to click a few things on a picture and then you're done right so they can even look at the mouse movement and if you click too fast that's not care because you were human if you click in the normal speed that a human could do then those are things that they can easily check and say oh yes we know this is a human so there's some benefits to kind of these closed ecosystems and it's already starting to show up in kind of new offers a new services like what I just mentioned in terms of Google's recaptcha difficult to audit is that an organ no statistics about it you would have to know both the numerator and the denominator of like a bot traffic versus non bot traffic in that assumes an ability to capture all of the traffic on the internet can you explain how a major advertising players like rocket fuel
 alright I guess we should be mentioning specific names but you mentioned that in in one of your presentation that you know is like a player that publishes statistics for how much traffic there is an I look at this and how are they finding these numbers or how can you order this this overall Internet advertising ecosystem well in this case of those three companies had different methodologies and they're just sampling what they can see right so each of them sees a portion of the internet but you know what the eyesight other people's research and went three companies different companies different methodologies they see different portions of the internet all say that 50 to 60 65% of the traffic is not human then I have three sources that have proper way to each other that's how I can cite that number right so you're right no one really has visibility across the entire internet maybe Google can come closest to that than anyone else
 still they see their particular slice of the university and then you extrapolate from there do you have an idea for how much digital ad spend ends up being wasted on fraud it's a lot but you know that I have a couple she's numbers before I'll just tell you the recent change that I made so last year I had a pie chart out there that says about a third of the dollars are lost fraud and basically siphoned out of the ecosystem I just updated that chart to half so I'm being conservative here you know seeing the two thirds of the traffic is thoughts are not human but I'm just citing a half of the the dollars are being siphoned off just to be extra conservative but again those big rolled up numbers are really not that useful because it is too many assumptions that went into those things what I usually tell clients is that they should measure at their own situation because I've seen clients with 98% box and I've seen
 it's with 2% pots and that's because of a difference in how visual at they are I saw the one with 98% Bots is the one that assumed their agency took care of it and then the agency assumed they had that we took care of it and then the ad Network assume that the SSP took care of it and so on and so forth that one else as soon as someone else took care of it and basically no one did where is the one that had 2% for Nancy Advertiser was very knowledgeable the agency that was serving them was very knowledgeable and they constantly looked at the data and they constantly improve their media and pressed the networks and all that to help them put checks and balances in place the strategies that these companies can take an Advertiser can take to get there fake traffic down to 2% what are the strategies is it selecting from basically selecting from the flow of sources of Publishers or is it
 the Publishers okay yeah so so very simply I mean sometimes it's just too no matter where you buy and stuff like that so it was the first best practice first rule of thumb is don't assume that someone else took care of it second rule of thumb is don't assume that when they say they have some fraud detection platform in place that that's going to take care of it so yes it's going to be better than not having a fraud detection technology in place but that's not going to catch all of it right in some cases it's not going to catch even close to all of it so it really is something you have to know keep checking so these companies it's it's I would call it more of a business process so it's not it's so you still add more Tech at it to detect and then Deuce do stuff for you it's going to be half attack have the right Tools in place but also be vigilant and when you look at the technology that's going to help you pick off 8 the obvious ones right so when you seen Datacenter traffic or names boss and all that kind of stuff all those
 should be scrubbed out right away and then you look at your own analytics to say you don't use this traffic converting anyway right so if we're getting a whole ton of traffic from Dish Network do any visitors ever convert into anything that I'm interested in right so for some of the categories like retail or travel it's very easy to see the conversion could you can see the purchase so you can see the travel booking right on this online but even for offline type advertisers like a cpg company that sells your package Goods in grocery stores or soda manufacturers they should still have a way to track through to conversion events ISO as an example for a cpg company you can track it all the way through to a click and print coupon which that they know at the ratio of those people who printed the coupon will actually in some portion of them will take to the store to redeem so even those things are good indicators write a bot has no answer
 I have to print off the coupon right they would have already committed a fraud by causing the a depression to load so you want to pick those things those conversion events that you can observe that are less likely to be fake by the Bots I mean either either unable to fake it or they have no Financial motive to take those and then you have parameters that are much more reliable and basically free from body activity so then if you can track it all the way through to those conversion events then you can say okay looking at all the different places that I buy media you know which are the best ones that are yielding the most business results that I should actually increase my spam to those his and I know I can drive more business results and it for the place they're not converting this could be you know simply it's the audience or could be because it's botched but you obviously reduce fat I mean that just sounds like really common sense but yet when you have my machine door for you and your not look
 at it and optimizing it even with common sense then that's how the bad guys keep getting away with it right and so the other example of how this can go wrong is that the Box can fake anything that you want to see so for example if you say oh I want higher click-through rates the Box can generate more clicks and therefore get you higher click-through rates and then if you start to optimize your media without really looking at it to see if it even makes you know you passed your gut check then you know your algorithms might actually increase the money allocated to sites that show will hire click-through rates are at networks that she'll hire click-through rates but unfortunately those are not real those are all fake clicks so then you're sending more money to the bad guys in the fraudulent networks so that since you know definitely use technology but always have kind of human oversight and always just ask if it passes that the smell test today or your gut check

 we saw the Mirai botnet take down websites like Netflix and outs Twitter not long ago you written about how the proliferation of connected devices in iot will increase add fraud yes because these devices are so easy to take over we saw them we saw them taken down Netflix and Twitter and you know as bad as that was there's also like the harm of of just running a browser on these connected devices and having them click on ads and less sounds harder to police then Cloud servers that are correct ones that come from residential IP addresses and all these devices are coming out of the residential IP address so there's millions and millions more of those than Datacenter IP address it's right so that's one
 point and eat the other point is at these devices typically are you know kind of old simple versions of Linux there is never any kind of malware software installed on it or antivirus software it's all on it and then oh by the way all of them use default passwords from the factory right so I mean and because the sheer number of those is just so much more than the number of PCS right I mean we went from PCS and laptops to mobile devices and we jumped up two orders of magnitude my 300EX more mobile devices than there are desktop PCS and laptops right now when we go to iot with you know just literally everything that has a chip in it internet connection that's going to be yet another thousand X increased three orders of magnitude increase in terms of the numbers of devices that you can fall into that category so you know was just a small number of these devices they could take down the other pic of sites I mean that
 application wasn't that they overwhelm the individual sites they took down DNS directions to way to take down many many sites at the same time but none-the-less that was a proof-of-concept to show that even a small number of these is very weak devices but if you just get enough of them strong together he can mount an attack that can you don't really overwhelmed sites but I kind of jokingly say you know sometimes the bad guys might even want a DDOS their own site because if they have ads on it is going to make him a whole ton of AD Revenue so previously you know I talk about these spots these are the same box that were used for DDOS attacks in the past by simply overwhelming a site with it too much traffic to bring it down but that wasn't lucrative now they can use the same Bots hit the web pages that carry ads and they can make a whole ton of money from it so it's way way more lucrative use of the bot stand just DDOS attack someone's someone's website right so bad guys are in
 game and more and more bad guys are getting in on the game as well and there's also like the bizarre question of fake news is that what's clear what's been made clear the past month or so mother to is that people want fake news they want to read fake news whether it's a bad thing or good thing people want to read it at so it's so troubling because you know now there's even more now that not only is the is the profit motive clear but there is in the in this makes it so this makes it harder for like Google or Facebook or an adverb add exchange to police fake traffic on these fake sites because there's lots of legitimate traffic going to these fake sites PS only want to see I want to see the ads and no show. Ashley want to see the ads I mean these are humans and and fake news is just the latest round of clickbait by so a lot of the other kind of
 those that you go without rain kind of things are more like clickbait writes a half naked women and that you know you drive your curiosity by making some some headline that salacious or whatever show humans you click through on those but these days you don't have to wait for the unsuspecting humans to click through on it right you can have plenty of bots those are much easier to create by the millions and you sell them on a CPM faces so they really don't have to wait for us making humans to do that but to me you know all the stuff around fake news to me is no new news because say content has been around since the beginning of Internet advertising right so years and years ago when you know I'm searching for reviews on an HDTV I clicked you on a search result only to find myself on basically a fake site that had assembled a bunch of pictures and words that tricked the search engines so that they would show up high in the organic search results right so when I click through on that accident way that generator page view
 you should have taken you don't ruin the add review on the ads right but again that was an unsuspecting human clicking through the fake content that was assembled for the purpose of attracting you know clickbait right but these days again with the proliferation of programmatic and with proliferation of these tools that can be no legitimate tools that can be used for a legitimate purposes like these developer tools used spots they literally don't care it's such a small volume of humans actually accidentally clicking through or even wanting to click through on the state news that doesn't make them enough my the fox make them orders of magnitude more money on the on the app front brakes it that's much more scalable it's much more automated you know they don't rely on him again years ago they did have click farms in Thailand India right there's some funny videos made of that were humans are just click click click right on ads and on web pages but again humans are not scalable so it's way easier
 now to just spit up a whole bunch of box and data centers and you generate billions upon billions of fake ad Impressions that humans are such a small part of that Revenue that they don't care about that anymore what about ad blockers what are the effect of ad blockers on the advertising ecosystem so unfortunately ad blockers have just further reduce the address of new of good Publishers they sell the good publisher is like to her Sakana Nast Emeritus all that they've been hurt for the last 10 years price of the first wave was digital siphoning traffic away you know so so now there's alternatives to the magazines and then more recently with problematic you know Steven further ad revenues are being siphoned off to these low-cost sites that works for them it's like it's not their fault but when a human has a bad at experience on one of these long till sites
 I so want to go to these long till sites they do unscrupulous things like put 35s on the page or they might get malware or something so when a human has a bad at experience on one of these long tail sites that's going to trigger them to install an ad blocker but then when they come back to Wall Street Journal on ESPN or Conde Nast website ad blocker still on rice with no fault of ESPN Wall Street Journal that human has now loading an ad blocker and now that's causing a revenue decrease on legitimate Publishers so it's really a bad thing for the system that we can't solve by doing what they called and reinsertion right so they are now a whole story of companies out there this is all we can help you detect the ad blockers and oh by the way we're going to help you reinsert the ad he does some will say oh yeah we're going to ask the permission of the consumer first but you know it's it's going to further piss off a consumer and a
 that's something you could probably sure should you or would want to do
 you have an excerpt from an ad app Nexus report in one of your slide shares that I saw at Nexus is a big advertising exchange you were discussing some of the things that you you think they're doing right what should the different players in the advertising industry be doing to improve what did you admire about what app Nexus is doing I would give them too much credit I think they they had to do what they did otherwise they would have lost all their clients for a long time that the main problem was that in the effort to grow as fast as possible I have these at exchanges let everybody in and ultimately that men's a whole bunch of fake sites in front sides and all I kind of got into the network and started running their ads so you know at some point last year so it 2015 they took it upon themselves to clean that out so that was good that's commendable an action on their part and that chart was what they ended up Hubbell
 right he got it at exchange article written about that to say that they cleaned up 92% of their inventory I said they went from 260 billion adding fractions to 20 billion at Impressions 92% decrease and then they at the same time increase their CPM prices by 800% right so for all intensive purposes they didn't make less Revenue but basically I ask a question what the heck where those advertises buying before they did the cleanup so wild that was Noble of them to do that I don't miss I feel too sorry for them cuz I didn't make much less Revenue after that bites the other stuff that the network should be doing are the very things that they're not doing because they don't have the financial motive just like we were talking about earlier they all have inverted incentives to keep the status quo instead of actually aggressively reducing the fraud
 what's interesting about this industry is that it's not selling advertising doesn't work advertising does work it has value but the way the things are set up right now or jets it's impossible to just blindly throw money at a problem and get advertising to work the way you wanted to correct do you think that or are we in the midst of a bubble do you think that things are going to change you think there's going to be some dramatic event that makes their change or what that's going to be this is not going to be a slow deflation event this is going to be a bubble bursting or Asia House of Cards collapsing yes. That's the only way it can work because everything up till now has been I mean it's essentially collusion right it's basically even good players not really acting aggressively to solve the problem but once there's enough of that
 it's kind of catalyst the entire chain reactions going to happen and it can't happen slowly because it's either a good guy with you make me a good publisher that actually has humans die or not it's it's very very clear where it becomes unclear is because a lot of the industry trade associations that language the standards have made it less clear and not more clear so when we could find something like a threshold I'm going to deliberately avoid saying which standard professional I'm talking about when we Define something as a threshold it's some arbitrary Threshold at a committee decided on that's actually making things less turn transparent and less easy to pick out the good from the Bad and the opposite right so in that case those standards didn't help in fact it's help perpetuate the fraud and other bad stuff so as I said earlier digital
 has not fulfilled it's true promise yet because of all these problems because it's not being used in the right way it's not being used in the most efficient way right so part of that comes from the fact that a lot of advertisers are still approaching digital with a reach and frequency mentality which is which is held over from TV and traditional advertising myself in those traditional channels it's all about reaching frequency right how many people can you show your ad to how often that going to sell but by applying the frequency mentality 2 digital were using digital and wave at suboptimal digital is a very good direct response Channel and the very simple thing that I always sites in both class and in the webinars I give his you know what a consumer sees any at what date on TV are printer any app the next thing that they go do is search for more information right and they would search more vigorously if it's a big ticket item or
 complex product that they want more information about right there probably not going to do much research on a can of soda or whatever but nonetheless to default have it is to go online and look for further information when the consumer wants it so that sense if you think about the offline channels and the baby theme or Brandin like parts of the digital channels like display ads video ads those can generate awareness but you need other things to help you harvest the demant I see when someone's looking for information you need search ads to get your brand in front of them or you need content on your own website so that they can actually click through and go read read up on something and get the answers that they want it so in this case programmatic it's just a symptom of that because it's allow big advertises she just buy more and more and more and when you buy more and more inventory slots are happy to generate as much inventory as you want to buy because there's kind of an infinite supply of
 where's there's not an infinite Supply a real humans going to web pages and looking at stuff right so as long as advertisers have that mentality of reach and frequency and they applied at two digital then even that's going to help perpetuate the fraud because the other just asking for more more Impressions and more more each and the Bots are you know very happy to oblige because they can generate as much Impressions and reaches you want to see are you optimistic about the future of advertising online I am I mean until I got into the ad for sorry I've been to Die Hard Optimus and even now I am The Optimist because I do think the digital can be used better digital can show a better outcomes and I get to let me use one more simple exam myself if half of the traffic to your website is generated by Bots right and then you have a certain conversion rate aiso say for example your conversion rates
 now 7% if you cut out half of that traffic that came from Bots right in the conversion rate equation right will you have the number of conversions / the traffic if you reduce the denominator the conversion rate is going to go up so what you're seeing right now when there is by traffic coming to your site is an artificially depressed conversion rate is lower than it should be because you have this number of conversions for this great quantity of traffic if you cleaned up the box and you are left with the humans write his boss don't convert Humans Do Right the end up buying something or doing whatever conversion of that you're looking at then your conversion rate is going to be actually more accurate and more reflective of reality I should when you have humans coming to your site and they convert then that conversion rates would be much more accurate so that sends a lot of the stuff that the lot of the analytics that and advertising agencies are seeing
 hey in digital are artificially depressed right so don't say why is my digital conversion so crappy and I'll say all well maybe I should just go back to using traditional Channels cuz I'm really not getting my tax return schedule so as we clean up the fraud as we start to reduce the body activity then the act of the measurements analytics are going to get more accurate and when that happens then we're going to move towards the original promise of digital so that now advertisers using digital more correctly right as it more direct response oriented neck and channel are going to actually see better results from it so they're using offline channels and other branding like things in digital to generate awareness but they're also using digital to harvest the demand as well so not sense you know digital has yet to fulfill its potential but I'm optimistic that it will once we're able to clean up all this kind of frog

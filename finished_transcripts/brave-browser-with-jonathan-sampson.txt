Transcription: online advertising enables free content and services on the internet one of the free services that is powered by advertising is the browser 60% of web browsing is done through Chrome which is owned by Google which is powered by advertising the application that most of us used to explore the web is made by a company that relies on ads so it is unsurprising that the default of that browser is to allow close tracking of user behavior when you hit a website a variety of trackers are logging your data for the purpose of serving you better ads some people don't like ads and they don't like being tracked but what's the alternative how else can we get all the content we want since the 90s Engineers have envisioned and internet powered by micropayments a micro payment system in your browser would allow users to pay for content with money instead of adtech
Brave is a web browser built with a modern view of advertising privacy and economics Brave users can pay for content with their money or by paying attention to ads this system is formalized through the basic attention token a cryptocurrency that can be used to purchase user attention which is essentially what advertisers want to do
 Jonathan Sampson is a senior developer Relations Specialist with brave software and he joins the show to talk about the problems with the modern browsing experience and what Braves doing to stop it if you like this episode we've done several other shows about privacy and we did a previous show about Brave and web assembly with Brendan eich who is the CEO of Brave if you want to find these old episodes you can download the software engineering daily app for iOS you can easily discover old episodes of my interest you and get recommendations based on what you have listened to so far the app is open source it's at github.com software engineering daily and if you want to contribute to it we would love that there's also several other apps you can contribute to we've got a web front-end we've got an Android app that hopefully will get out the door soon for you Android listeners and we've got a back-end recommendation system API so this is Annie
 and I were hoping to build out and we would love to get your contribution if you like to pack on open source software you go to github.com software engineering daily and with that let's get on with this episode
 who built the kinds of things developers want to build today they need better tools super tools like a database that will grow is your business grows and is easy to manage that's why I amazon-web-services built Amazon Aurora a relational database and that's compatible with my sequel or postgres sequel everybody's up to five times the performance of standard my sequel on the same Hardware Amazon Aurora from AWS can scale up to millions of transactions per minute automatically grow your storage up to 64 terabytes if need be and replicate 6 copies of your data to three different availability zones Amazon Aurora tolerates failures and even automatically fixes them and continually backs up your data to Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS fully managers at all so you don't have to if you're already using Amazon RDS for my sequel you can migrate to Amazon Aurora with just
 if you clicks so what you're getting here is up to five times better performance than my sequel with the security availability and reliability of a commercial database all at a tenth of the cost no upfront charges no commitments and you only pay for what you use checkout Aurora AWS and start imagining what you can build with Amazon Aurora from AWS that's Aurora.

 Jonathan Sampson is a senior developer Relations Specialist with brave software Jonathan welcome to software engineering daily we had a show with Brendan eich who's the CEO of Brave a while back and it was really fascinating and that's what we mostly focused on webassembly and the future of the web in this episode where more talking about what Brave is doing on the browser platform but before we get to the browser itself let's talk about the state of the web as most people see it what are the biggest problems with the modern web
 what year did you see Carnival in the last I don't know 6 years 7 years or so this this gradual rise of ad blockers and stuff like that because the webbys itself is largely been free too many of us know we pay to get the access to our local ISP but for the most part we don't pay for any of the services in content that we consume on the web and so those you know content providers in creators they turn to fairly decent models of advertising online and it's been it's been pretty nice for the most part I think Brenda and terrible podcast have this was just an accident of the web as well as the way in which that the ads and tracking and stuff is kind of cool if rated over the years but things have really gotten kind of out of hand and so now you have ads that are coming packed with very burdensome scripts sometimes they have nefarious purposes their tracking you the tracking new many of them can be actually looking into your file system to figure out what type of programs are running and so this type of thing is just growing more and more out of control
 and this is the very thing that she know very sad blockers have started to try and answer UniFirst mute people typically run those in their browser today but Brave decided to go one step further and actually build a browser that is engineer to come first or quality to the web and then free the user from that the burden of these burned some ads and crackers and stuff we're working on today so I've been reporting on the fraud in the advertising business the online advertising business a lot of the main victims of advertising fraud or actually the advertisers themselves because they end up paying for display advertising that is only viewed by a boat's or it's you know it's here that they're reporting that the advertising agency or the attack ad tech company delivers back to the advertiser
 oh yeah we showed it to this user but in reality the display was hidden behind another ad seen all kinds of scams like this you're actually talking about the user side problems of this where there you know when ads actually get delivered to a user user does see Dad but the ad is a agent for malware or tracking which is not even like you know you're not even getting really shown you know by this kind of soap or by this cereal or by the soft drink it's like the advertising is just this third-party platform for brokering information and diving into the user's computer multifaceted you know there is a there are issues that playing the end-user their issues at play The Advertiser their issues and actually played everyone and just across the Spectrum and so the first thing that brave setup
 did was go to browser which would can I come to the aid of the end-user give them the ability to free themselves out of you know what's happening and so as you mentioned you there are a lot of and see them in fact a lot of times not even ads that are the problem and so we know if you look into I think it was New York Times did a study we're up to 50% of your mobile data was as in trackers so it may not even be something that you're seeing on your screen that is eating up your battery life chewing through your data usage and all the only costing you you know for most phone users new tens of dollars in I think it was about $23 or so a month on average for ads and crackers and so that the problem has gotten really out of hand on that side of the spectrum but then as you're pointing out there's a lot of Fraud and there's a lot of people being hurt or trying to conduct legitimate business I am going to bring their products to Market and it's it's really something that's you know we've been can looking at full spectrum and so you know we launched the attention token
 which is a way to kind of address the other end of the spectrum you know for users who do want to engage in the ad Market how can we ensure that it says you know proper and fair and works at equitably everybody all across the board and said that said that one another area where I can into knots on basic attention token. Org for anyone who wants more information about that particular side of the thing later
 talking more about the modern web most of the sites that I spend significant time on throughout the internet they have their advertisements in their load times under control I using glitter I use Facebook I use quora there are many times when I'm browsing one of these walled Gardens and I click on an external link and it is kind of painful that load time to the so you know whatever the media site that soften hosted on WordPress or I perhaps it's use well yeah usually it's a WordPress that usually goes out to a WordPress site but the WordPress site has all these ads and stuff in it worth or some other CMS just it hasn't been engineered right in the you know that the engineers have just put blobs and blobs of JavaScript they make it load slowly but again most of my time is spent on these walled Gardens
 keep the site pretty clean and performant Dulce problems with those Walled Garden sites or is the is the concern of the the the problematic ads ecosystem does that mostly exist more across what we called like the open web which is Big B's WordPress sites in these other cms's in these news sites and says one thing and it's nice when sites have very performance you know add structures and everything than that actually bog in the page down there not causing Antonio to have any unnecessary Jank to load adds and trackers the day even if someone is loading bad code very efficiently there still a problem and so we want to make sure that users are not being Mia leveraged against their will that they're not being pried upon. They have in their their machine scrutinized if even done efficiently and so there's there's that part of the problem where they're still doing some fairly nefarious things they're still you know selling at
 it's to outside agencies who are able to do some very terrible things as well and then there's also the issue for for advertisers you know you have this giant duopoly for me to wear pretty much all of the ads online order are handled through Google and through Facebook and that causes other types of problems as well for four people and so you know it's definitely very important thing but that's just me I guess the facade of the issue is the very first layer that then needs to be examined and once that's examined and I kind of done away with are still a few other considerations I need to be given always in this area the thing that excites me so much about Brave one of the things is this notion that it will become much easier to do micro payments across the internet and I think we're seeing a germ of how useful this is with patreon patreon is this platform where you can subscribe to pay people on a regular basis to produce content
 and it is really a promising sign that so many content producers are actually able to make a total living off of patreon and you know I think Brendan who is the CEO of Brave I think what he was working on Netscape back in the day he was one of the earliest engineers at Netscape where he helped build JavaScript or architect of JavaScript I think they were trying to do something with micro payments but they couldn't figure out how to make it work is that accurate what's the history of micro payments in the browser not actually a positive about the Netscape days. You know back then that the vast majority of online Commerce. In my experience in this was actually a few years later about 96-97 was largely PayPal you know they had popped in kind of in parallel to eBay and stop an independent Factor stand for online payments and then sending money around
 working on but as you mentioned today you have this new people have been sticking out of ways to support content creators and then maybe even more directly than just you know through ads and stuff were they only catch a very small percentage sometimes of the actual Revenue itself and the money gets sucked up in third-party players in that type of stuff is definitely very interesting of the ability to make pattern of continual routine donations to somebody for the work that they're doing and that's definitely Brave where you were going to allow people to block ads and crackers and that is for their safety but at the same time that maybe a little overstepping than what they're comfortable with and it may actually start to block you know some good content on the web know there are some ads that better okay in a person's first party ads are generally more safe than third-party ads and so we wanted to give people the ability to still support content creator
 and support their favorite websites while they're blocking potentially harmful ads that are coming through on those sites and so brave payments was integrated into the browser and this was initially based on the Bitcoin where we had partnered with the company and you know you could purchase some Bitcoin in the browser and we we made it very simple we don't have to explain the blockchain didn't have to explain cryptocurrency see anybody you just took your card and bought $5 worth of bitcoin and then you started browsing the web and I think it was very key to the success of this model was to make it very simple and straightforward and then familiar to people and so yeah that whole platform is kind of Shifting today to the attention token which is going to give us for more power and it's going to make this a quite a few improvements that are coming outlined in the white paper on his website and in more so but the model itself is fantastic let the users go directly to the content providers and contact producers and that's exactly the kind of facilitating Foster moving for
 people are used to using Safari or more like the Chrome perhaps Firefox these are the browser that people use they all have plug-in platforms why do we need a new browser in tirely to solve these kinds of issues that we've been discussing for example why do we need why do we need a browser instead of an ad blocker why do we need a browser to do payments instead of using patreon to support those users for their payments and it's one that pretty much everybody has when they hear we'll Brave does and blocking them in their initial response is why I have Adblock Plus so why do I need that 90% of the way there but the ads are still dependent upon the the underlined API system of the browser and what the browser is willing to permit the ads to do and in the case of some companies which make the
 bread and butter off of ads this kind of a conflict of interest there will they let you do everything you need to do moving forward or where they restrict certain api's and I've ever stop and so by having control over the entire browser itself from the core out to the externals all the way up to the new add sister the M the add-on system know we get to bake make any changes we seem to fit the necessary to achieve are in Gholson so we just one of the examples is a lot of people don't like the new present the growing presence of auto play media on the web and there wasn't really a great way to stop that inherently at the core and so we went ahead and made some modifications to the chromium engine itself inside Brave so that we could prevent how to play media from ruining your web experiences you just pop into a website that we were just an extension on top of the browser and so by having that additional reach into
 for the browser we can definitely go in your Leaps and Bounds further than mere extensions can in all across the board
 it you mentioned that brave is annexed is it's a fork of the Chromium browser that which is the I think the core of Google's Chrome browser what are the pros and cons of using chromium as the basis to build a new browser on top of a successful as i e was back in the 90s what they are doing extremely well and as a result people kind of expect the web to work the way it works in the in the engine that they use which there is a spot blanket it is itself a derivation of the chromium engine and so the idea of Maximum web compatibility we want the new browser to just start working out of the box for people to work the way they've always expected the web to work so they don't have a bunch of broken pages and and other issues and so we have chromium was kind of the the default standard or the de-facto standard on the web and so that's what we
 I decided to to move forward with I think it might have been some early engineering efforts around trying to use me on Firefox internals and build off of the work over there but the decision was made to go ahead and proceed down with chromium so what we were doing was forking electron which was itself a project to bring a native desktop experience in a frappe locations built upon web Technologies so they use the V8 JavaScript engine and they use the blink engine from chrome and they let you build a seemingly native applications on the desktop from web Technologies like HTML CSS JavaScript and so we decided to actually work electron and today that became you on and so you know we continue to build upon the efforts of many of the Great Engineers working in the space and it's it's really I have a nice relationship we get to inherit allow the great work they do as we discover bugs in and in a feature that need to be worked on in the browser in the court engines we can send those back Upstream to the
 other projects and so it's kind of it in your beautiful symbiotic relationship that we see in nature Show Chrome eventually gets to reap some of the benefits of the engineering efforts of the Brave team we have sent them up to electron in the past Frances when we find a bug in the electron that in your source code and stuff but if we find an issue and chromium as well that is definitely something we have the opportunity of floating up to them and you know if it gets accepted that it gets accepted but I think we have more I accepted your request from electron than we do chromium to my knowledge out and Discord and stuff like that that are working on those ITS Technologies absolutely
 who do you use for log management I want to tell you about scalar the first purpose-built log management tool on the market most tools on the market utilize text indexing search and this is great for indexing a book for example but if you want to search logs at scale fast it breaks down scaler built their own database from scratch and the system is fast most of the searches take less than a second infected 99% of the queries execute in less than a second that's why companies like OkCupid and giphy and Careerbuilder use scalar to build their log Management Systems you can try it today free for 90 days if you go to the promo URL which is software engineering daily.com scalar s c a l l y r
 that's software engineering daily. Com scalar scalar was built by one of the founders of rightly which is the company that became Google Docs and if you know anything about Google Docs history it was quite transformational when the product came out is this was a consumer-grade UI product that solve mini distributed systems problems and had great skill ability which is why it turned into Google Docs and so the founder of Riley is now turning his Focus to log management and it has the consumer-grade you why it has the skill ability that you would expect from somebody who built Google Docs and you can use scalar to monitor key metrics you can use it to trigger alerts immigration with pagerduty and it's really easy to use it's really lightning fast and you can get a free 90-day trial by signing up at software engineering daily. Com
 / s c a l y r software engineering daily.com scalar and I really recommend trying it out I've heard from multiple companies on the show that they use scalar and it's been a real differentiator for them so check out scalar and thanks to scale for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily
 you know and it's an interesting point that you use electron to build off of what is electron satisfy that chromium does not satisfy I guess I'm I'm interested in and understanding the event diagram between electron and in chromium basically of chromium it is chromium but it is also some additional binding the stuff on top of it and it's basically just a means by which any web developer in the end I mean that literally any web developer out there can build their own desktop application using HTML CSS and JavaScript where as you know with with other various browsers and they have worked on a couple in the past as well one in particular you have to learn a whole nother set of Technologies in order to work on the you why and you got to be a C plus plus programmer and used to be quite a bit of other
 things to really be successful and work on that browser with brave it is basically a super web page so if anyone is running Brave right now and you pressed shift f8 you would notice that it opens up familiar Dev tools what you're used to seeing if you're inside Chrome and um yeah right click and go to inspect element you'll actually see the dev tools for the Dom of the browser herself until Brave is a react JavaScript application using jsx instead of HTML and it is letting us use all these familiar and time-tested technologies that have been operating websites and web applications for many years to actually build a browser itself and that's something that made possible by the initial efforts of the electron team react at its core for the UI you know this is somewhat of a tangent but I'm sure you have been seeing the debates over the Apache license for
 react to people are concerned because I think I'm not totally up-to-date on this but Facebook shows not to give it a very open licensing to react and so there are some open source audio logs that are arguing that if you want your project to be safe from Facebook filing a lawsuit against you have some kind you should not use react have you been following this at all I personally haven't the vast majority of my focus is around engineering efforts but that is that I'm certain if there is a discussion in that space that we have someone who's probably looking into that side I wouldn't I'm not too concerned about it but I definitely could find someone probably on the team that you know is this thinking more along those lines and I am okay so brave blocks ads by default I believe and
 I take a nap process it's sometimes you make a mistake in terms of what you block and what you prevent the page from loading I know my Adblock Plus occasionally yeah I go to a page and suck the page doesn't load properly like a fraction of the page ilysm I got what's going on here and I like okay disable Adblock for this page and it actually works so I know that like the ad blocking process is not perfect what are the heuristics that brave uses to block ads look for any HTML element how do you know that that's an ad
 so there are a couple different efforts in this space to play around at blocking there are the network level heuristics where you're trying to infer based upon the request in the response of this is something that needs to be loaded on the user's machine and then there's the the Dom level or that you I spaced it you're talking about where you're examining and scrutinize in the actual document object model itself for the on-screen elements to say okay does this really need to be here in particular you might have a container for a banner that got blocked and now the banner is just sitting there vacant and empty and you might actually want to close those too and so you have the static in those network-level heuristics and so typically Block in general all third-party ads so if you're on food.com and if something is trying to be loaded from bar.com we Stickley block that and so if you're loading first party as you probably not see any Interruption to your ass
 ecosystem at all because we typically leave first party hats alone what are the things that we do though is the the ad block in the takes place in things I can block class in some of the other Adblock utilities operate off of public lists and so were able to consume the same list to themselves and is lizard you know that you're rated and maintained by the community so there's a great deal of five distributed efforts and and crowdsourcing that goes into this and it's one of the levels as well that we take in consideration and it will be scrutinized in the list and see if the URL that you know is it serving the ad is a known offender that their Servants of the malicious then we can block based on that we also do some other things where we might permit script to be loaded on the machine but then we're going to scrutinize it as its operator and so another thing that you see in the ad ecosystem is fingerprinting where particular ads want to track you specifically As you move around on the web and so they want to learn
 much information about you as possible and one of those things that they can do is I generate a unique hash from new canvas a pie or something like that and then so this digital fingerprinting takes place and we look for those types of things as well and we prevent them before they run and that way you are not you are not distinct from the rest of the traffic online so that people can't track you particularly around the web and so there's a couple different that you know the steps inside their the application of publicly consumable lists you know those network-level heuristics looking at the actual code in operation Lambert's running or an execution rather and blocking some of the malicious patterns that would typically see their as well
 let's get into the basic attention token explain what the basic attention token is
 so as we're talking before there's this entire ecosystem online of ads and then this is basically it's the way the web works and you know you can love it or hate it but you can't really do anything about it the way the web operates on the ads but there's a great deal of fraud as you mentioned before is a great deal of burdensome performance issues and invasive tracking and ads and that is one of the space at Brave is kind of introduce the attention token which is this attempt to reform this ad tech industry in and make it good again and I said it's it's gotten kind of wayward a little bit and so the attention token is a blockchain a blockchain based at means by which we can ensure you know better quality add so we can ensure no leaking of user data whenever we're trying to match users to add sit if this is an entirely opt-in system I should say at the very beginning here I said this is not something where you going to turn on Brave and people will start seeing ads
 but it's basically the effort to 2 to fix the evil ad Tech online someone with a basic attention token in my wallet what can I do with that so ideally it's going to continue to work the way Brave payments has worked in the past where you can just continue browsing and let's say you have you know 5 bats or basic attention token in your wallet and at the end of the month you we can say OK you visited websites you spent this this amount of time I need a website where she break it down into percentages and stuff and you can say Okay I want to distribute my monthly allowance of bats to these sites proportional to the amount of time I spent on them you could do that or you can actually say you know there's one site in particular I really love I want to donate you know 5 bat to the Wikipedia every month because I go to Wikipedia all the time I want to make sure they always get 5 that every month so you can actually set up a a a fixed amount recurring donation as well
 you can actually in addition to the regular monthly payment you can make donations to websites as well actually support people just out of the goodness of your heart because you want to and so we're trying to really offsets the dependent upon the old adtech model and create something new that sustainable and has legs was going to run and so in parallel to this one of the things were going to doing with actually a new ad model is and I mentioned this before without the without having to leak information about users and user machines is engaged local client-side machine learning so actually been able to inside the browser examine where you go what you look at how you browse and do it in such a way that nobody knows and that includes brave brave software weed we don't get access to any information from your browser as well and that this is great because it allows you to opt into an ad system that is going to be
 cater to your browsing needs to your interest and it's going to do so without leaking information about who you are immune to the to the web itself which is what happens today and so it's it's definitely a very exciting model you know what we're making great strides we released a road map from your recently on the bat website basic attention token. Org and people can go there and see basically what we're expecting to the composition and when were expecting to have accomplished it
 what's the difference between paying for content with dollars through micropayments in the browser and paying for content with basic attention token
 lyric I guess numerous difference is but one of the great things I Like About That blockchain Base Solutions and that is near the bad itself is based on that I believe it's the erc20 token model standard and one of the great things about this is is it is nearly instantaneous transfer of mineral baths in this case and there's very little overhead so we had set up before where you could purchase Bitcoin and this was in a requiring you to spend some of your money and stuff we wound up noticing that the cost to purchase Bitcoin in size to this concert was just throwing up exorbitantly because their credit card processing fees and all this type of stuff and it just it kind of gets out of hand and so with with bad you don't have to worry about making credit card transactions you don't have to worry about any of that was happening every month you don't have to worry about middleman can jacking up their prices you just have this decent
 flights Ledger and I can now transfer you know 5 bat to Jeff and I don't have to worry about paying it a great deal of overhead yeah there are obviously if you're a minor in the community another minor as in you're underage but if you're a minor as in someone who has a note on the network who's actually you know performing the math work there's a little bit of a note added money in there for you and you know I'm not quite sure if we're going to have the same concept of gas that the aetherium has but there's always different ways that people can make a little bit extra money on the side but the appeal to me is we don't have the burden of the old system and the way in which it works you know I don't have to worry about paying 3% or 5% or something like that in order to make simple transactions between me and one other individual the property of being able to make several transactions without going to the credit card processing world or something like that
 that makes complete sense and I would love to have that in my browser to do my car payment without having this onuris transaction cost couldn't I do the same thing with Jean I guess I'm a bit unclear to me why I can't do that with a theory and more Bitcoin I've ever think like if I sit down to two Brave and what kind of browse to use Brave is my browser for the next 3 months and so I'm just going to buy $30 in ethereum or Bitcoin or basic attention token what's the difference between basic attention token and the other two off Springs yeah this is a a more technical topic that I don't know that I would be the best person to discuss some it's all right all I can do is point people to our white paper my focus is gentle and development brave but I have a growing interest in the Bakken base Technologies and the event itself is something that is it something that we get to control within the attico system it's built specifically for reform
 high tech industry and so there's a lot of nuances and everything that would be outlined in the white paper that I I don't know that I would be the best person to to come to cover that
 I sell podcast ads and podcast ads are a weird commodity many of my potential customers are not actively looking for podcast at so I can reach out to them with a cold email this cold email process is what lots of people go through whether they are marketing a software product a newsletter or an online course I know there are a lot of people who are listen to this who are building some kind of new software product and they're trying to figure out how to sell it if you're building your own business you have to learn to sell and if you're going to sell you have to learn to prospect prospecting is the process of gathering email addresses and sending messages to potential customers Prospect. IO is my favorite tool for prospecting you can find email addresses of people at any company you can find email addresses of users on LinkedIn after you find those emails you can use Prospect Ohio to manage your prospects and to
 send emails you can see when somebody opens your prospecting email and you can stop sending those emails when they have signaled that they're not interested if you're building a product you have to find customers to sell to how do you find customers by prospecting I've tried a ton of prospecting tools Prospect Ohio is my favorite Prospect Ohio is offering software engineering daily listeners 20% off your first two months just mention SE daily to prospect IO support after you sign up and if you're selling something tryout Prospect. IO I hope you enjoy it
 well I mean yeah just some hypothetical Things based off what you just said like you know if I if I'm a publisher and and there's an Advertiser that wants to air an ad on my website and the the user and I want to verify the user that viewed that add if I want to have it into end vegetable transaction system then it would make sense to have a domain specific blockchain for you know that even if it's just like The Ledger of transaction does not just like the financial the financial transaction occurs but it's also the attention transaction that occurs if any part of the problem that occurs with the current ad Tech model is that there's a lot of middleman and you know when you when there's an impression that's going to be served somebody there might be 3 or 4 different players between the advertiser and the person who is seeing the app
 and the transactions that the middleman transactions between the person and the person at the person in the advertiser who's trying to show the add to that person it's an opaque hand off of different of information from from person a person B and an in that opacity there is so much room for fraud that's the problem so you know I'm just riffing here maybe I should probably do another show about the basic attention token what I can think of all kinds of applications that would help to bring transparency or even just standardization to a world videos very much unstandardized sort standardized only to the extent that it can exploit The Advertiser news about that General model and some of the problems at the the bat aims to fix there is a short 2-minute video or something like that on basic attention token. Org our Brendan eich himself actually going to sit down and talk very high level
 about the project and it's it's it's goals in Ames and as you pointed out there's just the system is unfortunately front with that with fraud and middleman and it's it's pretty nasty when you start to go back the covers and look at it and so there's definitely a great deal of potential for bat to to do some serious good in that space and we're very very excited about moving forward with him again saying you are sure about but it is there a roll for the middlemen ad tech companies in in in the world that the bat and braver trying to create you know for Middle minute I'm not really quite sure that the idea behind a more simplified advertising model is you have the advertiser you hear about the end-user you have the content producer in the office this simple harmonious relationship not burdened by a bunch of additional stuff sitting on the network yes and so the idea
 Simplicity in and get away from me of the more complex a bee sting that has grown out of that over the knee of the last decade or so and said yeah it's it's a great question you know advertising isn't my forte but it's something I'm I'm very much interested in obviously it's a very close effort to the brave project and so I can watch with eager anticipation of it now I'm sitting at a friend's house the other night and he is a non-technical friend who happen to have stumbled onto a Bitcoin documentary and that he called me up at 1:15 a.m. in the morning or so and it was like you got to come over I got to I got to talk about blockchain and so I went over to his house at 1:15 and we just sat there you know talking about the block I am and why it's so exciting you know how this type of technology is really revolutionising many older Industries not the least of which is the attic industry and so near the idea of have
 the stability and the accountability that comes with a suit Anonymous blockchain is is very when Sam is very appealing and so I'm I'm definitely looking forward to continue to watch the bad mature and r-rating and kind of fix the web for everybody I think I saw your Tweet about that he wanted to meet you at IHOP or Waffle House or something this is this guy is he's hardcore you know if he can get you at the waffle house at 2:30 in the morning to scratch out ideas on the back of a napkin he will and so are we definitely all need to have a friend like that course I think I have been that friend more than I've been on there anyway so the tracking stuff you know tracking is one of these things where many times is doing you a disservice sometimes it is doing you for your positive service or like when I'm browsing the internet and for example Amazon is tracking me
 the internet and Amazon ads it was on it seems like it's really start to spend a lot of money on Advertising online because I know this because I'm seeing more and more display ads for Amazon in such an item that like does appeal to me and it's kind of usual cuz I'm like yeah actually kind of do want that and I'm willing to I'm almost willing to click on an Amazon ad because I know it's just go take me to Amazon which is like I don't have a negative affiliation with Amazon and I'm just bringing this up as an example to illustrate that not all tracking is the worst there is some track is a lot of traffic and it's really terrible and you know for all of it for all the complaints that people have about Google or Facebook surveilling you at least these companies have a little bit more of a long-term interest in protecting your information there are much sleazier players that you've never heard of that have as much information as they need to ruin your life as Facebook or Google does but all of these companies want to track you through the internet and you don't answer
 cases like Amazon or Facebook or Google there could be a lot of utility like I think that maybe you can tell me it to what degree Facebook or Google needs to track you through the internet and ordered for you to be able to authenticate with them cuz like when I buy authentic I enjoy authenticating with Google or authenticating with Facebook because it's a seamless experience I don't have to enter my password a bazillion times that seems like a positive dude just Google and Facebook need to track me through the internet in order for me to get that positive login experience
 I don't think so with the first thing primarily so the idea of tracking itself I don't know that anyone likes tracking and principal and that is quite literally someone just stalking you around the web I think we like what we sometimes get from the tracking which is more better targeted ads and so we like the fact that what if you're walking behind me everywhere I go when you're observing everything I do you're going to learn a great deal about me but the same time I'm I'm I'm leaking a bunch of information to you the advertiser or to you that the person telling me ads and so it's it's kind of no one step forward two steps back type of thing and what we did a brave is we're actually thinking well is there a way to have that targeting where you get the ads that you actually want without leaking all that information about yourself about where you go about what you search for about where your vehicle purchasing things because you this is hopped off of the web and now large companies I think alphabet
 has access to a massive amount of credit card transactions are adverse met information about credit card purchases at this point now and they can basically tell what you're buying where you buy it with your your physical card in hand and so you know this this whole thing kind of reminds me of that episode of The Office where Oscar was doing ads for abs and a news watching the documentary on the phone anytime as would come on he would go and he would be a blast as ABS and the way that he actually did it was by hanging upside down from like a chin-up bar with these these gravity boots or something which he says he found through and add themselves so no ads brought him a product that he liked but he also didn't want to continue to subject himself to ads and tracking online and so I think that's what we're looking at is how can we get the same benefits of that for people who want to have targeted ads without leaking information that's
 the areas in which time machine learning client-side within your browser itself is going to be far more powerful and far more impactful than any malicious tracking or or any decide I would say unethical tracking has ever been because machine learning is happening inside the browser the browser knows so much more than what can be beat doubt in your cookies and that type of information the browser knows how you scroll the browser knows you know what you look at where your typing how much me what you are your behavioral characteristics are when you're interacting with the web I ain't no singing what percentage of an ad is on screen and it knows whether not be no ads are occluded by other elements on the page as you mentioned before you know that the browser itself is the Oracle in this space in and it really could be leveraged for people who want to have better targeted ads to achieve that without having to share in an overly the Bulge information about themselves to just out to anybody on the web middleman and
 I like the idea of the client-side machine learning how much of that is has been engineered is is the breaking just thinking about that because I can imagine there would be an issue cuz you know you need a model right you're training a model overtime and if you're doing it client-side I guess you wouldn't have to keep the model client-side you could potentially have the model sitting in the clouds somewhere in the model of somewhat opaque and then you have new information that comes in and gets processed clients side and you figure out how that new information would update the model and you can update the model in the cloud you can do all that without actually sending the raw information back to break up maybe you could just shed some more light on the the engineering or at least the intentions are the plans of the Brave team around that client-side machine learning
 do everything we can without leaking anything yeah that's that's currently the go with what we have implemented today you know this the entire process of this machine learning development effort is laid out in the road map that was published on the basic attention token. Org the first phase is actually already done so you guys you know what is the development process here the first race is xur this done and that was kind of finish in the brave payments launch the browser quite a while back which means that the browser actually has the ability to track where you're going and you know how much time you spend on which sites and do so without leaking that information off to anybody else and then that in turn can translate into a micro donation of the month or something like that so this is going to continue to develop and the actual expected steps are outlined in the road map and South you see we're going to start from just the that primitive basic attention being a recording that we're doing right now
 and moving forward to a finer more granular a process whereby we can actually track okay what types of ads are they interested in are they interacting with how long are those ads on screen are the occluded buy anything else are the visible and it's going to get a lot better you know a lot quicker it's going to be at really fantastic and so that's all they down the road map again and that's actually coming very very soon that's going to see you at the next a development from your point of view how does webassembly affect the future of browsers is actually really excited because it starts to build Bridges where they they didn't previously exist you know you the idea that you can actually cross-compile languages to to operate on the web and I kind of expect to see that Neil pop up more and more in the future you know I'd I spoke last year about do I expect JavaScript to to cease to exist basically and used as we typically have written it and webassembly just to take over and I don't think that's the case I think what will start to CR
 area bike machine learning that might be an area was just so you know right for potential for some of these new languages like C & C plus plus the stuff to actually cross-compile over into code that can actually run in the browser and more efficiently and effectively than then if someone had written in JavaScript begin with and so as browse just continue to do more and more heavy lifting new things that require more and more power and processing I think that is definitely an area that is ripe with great potential and a space
 do you see any fundamental changes to the browser coming as Computing becomes more about the voice interfaces you know that's a really tough one we wanted to get a an Oculus Rift and so we purchased that and he loves playing video games and I love some of the productivity apps and so there's a nap when I called big screen which lets you know basically use your desktop in a virtual space the great thing is you can actually take your knee or small 13 15 inch screen and you can make it a 75-inch screen right around your head and it's amazing the resolution is nice and everything the problem is you can't see your keyboard so you know if your hands float off the home row or something. Were you trying to reach over for your notepad you can't really do a whole lot since you lately find ways to work around that by adding an on-screen keyboard and stuff that you can just know it's basically the hunting pack method where you have two sticks and you can just put buttons on the keyboard
 but the voice interface there is is really interesting because that would be a natural extension of already used to you know even as far back tattoo that I think the nineties we had the Dragon Naturally Speaking software where you would sit down in train your computer to understand your voice and your Microsoft it recently announced I think that they have their error rates down to 5% or something with the speech recognition and so it's getting better and better and of course with the the Advent in the growth of all of these digital assistants you know if Cortana and and the echo I have to be sure not to say the other word other outside trigger my house yes and but you know it is definitely a natural interface and so I firmly expect to see any of that continues to develop its it's already come quite a ways and accessibility community and so it seems only natural that will continue to bleed over into the general community at large and that developed there as well totally unrelated
 to Brave but how productive are you when you do the VR saying cuz this is what I kind of dream about is like it was when I think about what would actually want out of VR is like putting on a headset and having browsers like being surrounded by browsers and being able to be productive without no just staring into this rectangle on my on my desk but that didn t of course the downside is I'm then I am fully immersed and who knows what the health risks of that are any more than maybe 30 minutes to an hour at a time in the VR headset I said the biggest issue is just the lenses fogging up and then you start to lose some of your visibility there's also an issue resolution so you know what I can use Brave in my VR headset for things like navigating get Hub in a reading issues closing issues
 kind of stuff it's a little more difficult to use it for me an actual programming going into Visual Studio code and in writing some JavaScript for instance you can't see your keyboard and secondary because the resolution is is fairly low and so it's it's more noticeable when you're looking at ligatures and characters on the screen and that type of stuff it's less noticeable when you're looking at Giant buttons or you know large paragraphs that have giant font sizes in that kind of thing and so it's it is it's great it's getting better it's not quite there and I'm the thing that I'm primarily interested in these days I guess would be augmented reality space and looking at what like the hololens or something to do and because those are actually able to project over what you can actually see so you still give it to your keyboard still see your mouse you know still see the microphone here before me and you still get the benefit with the of having a thousand screens all around you and spatially aware as to where you put them and where they going to remain and so I'm looking forward to that entire space and that
 7 something that you know I've been using Brave in the Oculus Rift and that our interest is there as well you know wherever you are we want to be and so brave today is available to Windows Mac OS Linux Android iOS and if there's an opportunity to to have a virtual version of the browser that just operates an augmented reality or virtual reality I think that's definitely something we explore as well just wrap up tell me about how to open source Community interacts with brave are there lots of contributors are most of the contributors from within Brave the company open source project so you know what Microsoft we had some open source projects in the past you know with brave we are largely entirely open source I think we're actually entirely open source I don't I don't think there's anything that we have closed Source in a Google as well they'll open source technology bill with all these companies they all have a paid staff and that staff have become experts in their codebase they know where everything is so generally you're going to see
 long-tailed of enumerated developers in and how much they contribute to the project itself so if you look at that but first the very front of that graph there be quite a few people who contribute to Blink who are also employed by Google at Microsoft in the same people working on the chakra engine are also going to be employed by Microsoft in A Brave the vast majority of the contributors who have one or more contributions are going to be employed by Brave that being said we do have a very just awesome Community we have actually with community that break.com where engineers and you lay persons can come and discuss the browser itself we have tons of people who open issues on her behalf they may not be equipped to go and fix the problem but they can at least open an issue for us and get help and let us know about it we even have quite a few people who you know if they continue to engage the team will pull them into a a slack as well so they can actually communicate more directly as if they were one of the team members and selves
 but we have a really kind of beautiful community of developers who work with us and who continue to contribute meaningful ways in the brave browser itself and not to mention a lot of people they have great ideas and they just want to see if they can integrated get it working in praven so we had a friend since you have someone want to see if they can get webtorrent working and now we have the ability to interact with the Torrance in Brave itself and so that's that's really exciting it's built right in we even have someone looking into the ipf faster the interplanetary file system which is a decentralized way to serve websites and files as well and that you were exploring whether not that something I can work inside Brave as well and these are all just people in the community who have great ideas and they want to see if it's something that that is feasible and large it usually is then again that goes back to our access to actually the the chromium source and being able to make whatever changes we went internally to accommodate those types of those types of
 eccentric ideas and things that we want to see how we can push the browser even further that's very exciting and the future of browsers yeah it's been my pleasure as well thanks for having me

Transcription: Swan is a founder of the institute for blockchain studies she has a background in finance computer science medicine art and other topics and she joined suffrage in Daily to discuss the block application to all of these areas thanks for having me use the blockchain so blockchains are the distributed Ledger technology underline Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and more broadly a mechanism for updating truth States in distributed network computing of producing consensus trust and serving as a new form of General computational substrate is as a solution to the Byzantine generals problem what is the Byzantine generals problem the Byzantine generals problem comes quite literally from Byzantium in the year 5:55 when the Byzantine Empire was it at its height of conquering different territories around the Mediterranean and the issue
is communication how do you do Communication in a distributed Network and in this case of monster Byzantine generals where you don't know which might be defecting or otherwise impaired as a note so is it the Byzantine consultas problem is the how do you do trust Apple communication in the distributed Network and that is exactly what we are trying to do in Bitcoin blockchain which is a distributed computing Network I we would like to have trust a bolt Ruth State updating across the network larger class of problems in distributed systems
but what is the double spending problem okay to to keep problems that Bitcoin starts to get around and the first and most straightforward is a double spin problem and then secondly is the Byzantine consensus problem so they're double spend problem is like any digital asset when I send you an email with a photo or document attachment you can make a digital copy of that attachment as many times as you like and that's fine maybe for an image or document but that's not good with money we want money that's only spent once and so there hadn't been we've been trying in the Computing world for decades to come up with a good digital cash solution but there hasn't really been one until blockchain and so what blockchains do is set up a distributed Network where independent parties miners confirm and move the the balance in a wallet address between my wallet in your wallet for example if we're doing a transaction
and only allow that money to be spent once and so that because the blockchain is a distributed network with independent parties confirming invalidating the transactions that gets around the double spend problem I'm so that's that's been really an advent the step forward that blocked chains have been able to do now the other problem that Byzantine agreement is a more is more expensive kind of problem it's a little bit more detailed and there's also been proposed Solutions on this for years and the first ones were from Leslie Lamport at Microsoft proposing taxes and that's a state machine replication algorithm that synchronously updates and network and Google is Chubby algorithm us serve strongly consistent files and also draws on that that first level of Byzantine agreement protocol other issue is that those protocols update and all Network nodes synchronously and in the bigger to Riri
a truly world scale large Network
 in the case of future uses of blockchain Technology we can't depend on synchronous Network update that really needs to be asynchronous and so therefore that's when Block Chain and Nakamoto starts to come in as proposing a solution for Byzantine agreement that's asynchronous and so this is the proof of work algorithm which is by which the blockchain currently runs but it's expensive and high latency and also the proof of stake consensus derivation algorithm has been proposed and is in use but requires has some other potential risks and so the kids can a komodo consensus is we know it's a Sybil attack resistant compromise for decentralized consensus at the moment but it's probably not the final solution for truly world scale distributed network fault-tolerant security because it's just too expensive it has four scalability and high latency
 and so then other consensus protocols have been proposed to the Byzantine agreement problem from Pebble and ripple and Stellar it markets to put a spending problem is essentially the base case example of all the problems that can occur in a multi-user financial Network without a central institution do you grieve that this is true I would agree with that okay and so let's let's start by discussing the blockchain and its most familiar form which is the which is Bitcoin and you touched on how Bitcoin uses the blockchain but could you go into a little more detail
 let's see so let's distinguish between Bitcoin and blockchain to the blockchain it's sort of like if we think about a good analogy is SMTP as a protocol by which email operates and it runs over up on the Internet so if somebody Lily blockchain software is the underlined protocol layers that allow digital transactions to happen and then Bitcoin is one particular application like email it's a cryptocurrency a digital cash application and so we should think of blockchain as the underlined Plumbing the software and Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is as an application layer thing so and then the blockchain itself so it's called the blockchain because that refers to win transactions Bitcoin transactions are submitted their get the software automatically gathers them into blocks of say a thousand transactions at it at a time everyday
 and then it and these transactions are posted together in a block and then blocks are confirmed by Miners and then the next block in the first line always call the address of the previous block so that creates a permanent sequential record and that squat why it's called a blockchain every blockchain has every generally blockchains have a certain structure the things that are true for the true as breakthrough
 yes and and while realizing that there are now public blockchains private blockchains blockchain itself as a computational concept is evolving but the general structure of a blockchain is that it's a software these transactions are packaged into blocks and then a random number is created specific to the block and then metadata about that random number is published to the web and these are its cryptographic around letters it's difficulty a service string an on switch is a 32-bit number and a counter and these are the cryptographic parameters of that block and then anyone running mining software performs computations and submits cryptographic guesses as to the specific knots of this particular block and it's really a trial-and-error computational guessing process and then the mining machine with the correct guess
 when's the right to actually record the transaction and receives the block rewards of the or the transaction fee for doing so distributed throughout the world and yes definitely so one way one way that we can be thinking of black chains is that a blockchain is like a giant interactive Google doc spreadsheet that anyone worldwide can view on demand where independent administrators are minors continually verify and update The Ledger to confirm that each transaction is valid if we all have giant Ledger we all have to have a copy of this these transactions are getting added to it over time doesn't this Ledger get too big for everybody in the network to hold onto a copy of it yes right now so it is Bitcoin and these are open source software
 so that means that anybody can go to get Hub and download the software on a variety of different platforms and there are currently about 7,000 Global nose running the full Bitcoin D your Bitcoin Damon node and you can go to a bit notes. IO and look up which knows these are anytime I'm so and the end the full the nose running the ball Bitcoin transaction love Ledger since the very beginning it's currently about 25 or probably about 30 GB that should run the whole transaction Ledger but there are number of software applications then an ecosystem such that you don't really need to run the whole whole transaction Ledger the whole history of all transactions to actually find out what are updated address balances and valid addresses and things like that so companies like shein.com and other blockchain software ecosystem companies have provided different kinds
 baby eyes to the information on the full blockchain Damon but we were use for much more practical use in application and dated a software wallet operation. For example my my mycelium wallet on my cell phone certainly doesn't have the whole bit is not running the whole full Bitcoin D node but it does have an ability to call information to confirm that my address balance is valid when I'd like to buy coffee for example would you describe the word knots knots knots is a cryptographic yes and as a 32-bit character and so what happens in mining is that in the Bitcoin Network use as proof of work mining so this is the idea of putting in computational work to try to earn a reward and
 to deter malicious players so you had since you have to put in work to possibly win the blockchain rewards if you are malicious agent it's not worth your while and so that's why that's why Bitcoin mining can be expensive and use a lot of electricity is to deter malicious players and how it works is you you just download they mining software package and this package will will track what the latest block parameters are and run cryptographic guesses or hashes per second and so your average the right now the Bitcoin Computing network is actually the biggest supercomputer we've ever had it runs on the order of 380 peda hashes per second as opposed to your average laptop which would be about 1 petahash for her second and so out of nowhere in the last 2 years the Bitcoin network has come and
 how to become the biggest world's biggest supercomputer now so in mining they'll be millions of gases than per second or this particular healer knots or 32-bit character for this particular Block in the block rewards and sewing machines worldwide just just run trial-and-error guesses to try to obtain that result to try to guess that knocks and that keeps the system secure because it's completely unpredictable and unknowable what that knots will be it soft determined by software and then the winning machine the winning gas then and then gets the right to the block Rewards
 defined in terms of Bitcoin is this distributed Ledger that everybody has a copy of and minors are continually
 mining which means that they are attempting to come to a consensus on the status of The Ledger and the incentive that they have to come to consensus on the status of Fletcher is that they will receive more Bitcoin if they work to verify that they have the correct view into the world and that everybody else in the network has the correct you into the world so it's essentially the generalized idea of the blockchain is everybody is incentivized to work towards agreeing on a source of Truth is that all that's fairly accurate yes but the confirmation happens the sequence is a little bit different so the what happens is whoever wins the block reward and recorded the actual transaction then all of the other nodes in the system come and confirm confirm overtime the accuracy of those transactions and do the same
 confirmation so is this is this Wallet balance have this amount and yes it was transferred to this other wallet address and so the confirmations come in time after the moment that the at the Block cuz actually recorded and one thing that's interesting is that So eventually are the consensus comes is all the other nodes confirm the new truth state of the system and that's asynchronous and what's interesting is that the security is a geometric butt and nonlinear progression and that by the time you have another machine and then in a second and third or third or forth and so on as you have additional nose confirming the truth state in the distributed Network it becomes geometrically harder to undo the transaction and so that that's the higher level of security that's confirmed by consensus mechanism like a blockchain
 so I think of a good analogy of her to this is dead in in a system like a Bitcoin the most recent past is like the slushy layer of some sort of Arctic Arctic plain and it's it's slushy it's it's beautiful but the lower layers of of the history the more it is at an icy rigid crust that cannot be changed so it said the recent history more the further you go back and gets exponentially or geometrically I'm not sure what the right word is more difficult than what I see by the does get icy here
 right okay so how do we begin to decouple the idea of blockchain from the idea of mining
 why what would be the purpose or why so as I understand something like ripl for example doesn't need mining it has a different sort of consensus protocol so what I took away from that is that the idea of the blockchain is actually not closely coupled with the idea of mining but maybe I'm mistaken about to watch chains are distributed Ledger technology is just as soft as her to general computing structure for doing any kind of tracking and transfer and how they do that is with consensus mechanisms and Mining is one form of a consensus mechanism and so yes the van in the case of Ripple or Stellar or other kinds of operation that other kinds of blockchain operations may use other kinds of consensus mechanisms
 sure okay so maybe we can we can contrast some of those could you could you start by contrasting Bitcoin blockchain strategy with ripples sure so Ripple is basically a private chain and it's it's not mind so how can something this works is that the different network nodes vote on the veracity of transactions in order to update The Ledger and they have a complicated process of 50% of the nodes need to confirm the veracity or and then it sometimes 80% that was a little bit of a complicated protocol but basically all of the participating nodes and vote on the veracity of incoming transactions at so that so that so that counter is there the problem of the paperwork mining situation which is very expensive
 and Stellar is is similar to that but could we discuss aetherium trimmer yeah definitely work off the Ripple code base and seller is is quite similar they have a two-tier system where first of all they have a a new idea called Coram slicing which is that any new no joining a network any new note can freely join a network as opposed to the Ripple model for example seven Stiller and Nuno joints and at work and looks at 3 or 4 local Pierz MN initially soon and the seams are trustworthy until proven otherwise as this is a quorum slice you don't need to know the whole network but you establish a local slice that you trust yourself and then that's how you get your network updates your updated truth States and then that way if there is a malicious notary malfunctioning note of this owl node as they're called
 then you have your other truth nodes and so anyone note can continually stay updated as to the truth state of the network send the cellar model there's first of all the core and slice that a nooner node Finds Its Own mini trust Network and then the second portion of that is similar to Rick Ebel it as of an old voting on the quality of the truth State updates as the means by which truth State updating actually occurs some differences that actually sounds pretty relevant
 okay maybe but maybe we could look ugly yeah that's fine because they're different use cases so Stellar is contemplated for use in a variety of different kinds of distributed network computing as opposed to Ripple which is designed really for a bank interbank usage so will you usage within Chase Bank and all its notes for example and they would like Chase Bank would like a private blockchain Network to do its internal confirmation that we're Wells Fargo doesn't see it for example and so because of the ripples focusing on the bank clearing and settlement sector in Bank transfers down from 3 days more much more immediate transfers and seller is focusing on a number of different kinds of Industries and different kinds of application and so therefore the consensus mechanism used by both could be different
 I'm done another aspect is this General working and what are what is Lloyd Litecoin darkcoin name coin Bitcoin etcetera and so what what happens is all of these Point projects are open source software and so that's really great because it allows and wrap it in a situation and so have you as a developer looking that's really great and and I'd like to add this other new functionality a new features and so you just you download the Bitcoin Code bait and switch is a fork you for anything before cat over to to do a new code base with your additional functionality and so that's what happened with that's what happens with many cryptocurrencies they off most often have started as a fork From the Block the Bitcoin blockchain software repository and then added additional features that's true for Litecoin and then name going for example is a non currency implementation of Bitcoin initial
 Bitcoin code for the purpose of decentralized ens registration and so it is the subsequent forks and applications don't need to necessarily be currency related also and so the so that's why I Ripple is a fork that's right seller is a fork of the Ripple codebase Litecoin is a fork of the Bitcoin code base and then so there are Ecology of these crypto software projects etherium is a separate blockchain it is also mind it has its own token and the it was just released on July 30th a week ago and already there are over or 61,000 transactions 61000 blocks on the Chain you can look at The Ether chain. Org is the block Explorer for it and in the case of aetherium it's
 it's consensus mechanism is currently approved work consensus mechanism just like Bitcoin but it's envisioned that it will eventually shift when they platform is more mature it'll shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism could you describe the difference between two primary blockchain consensus mechanisms consensus protocols and paperwork is the dumbest actual performance of a computation doing work on straight that you are a bona fide good player agent participating in this network proof of stake is an ownership stake so because I own this server here that I put on the Money Network that is thought to confer the same trustability I'm providing a proof of stake so both organs both both are cases of a proof of something of proof of some sort of ability or
 capacity to participate in this network and poop of work I'm doing some work and proof of stake I'm providing an actual asset
 right so that wasn't very excellent crisp explanation so I would eventually like to get into some of the higher level economic implications of blockchain Technology do you write about so much but first I would like to talk a little bit about interesting societal aspect vitalik buterin the creator of aetherium you strikes me as this is an excellent leader which I find interesting because there's a tension in the decentralisation community between do we need leaders or do we not need leaders because you know that's the whole idea of decentralisation is you don't need centralized institutions in the idea of a leader seems like a centralized component do you feel that there's this
 tension between having a leader and and wanting to decentralize everything facilitate are there people that do things and they could do it in a pure basis they could do it in a facility facilitative bases in a leadership basis is the leader more collaborative or is the leader more dictatorial so leaders themselves are not anathema I would say and I one of the great things about the start of the kryptos citizens sensibility is rethinking relationships with authority in every venue and including economics then politics and so if ya so so we would be the crypto status and Sensibility examine leaders to be displaying and qualities that are more facilitative and collaborate
 I rather than dictatorial and I think the talocan and nearly everybody in the cryptocurrency movement or having it analyzed necessarily but the general is superior culture is one of collaboration
 your book is called blockchain blueprint for a new economy I love the ambitious promise of the title so let's talk about some of the applications of the blockchain and will begin with the straightforward domain which is finance and will get progressively more interesting what are old and major financial institutions adopting the blockchain yes everybody it's for legal and illegal purposes or a professional institutional corporate government users and for entrepreneurial users it's really for everyone and so blockchain applications are number one it's a better better course it's a better way to remake our existing world where in some of the biggest applications in Banking and Financial Services are that any any kind of transfer has been taken
 three days and that's true for Securities trading settlement and that's true for Bank transfers and why in this day and age that would it need to take 3 days to transfer a digital asset on a ledger and so number one blockchain applications are a better horse they improve the way we do things now but the big the big promise is it black chains are also a car and it which is a revolutionary new way of doing things and it's really a moment and getting us to a larger scale form of computational infrastructure to really get into the big data that your hot springs ample with million-person genome file Health Data common or immediate worldwide cash transfers or communities that are a global and local at the same time and so with the car we don't even know what the potential future applications can be but blockchain technology is extensible for not just rebuilding our world better but for making
 the New World 2
 I spent some time in finance and some of it was difficult for me as I felt that there was a
 mistaken Assumption of this efficient market hypothesis thing where
 you can't make new value in the world you know the amount of value in the world is fixed based on like thermodynamic laws or something and so I'm curious in your experiences in your discussions do the major financial institutions understand that
 if you had if you make a core fundamental invention breakthrough like blockchain is more value appears in the world or is the way that they look at it just value is disappearing from our coffers and going towards some blockchain institution it like how did they see it they both of you is either of the pie is fixed and we're fighting over it or the pie keeps growing and so some some people really get it like flies Masters formally at JP Morgan and now leading a digital asset group understand the pie is bigger frame and and many Executives in banking and finance I think understand they are very much motivated by the fear of our pie is shrinking and how do we what do we need how do we need to move to get out of that and so we need to start looking up blockchain technology as even it just the next new software are you don't need to buy
 do any of the etiology of blockchain it's really just an improved software play
 I see so there is it doesn't sound like there's any like total zero some Auntie Bitcoin strategically because there's no real route to implement a strategy yeah yeah so I guess they must conservative position would be you know we really need to say that any new software technology proven before we start to implement it maybe we are some outsources and they take out Sorcerers in r value chain and they take some of the blockchain technology risk but there is yeah there's really what there can be conservative inflammation implementations as well that are are still an exploratory stance towards walk Chainz Yeah talk about the blockchain applications to Commerce such as openbazaar interesting is that the blockchain ecosystem is evolve
 quite specifically into different sectors different industry sectors and in the case of of exchange or decentralized marketplaces there are a couple of known examples openbazaar and didn't market and these are essentially the Craigslist a decentralized version of Craigslist and so any Community could Implement an application like and then exchange application like openbazaar and that could be for hospital equipment inventory in our city for example or a could be for and distributed fresh food in hydroponic farming Community or any kinds of local communities that might be wanting a decentralized exchange and also accompanied by a community token for how we actually run the economy in our community
 how are older Commerce institutions adopting the blockchain not sure what you mean by all devices like Amazon or Walmart has lot of their website where retailers like Overstock and Newegg software where some of the first to announce the acceptance of Bitcoin so Bitcoin has you can use it in in physical locations in in in real life and you can also use it for purchasing economic transactions on the web many vendors have have moved to this also what's nice it is if you are a vendor it's much cheaper to accept Bitcoin then to accept credit cards you that 3% transaction fee goes away and bitpay is the merchant Bitcoin transaction provider they have a well over 50%
 the market there are gold standard so if you are a vendor is very easy to accept Bitcoin and you would convert it on a daily basis so there is very limited exchange rate risk but it's actually quite easy to accept Bitcoin if you are a vendor and many vendors is just I would be just like accepting PayPal or another credit card form of kind of form of payment very easy conceptually to build new file storage and communication applications child project here is called storage sto RJ and made safe is another project and so the DD the issue is exactly as you mentioned earlier you refer to blockchain bloat which is already just the transaction volume makes for Big Block Chain and we can't possibly store related data in the blockchain transaction so there is one
 Kodak a comment code field in the blockchain transaction is called op underscore return and it says believe 80 character field so that's enough to stick it in another cryptographic hash of a digital asset confirmation for example but or any other kind of commenting but that's definitely not where you would want to store a whole Jean traffic or an EMR or any kind of thing and so is it in the watching ecosystem we would have secured blockchain records that record data and give the pointer to off change secured decentralized storage and so I can register my Gino file on the blockchain with a pointer to is off chain location via storage or made say and then when I join a project like DNA bits and I contribute my genome to this Health Data common then I provide them with Mikey the private Key by which they can access my off day
 find stored data and so in the overall blockchains are just one piece of the new decentralized safe crypto architecture to say that that sort of like using a URL shortener on on Twitter to compress a message into 140 characters action right interesting so let's go back into engineering just a bit let's say you wanted to build a voice over IP application on the blockchain what would that even mean like I lost l o s t e l. Co and is basically a decentralized version decentralized secure version of Skype and so some governments I'll listen in to Skype and Austell
 so is exactly the the blockchain decentralized secure alternative to that and of course it makes sense to to have a secure of the old VoIP service and show how would like if an application if I ever wanted to do that just for my engineering perspective how would he go about that or is he or she so when you go to to get repost for Bitcoin and look for and the forums and look for the different kinds of parameters already existing and software projects to do to do the new project and so their number of Bitcoin related Wiki he's and forums and stack exchange discussion areas and then similarly also for aetherium so the point I didn't make about etherium previously is that a theorem is really like a blockchain 2.0 is for smart contracts its for very sophisticated kinds of
 as opposed to all of the Bitcoin cryptocurrencies are mutt are for much more straightforward currency transfers it's a one-time a spot transaction a one-time transaction as opposed to a constellation of events happening in the future like for example alone so if you want to do a peer-to-peer decentralize loan you Jesus theory on if you want to just do it by a Coffee Transit cash transaction you use Bitcoin and in the case of aetherium there's either. Fund which is a developer portal with a number of code examples in human presented work.
 right so I essentially what you're saying is if you want to build a application on bitcoin blockchain the technology is there the developer resources are there in Courage people to go and try to spend the remainder of this discussion talking about the more ambitious higher-level implications of blockchain Technology would you write about a lot of the blockchain change government and introduce an interesting case in point is June legislation in Vermont to look at blockchain public records repositories so the idea with one or functionality of blockchains is the hashing the past capability by which I mean the ability to time date stamp the contents of a digital file at a certain
 time and so if you want to provide proof of existence of say you're a particular document like a will or a contract or software code base or digital artwork what you can do is run a hashing algorithm over it and that open no matter how large the file size could be a Gino file and what will pop out at the end is a hash a 32 or so character code that corresponds the exact contents of that file at that time and then with that hat in the memo field you can do a blockchain transaction and which will be timestamp so that confirms that file's contents at a very specific time and date and then later it's not at all that the world can access that file but the but the hash of that file is double-click sociable and then what happens in 50 years when you need to proof of existence your will for example the same hashing algorithm is run over the phone
 and if the file has not changed then the same hash will be generated and so this is really the way that we can move all of a society's public records repository into a blockchain format so that's the first and most important way of black Chainz and future governance that all documents might be handled via blockchain and that could be title registrations for houses and autos for Property Transfers and registrations for marriage licenses for death certificates for business registration for all manner of public documents that need to be recorded how deep you are thinking is there's a SlideShare called blockchain health and crypto Wellness Futures what is at the intersection of health and the blockchain
 Tumi blockchain technology is a way we got to truly this next node in global scale Computing lot chains are a general computational substrate and they really get us into the big data at your we've had centralized model Google's ten million servers that continuously crawl the web or what we think of is Big Computing now but that's tiny compared to what blockchains can do and the first application area for really big data is hell and that includes emrs having a universal structure worldwide for how we preserve electronic medical records Reserve an access and then also all of that help the data research that we need to do with a full whole Human Genome filed and that alone the microbiome help human health history all of these big data health streams can't be really evaluated or thousands of people in a centralized format and soul
 need to do that in a decentralized model and blocked hands are finally a way that we can do these Health Data research, and then I also think of some of the more exciting exotic properties of blockchains like Demerol you asked about dinner Mirage currencies and Hemorrhage currency is a currency that's redistributable and so what that means is that we could Implement General guaranteed basic income initiatives with a blockchain cryptocoin and that could provide the sustainability allowance in abundance economies as that's a guaranteed basic income initiative but also did Mirage currency so Denver College currency is a redistributable currency so why don't we start to think of other resources as currencies like and do redistribution with them over example of the human brain the way that new ideas happen and coordinator
 function in general is through long-term potentiation and so this is synapses signaling to each other and cognitive enhancement drugs like still tough are specifically targeted at stimulating long-term potentiation and so what if we thought about potentiation as a redistributable or Demerol currency in the brain and we started using principles were learning from blockchain in the way we manage other situations like like facilitating ideas that we have in our brain and also and this is relative to human brains that also has broke building artificial intelligence machine intelligence how we might have the creativity and Innovation possibilities that we have with human brain how we might stimulate that in a Computing Network in an artificial intelligence kind of way and I suggest that we can draw upon blotching principle. To do that as well
 so I really love the Christmas that you have to find all these different ideas so what are the things are what is basic income do you believe that basic income is a necessity for us to have a functioning economy going forward moving to in the in the future I'm not necessarily in the subsidy by the idea that it is. Who's time is starting to come and so this is the idea of just supplying the basic we're so rich as economies and especially with the automation economy that we are starting to get to a point in different countries that different time but we're starting to get to the point where we have the resources available to pay every citizen every person monthly week or weekly allowance to cover basic sustainability basic food and shelter and what would it mean if all of us
 economics became something of abundance and not scarcity where everybody's minimal needs were met and then selecting different kinds of work or productive activity could be on the basis not of necessity but on on the basis of interested willing participation and this to me is is part of an overall shift from scarcity to this is what I really want a mind shift from scarcity to abundance me it means there's a blanket of needs nut so that higher level human Endeavors can be focused on
 so that's awesome so let's we could spend so much time on that and if readers want to know more about some of the stuff behind what Melanie is talking about I suggest checking out some of the stuff by Martyn Ford or by Tyler Cowen or Ray Kurzweil if you're feeling more optimistic so how would you define the singularity number to things to people that generally mean by the technological singularity is a moment when computational intelligence exceeds human intelligence however I think I'm more helpful frame and you just mentioned Tyler Cohen and some of these other authors of Luciano floridi is a philosopher of information at Oxford what a number of these analyst Economist and philosophers have been pointing out is that already it's not a case of humans versus machine already human humans and machines are in
 cerebral interaction in collaboration and so already we interact a person interacts more with technological entities than with other human and the best agent for the job is the computer doing 95% of the routine tasks and a human doing the 5% of the Innovation or exception to ask and so we're already in a world that where were inextricably collaborating with machine and so to me blockchains and other benefit of blockchains is that there was structure where we can preserve the safety and integrity of different kinds of Agents meaning human and machine agent so that machine agents don't take over humans but humans retain integrity and identity in an overall system of collaboration with checks and balances and trust and security and this is another benefit of blockchains being that the format or longer-term human machine collaboration
 that's why I think weather thinking has already gone but not Beyond The Singularity to a reframe of how can we humans and machines work together and positive collaboration out of positive and safe collaborative environment
 would you say that the blockchain is potentially a solution to the artificial intelligence problems raised by Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking and I have a whole chunk of work on how blockchains can be used to enact a friendly AI because we didn't realize we always thought we'd have super intelligent computers but we didn't we didn't really consider the world which is one of spark networks we're all of relevant and important transactions occur on network we want to access resources information conduct transactions go about our business and he agent wants to go about their business and to do that it will be in a digital smart Network environment and to do conduct transactions they will need to be validated and confirmed and some sort of consensus mechanism and that is where and to have your you need to be a Bonafide good agent with a reputation and good
 rotational standing to have your network transactions confirmed validated and executed and so this is how friendly I can be enacted that even in a guy that would like to be militias has to behave as a friendly agent to accomplish even the most basic of network operation and so blockchains are away of enforcing good player behavior and that's something we already see for example in the mining operation that and that in the bigger question of secure distributed network computing more generally as how to do we evoke at Ruth State on a world which is based based on good player Behavior
 you spend a lot of time thinking about the future I'd like to you to give me the most ambitious yet believable extrapolation of the present to the Future that you have imagined or like we were in space stations are what does it look like to you but I think I'm one of the topics I work on as a technology philosopher is personal identity and I think that we are as humans we're sort of overly attached to the notion of personal identity we are right now we're packaged in this form of his physical body but that could be an Eeveelution area convenience and I think when we look at the future every everything seems to expand there are more ways to do things their bring sample records didn't ruin the radio industry it actually expanded the music appreciation and now we have
 Cloud sound and all kinds of different modes of of of participating in music generation and listening similarly with intelligent and so I one of my future visions that we is that we start to have more and more digital copies of ourselves running on blockchains or other digital environment and already you could compute from a with a deep learning algorithm some sort of reasonable Fidelity for a current current person or per person from their web imprint in the case of lots of people and so I think that identity becomes malleable and I think that and it becomes multiple and so we become less and less wedded to this person Hall this this for physical form the
 we have found ourselves in so I see identity multiplicity as a future Thing 1 current paper I've been working in on is in a blockchain using blockchain as a safe way to participate in a cloud mind collaboration so what we really wanting is mentally to collaborate in a bigger fashion and make solve problems make contribute arrive at new ideas beyond that which we might be able to do in our own mind alone and what if we could do human machine blockchain cloudmine participations in a Safeway so this that's a flavor of some of the more esoteric or for far-reaching things I'm thinking about
 what is the institute for blockchain Studies Institute for blockchain studies is a nonprofit research startup that I found it last year specifically to look at the impact of the blockchain technology on society
 great so I'd like to see how back of it and if if somebody in the audience is a somebody that is looking at the things that you just Define the cloud mind sort of collaborative almost like post religious philosophy and is looking and this this person is looking at the current state of Technology looking at aetherium and blockchain and Bitcoin what are some ways that that person can help to work towards the future that you defined so positively and so eloquently. Code start making an application for any area of relevance and interest to individual people like for example okay well you know I have a sick gram
 mother and I want to have a blockchain smart contract Advocate to to take care of her legal advocacy on her behalf in a health situation and so that's something that can already be done now right now smart smart contract a I advocate for for somebody with a bin AB watching and so they're there right now is the time to start developing these applications and it's already possible to do so and do you have any advice for people that are working on their career right now so it's it's it strikes me that you seem to be in a position that you're you're pretty happy with the work that you're doing your career has been really interesting maybe you've enjoyed it all the way through but there's there's been all sorts of different things in your past do you have any suggestions for how people can navigate there
 career from between different Waters where they may have varying degrees of satisfaction in their job and that includes making an investment and less satisfaction less satisfactory area perhaps do it to get the learning or the benefit or the right of that yeah I think my recommendation would be just just get into very close touch with purpose like what's your purpose for doing anyone on thing and to be quite clear with yourself that okay it's it's good as filling these knees is not to feeling these other needs I'm going to do this for a time frame I'm going to try to explore other things so I think it's staying on touch with purpose is useful and then being willing to to leave situations that don't work and really be extremely enterprising and in creating a realizing what I've actually
 realize is I don't usually find I don't usually run across a happy career situations for myself presented in the world and so I have to create them and so it's just a matter of having the taking the responsibility to create situations that do work for me and I expect that could be true at of innovators and entrepreneurs and so just a willingness to Define what you want and try to create it was fantastic thank you for coming on software engineering daily it's been a real pleasure talking to you you really fantastic at the you know just articulating the both the low-level aspects of Bitcoin and blockchain and all the related Technologies as well as the most ambitious societal implications of this technology and and end in doing that you've really

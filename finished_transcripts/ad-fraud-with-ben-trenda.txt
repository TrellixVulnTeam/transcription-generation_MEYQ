Transcription: advertising fraud takes billions of dollars out of the economy every year we don't know exactly how much money is being lost because we don't know what percentage of Internet users are Bots and we don't know how those Bots are interacting in order to extract money from the advertising ecosystem are you a human is a company designed to solve this problem and provides a service for verifying whether a user is real or automated Ben trenda is the CEO of are you a human in this episode we discuss some of the ways that boat's poses humans clicking on ads pretending to read ads defrauding marketers and Publishers and we also talked about how are you a human combats this this episode is part of a series of episodes about advertising fraud and if you know anything about this area or you have a recommendation for somebody to interview send me an email Jeff at software engineering daily.com but that I hope you like this episode

Ben trenda is the CEO of are you a human than welcome to stop engineering daily rod and other types of Fraud and to illustrate the idea of what add Fridays I didn't really know about it until a few years ago when a friend of mine told me the story and she told me this meeting that she was and we're basically add fraud was displayed in graphical form she was in a meeting she worked at a company we're basically this company was a middleman in the ad industry you know there's tons of little man in ad tech companies and there was this graph that was in one of the slide and the graphics they showed a trend that was up and to the right and and she's like looking at the graph she's like what this there's no way this is right and she raised her hand she asked questions
and she's like so does this graph is this graph saying that the the trend from the trend of our bot traffic the ads that we are displaying that are getting shown to bots has Trend it up to 80% and 80% of the ads that we are displaying two people are getting shown to Botts and when she asks this question the CEO who is in a meeting says you need to shush right now and ever since she told me that story I have been trying to understand what is this ad for all that stuff is because it I get the sense that there is this big ad tech industry and there's a bunch of don't ask don't tell about add frauded so at you as a reporter it's turned out to be a very difficult subject to report on so is that perception is my perception correct is there a lot of add fraud and is this a big don't ask don't tell in the ad tech industry
citizenship question there is in fact a lot of that fraud I don't know 80% is egregious 80% is possible but I think what he's taking me to reasonable steps to prevent it should should have a lower percentage like let's call it 20 to 30% fraud and I don't know that it's a hotel might be a little too official I think what's really going on it's that you have a number of the basically every player in the ecosystem has a set of incentives that don't align well with solving a problem like a fraud for example you have the ad tech companies who are primarily trying to get it delivered some kind of a service to their client maybe try to create some kind of performance on the back end
you have the sellers they don't necessarily want to admit that they have you know bots on their site fraud for say some of this non-human traffic is created for other reasons their thoughts that scrape content off of websites that are Bots that post comments erroneously you have a hundred and seventy-five million fake Facebook profiles these spots don't exist to defraud the ad system but they do have they do it differently consume a lot of ads so far is at Broad and there is also a lot of other waste but I don't know if it ate an 80% feels a little egregious how would you define the term at fraud
a good question show my point of view on this is that fraud connotes intentionality so there's a there are a lot of forms of fraud that you could call fraud within that definition you have things like people who will generate Bots that will go and could see him at Impressions maybe click on ads maybe even surf around and advertisers website to pick up retargeting pixel those things are actual fraud then you have inadvertently
waste which is often referred to as fraud by our industry and ends up in the same percentages but those would be Bots that are designed to crawl the internet maybe scrape pricing information number of other things that are inadvertently consuming ads but aren't intentionally consuming apps
 so you have been in the ad Tech business for more than a decade can you explain how add fraud has developed in that time how have you seen the rise of AD fraud or and how have you gotten a sense for what percentage of the marketplace is fraudulent sure so there's two questions there all take me to order interesting we add fraud has been around since the beginning earlier my career I was part of the early team at a company called Overture originally called goto.com we were the precursor to Google search so it was the ability to pay to post your link in the search results
 and you pay on a cost-per-click basis Google later copy that business model that was Rife with fraud from the very beginning it wasn't all if it wasn't fraud that was perpetrated so that the perpetrator could realize financial gain from the clicks instead in that case it was to drive down the performance of their competitors to deflate the value of the the auction the pricing within the keyword marketplaces and Overture than later Yahoo app required and then later Google all built significant amounts of technology and even human teams to try to weed out this Friday and that's been an ongoing battle that continues to this day and this is Sierra Sue 15 or 16 years later this problem continues I don't actually think that ad fraud has gotten worse I think that the
 Ernest Tubb it has gotten more acute and that's a big part of it so on your site you say that 58% of traffic on the Internet is generated by Bots how did you get that number how can you differentiate between bot traffic in human traffic
 great questions that stat is has been widely reported it's not ours and you can you seen a report in Wall Street Journal Financial Times New York Times at age at exchanger it's at but we do seem very similar levels of vied activity across our own aren't Footprints so we measure about 3 million sites the way that our technology works is we cook code out there will measure the biometric activity of the users meeting how did they behave what do they do with their mouse or cursor there scroll their accelerometer if they're on a mobile device couple hundred of these inputs we analyzed that users Behavior compared with the hundreds or hundreds of millions depending on the site real human users who have been on those pages and then importantly we watch that user leaves that site and then goes to other sites on the internet
 how does their behavior change how does everything about their browser configuration Hardware software and behavior how does that all changed over time it's we can be very sure that you're human and we see it fairly consistent level of humanness overtime and we see it fairly consistent level of non human activity over time as well so 58% is seems directionally accurate based on our numbers but then within the context of advertising the real numbers probably a little bit lower there's a lot of non human activity that doesn't make its way it's you advertising fraud a fraudster what I would do is I would set up a click Farm in India or something in Pakistan and I would get 200 people in a room and I would have them navigate through the internet and do
 various things and I would record their behavior and I would train a machine learning model to average out what they're doing and I would replicate their environments that they're working on which is easy to do through virtualization technology and basically I would just duplicate the behavior that they are engaging in and I would continue to record their behavior over time to update the model and how that biometrically changes over time and then you could also just expand the sample size of people your your Gathering data from by doing something where you have malware and it's recording the other behavior of real users how how would you verify that type of or how would you prevent that type of bought behavior from from from getting by you you had a great question so what you described as
 what is the most sophisticated and least-used forms of fraud now we have a number of ways that we try to address that particular use case but note be before we get into that that that's a a small percentage rate that the vast majority are dumb Bots meeting very easy to catch and then you've got more sophisticated fraud or box that are going through to two links to avoid detection because they have some kind of Nefarious purpose at the end and it may not be at Friday might be account hacking or comment spam or retail price scraping one of the hardest thing for a bot developer to do is to know what we're looking for on every one of three million sites right and then
 user Behavior spanning sites right there so you can do replay attack those are rare and we normally will catch those by kind of all of the other Ensemble and methodologies that we have a meeting everything about Hardware software it's hiding devices together a Time devices across pot-nets together looking at activity as it moves from one site to another to another and then of course it's it's theoretically possible but highly improbable that somebody would have a good model for what for the actual biometric activity of a given user on every one of three million websites and then that that user would introduce variability into their behavior as they go from one side to another site and then back to the original site because we're humans don't do exactly the same thing when every page so it's
 Michael E but it is it is possible to 58% number through through your basic measures you could cut that down quite a bit and then you could cut it almost all the way to Sero with more sophisticated measures and then I think to knock out that very last little bit we're going to continue to have to stay in front of the the fraudsters and continue to evolve this point we feel like we have the ability to catch a hundred percent of it it will only get more sophisticated from this point on
 you should understand is how do you know that your stats on what percentage of the bot traffic is correct if these people who are replicating cut replication attack or something record what is it replay attack replay attack effective how do you know that you're catching them yeah good question so it back right so
 people don't create Bots to perpetrate fraud unless there's an economic reason for them to do it and the vast majority of websites and advertisers and AD tech companies are only taking pre modest approaches to solving that so the type of attack that you described is highly sophisticated and actually would cost a lot of money right to to to capture the kind of behaviors that you would need and then go through the process of building the models and keeping the models of today in order to do a replay fat attacks that that's the first part of the answer so there's no real economic incentive yet for somebody to do that maybe if you got into like the hacking of large bank accounts but certainly not you know stealing fractions of a penny to be served an ad because you can make so much money with just basic bought maneuver
 the second part of the answer though is
 that you let me see how to frame this for second machine learning problem the biggest thing that the hardest thing is coming up with good bass data data that you can train on right so they're there are number of techniques for this and we've got places where we actually have code in in places where we know for sure that these are human we have actual humans that were training on we have 16000 sites that have deployed more in-depth form of code that we use to replace captcha and so we can be a hundred percent sure that those these arguments that we have you can you compare to like a Nielsen Oregon score panel of users that you can build you know very robust training sets against and so we feel highly car
 that we're able to catch those replay attacks because we know what real human behavior is
 I'd I just don't understand because to me it seems like so you mentioned it the cause the first of all the cost is sitting at setting up this replay attack infrastructure be expensive to me it doesn't sound that sounds like a fixed cost you get your 250 people in a room or you have some some piece of malware that's on a bunch of people's Windows machine somewhere recording their behaviors and that's that's not expensive to buy to fix cost and once you get the Flywheel spinning like if you got a way to defraud Facebook particularly particular do you defrost your Facebook ads you figure out a scheme there then you could just kill that up and and and keep that flywheel Spanish I understand why it's why they would be expensive not really because the internet is evolving constantly right so if you want to go to cnn.com and mimic real human behavior you'd have to
 that model up-to-date every day and throughout the day because real human behavior changes as the website changes right so it's very difficult compared with the you know literally billions of dollars that you can make true much more simple. Maneuvering okay so basically the ideas that the there's not enough fraud Talent on the Internet or there's like 4 because if people are just ate it sounds like we're saying he's like well the yes it is possible to do this but there's not enough sophisticated people who are defrauding ad networks because it's too complicated these people would have their time better spent doing bank fraud or something like that
 sure but why wouldn't yeah right I mean if you look at the levels hacking on the internet and there are much higher value targets then the fraction of a sent you get for defrauding the ad system and those are high quality problems for sure and they're reporting to solve in and we think that are approaches part of the robot solution that the that the entire internet need somebody to take a quick step back right all of the existing fraud detection services that all of them all of them and that goes for all of the companies that are trying to dress add fraud as well as the fraud detection measures that are built into CD ends and Standalone security firms are based on this idea that you can go out and catch Bots by looking for Bots problem with that idea
 actually let me use an analogy when they train federal agents in Bank employees to spot counterfeit money they don't actually train on counterfeit because every time that there's a counterfeit it's different in some way than the last time right so if you're out looking for the counterfeit so you're out looking for the bot you're going to miss a lot of them contrast that with how you would solve a problem like border security right border security if you were to start border security program for lets a new nation you probably wouldn't start by trying to create a list of everyone in the world she's not allowed in your country Norwood you try to just put up TSA agents to look for people who look like the bad guys right you would instead issue passports and so we can tell over a long period of time that a user is definitely human because we're we're taking that same approach right we identify the next time we see them we we are verifying
 next time you see them we verify that you're still human and showing after a while you have such a high degree of certainty that that users Acumen if it when they are too to be infected by now where we can start to see their behavior change and their profile change in ways that do not match their previous Behavior so you know that. That is the complete solution that you need for every form of fraud on the internet but I would say that is like the fundamental building block that didn't exist before we started this the same way that you would not be able to have a complete border security program without a passport one piece okay so you're describing are you human your technology why you just described that in a little more detail what what does are you a human do
 yeah sure so I started to touch my pieces and if so I'll try to make it in a really fast and not return it from what we've already talked about we took this approach that again there are lots of fraud company is devoted to finding Bots we felt like you needed a strong signal about which users were actually human has part of that larger solution so we set out to do just that and basically our our product works like this week gift code to web sites and other companies that serve Kodi users around about 3 million websites today including big lunch Yahoo AOL Etc and if we see you this morning on Yahoo finance everything about your Hardware or software your browser configuration and how has that changed since the last time we saw you and then we're looking at the Biometrics as I mentioned sort of a couple hundred different data points
 stop what you're doing after consuming this content and then we're looking at how that changes over time and how that compares with the hundreds of millions of other known humans that we have seen on this page of Yahoo finance recently and how do those users change over time everything from your Hardware or software and the way that you behave etcetera and then you know what we do is we we kind of maintain profiles on the issues there's an Emirate talking about anything that would cause you to have privacy concerns and we're not looking at urine test and scored website should your visiting other than to help confirm that you're human and then we license and information to websites and when we pass it back to the website to the website to know before they serve Continental Air pricing or ads or login screen or whatever issues you're definitely human or are they definitely bought or are they some
 degree of human were bought in between we might not know for sure we might say you know this user is 80% and depending on what it is that you want to serve them you may have different threshold levels for how confident you want to feel I'm talking about you know that you might want to be a hundred percent confident or if you're not a hundred percent confident that maybe you give them two-factor authentication or something that's not up to us that's up to the client that the place is technology we simply provide a very strong very accurate signal very fast and very inexpensively and then let people decide what they want to do with that information now a company like an AOL or Yahoo so they would want a higher degree of humanity from the users that are browsing a page because they want to have good stats for the ads that they are selling they want to be able to sell ad space and
 look you know advertisers have an average of this many clicks when they come to their website or you don't have to live this frequency of of acquisition of people actually clicking through and and purchasing products or or something like that is that accurate because that's the business that they're in so you think about what's happening on the publisher sided of just the internet at large it's the more and more websites that are out there the more audience consumption becomes fragmented the more difficult it is for these websites to have large audiences and at the same time you have for a variety of reasons including just proliferation of websites proliferation to page views but also low-quality sites and non human activity that are creating a thug let of Supply such that
 prices are dropping so you have a declining reader shed or Saget readership combined with stagnant or declining prices you not have a problem and we seen that echoed throughout the industry in in the unit you hit print first and now it's sitting in a major premium website so as those sites try to do things to to gain new audiences they also have the same problem that their advertisers have which are if I'm going to go spend money to do traffic acquisition how do I ensure that that's a hundred percent unit so we're providing them it's cool to help him solve that problem
 Apache Kafka is a modern message broker and it provides the messaging backbone for building a new generation of distribute applications you can listen to a podcast I did with her roku's engineering team about Kafka and how the team at Heroku built and is using Apache Kafka as a service using Kafka on Heroku can save your team hours of tuning and configuration and maintenance work provisioning and operating Apache Kafka is often a challenge so check out Apache Kafka on Heroku you can get a great introduction to that product by listening to the episode I did with Tom crayford of Heroku Kafka I did it on October 25th 2016 so you should check it out thanks to Heroku for being a sponsor software engineering daily I don't do episodes for every sponsor I am very particular about the shows that I do and Heroku
 is a service that I've used many times in the past so I am happy to do a show about the architecture of a key building block of a service that I use on a regular basis thanks again to a Roku for being a sponsor software Gene Kelly
 there have been a few pieces about add fraud from people like Samuel Scott Bob Hoffman talks a lot about add fraud there's also this awesome video I don't know if you saw on YouTube while ago by guy named veritasium is about like getting fake likes on on Facebook and it wasn't specifically about add fraud but it's basically about the degree to which fraud is automated and intelligent but aside from these guys like veritasium in Tamil Scott and Bob Hoffman there is just get the says there's not a lot of people that are talking about ad from talking about like it in real specifics
 why haven't there been more whistleblowers in the industry will I think the first part is it's not like the companies themselves the ad tech companies with Publishers are perpetrating the fraud I mean 99.9% of them want to solve the problem just as much as anyone else so it's hard to sort of blow a whistle when it's not your employer who was causing the following sentence to solve the problem because it's not the easiest problem solved so everyone from the the the publisher who now owns an audience that they want to monetize the attic companies in the middle or simply just trying to process transactions and take their cut the ad agencies who are already overworked and under guns there's more at
 companies that they have to evaluate this year than they were last year and that's been the case for the last 10 years the last thing anybody wants to do is waste time trying to solve a problem that they don't truly understand so they just want the pain to go away in the way that they've made the problem go away is by they pay a small fee to their skin or double verify her in her glad science remote for a couple others and they say okay my job here is done they don't really dig in and find out that those companies are really just doing the bare minimum of protection because now they've got the ability to say what we solve the problem where we've done something here so you know our hands are clean and and really it's really just the brand since you have an incentive to solve the problem and for the most part they don't really know how big of a problem is by brand you mean companies are purchasing ads right. They don't know
 what should I be five steps back from the actual transaction American Airlines aircraft or Coca-Cola these buyers don't know the degree to which fraud pervades the advertising ecosystem that's correct but that is also not the easiest problem solved because nobody really wants to hear that they have a big problem right that's see that's what makes it even more perversity is that even the CMOS at Coca-Cola or craft or whatever they don't want to hear like hey the ads your mind on the site are you know maybe these are going to be viewed by Bots more likely all they want to know is like hey are these ads cheaper is my impression at least sure I mean that's a big part of it they have goals around CPN
 and I'm in a pretty simplistic goals the latest the latest gold is your is the ability and video completion rates which are ironically if you set a goal of having a hundred percent utility or hundred percent video completion rate you will almost certainly have more Bots and non-human traffic then you had then you would have if you set different goals but but that information disseminate slowly and and those people also have you know jobs in bosses and they want to get home at the end of the day so the last thing they necessarily want is for somebody to tell them that they have a problem that you don't really feel like they have and their agency is telling them they don't we have a problem their vendors are telling they don't really have a problem and its 5 and I want to get home to my family
 yeah and you know you mentioned incentives like when I think about the incentives of Google and Facebook who are the advertising behemoths in the room to build a realize these are at companies it seems like there is very little incentive to remove fraud all together because Facebook in Google together they have a duopoly on Broad Internet advertising and the fact is at advertising does work everything actually does work we would be having this conversation otherwise that's why the industry is so big it does work to some degree but if you are a marketer your dollar does not go as far in a market with fraud as it would go in a market without fraud so perversely Google and Facebook are incentivized to keep some amount of fraud in the ecosystem so that at until that marketers have to spend
 more dollars right no I don't think so they have an incentive to get rid of Fraud and they are trying everything they can and I would say that you know Google is done a very good job we know that they're still fraud in Google's market place we see it but if they've definitely done a better job than most of the big players okay how can how can we know like what percentage of advertising campaigns run on Google or Facebook do you think are I don't know what are the ways what is Sophie if I'm an Advertiser on a Google or Facebook what are the ways that I can know that my ads are being viewed by by Clean traffic
 it's it's very hard right you have to work with a company who specializes in this and then you have to you know trust their numbers or you can you know where you can use more than one and see if you can get consensus between the to show why I mean how do we how do we know that the Google and Facebook are do or how do we know to what degree Google and Facebook are are doing doing everything they can to you no half measures against advertising fraud I mean why I like how it how can we know how accountable this stuff is if you doing I mean they were still in this isn't my stat that you can Google this there's a hundred and seventy-five million fake Facebook profiles that are being driven by bots so
 we know this but we know that both companies are you putting some resources against it the other the other piece is at the end of the day if you look at the performance not how many people clicked because boss will click it Bots will watch her at all the way to the end and Surfer on your website but if you're selling a product you know how many people actually paid for the product and when you did and when you employed a new solution to prevent fraud did you see lift in the metrics that you really care about so if you're tracking things correctly should sue one example for that is I just gave you earlier how we maintain kind of profiles on users that are in a verified human overtime and some of our customers will take that list of verified humans and they they've got you know variety of different targeting parameters for giving campaign but
 add dirt bike human as the final filter so they'll say you know I just want a hundred percent humans who are also fit all of my other car charging criteria and just saw all the card so they can combine these things on on their own and then they don't tell us self-reported but fairly consistently that they see it 25% left in post click activity so you don't do we know for sure no but if you choose 25 users that we definitely are performing 25% better than users that the major fraud detection companies say are not by then you got to think okay there is some qualitative difference here in on you because you signed up and you have an account there same with Google and they've got some first-hand data and they're also watching your browsing activity off Network meaning
 if you're using if you're using let's say Facebook to log into other websites than Facebook is tracking what you're doing on this website says well mostly for the most part their profiles exist for Advertiser targeting our profile exists only to tell you one thing is this user definitely human or not and so all any data that we have just simply supports that Stat one yusuke so it's not valuable is what you're trying to do is figure out which of these in billions of Internet users wants to buy a car next month but it is valuable if you want to know if they're getting more detail so this I imagine you know you were talking about how the the way that people use the internet changes over time and this is why the replay attack thing is susceptible would have to be a very sophisticated infrastructure of
 recording human behavior in building machine learning model off of that but on the on the defense side the machine learning pipeline probably looks kind of similar cuz you're trying to learn what a human looks like so that you can identify it and show it on the replay attack side they're trying to learn what a human looks like so that they can replicate that behavior how does that machine learning pipeline look from your side when what kind what is your infrastructure look like in terms of building that machine learning out what we will use it on a Bible methodology in and I know that your your separately interviewing Tyler are founders CTO and I said yeah probably do a much better job of of going into detail there but what I can tell you is we don't use anyone approach we use an ensemble of methodologies including deep learning and we We Believe
 that is the combination of those that is the combination is stronger than any one of the techniques individually okay so I understand you are you human Technologies useful not just for doing add fraud doing at unit verification that there's a human viewing an ad but also for other methods of fraud like you know you can you can add some Brazilian stew banking systems perhaps or transaction systems keep can you talk more about how that works sure so a fact we've got some large companies out there to play this technology Fort for those sorts of these cases as well retail transaction fraud bank account hacking etcetera on in terms of our product it works the same way we're developing a profile on a user over time regardless of use queso
 I've been on probably 10 websites today and I'm going to guess the majority that is four sites that were measuring so that's just continually updating my profile yes then is human right now it's so if I were to go to a bank that was using this technology as that page is loading that thang what would either call through our API or we would have Precinct this information that you would know as that page is the bank would know I see Pages loading that I am definitely human right now and still human right now and then they can have rule set up that say go ahead and give him the standard simple login if there's any doubt and I may be my behavior has changed slightly today or maybe things were happening last night when I was asleep in the score drops a little bit they may say okay let's do two Factor authentication today
 it's a verb any other use gets really what we do is we would either you know how's that and customer ping us through an API or pre synchronize those user so that they know in advance as that page is loading and then they can make the decisions on their side about what you skips they want to consult a to you compared are you human to some other bot detection or human traffic filtering Technologies where that did Center used by companies basically more to pass the buck then add to actually try to detect bought can you describe what those other bot detection bot versus humidity action software pieces are using and how that compares are you a human
 there's two there's two groups there are those companies outside of the Attica system and then there's the D advertising fraud companies are called add verification companies in desert like double verifying his last night's mode right off the cetera started before your other forms of add fraud it's still exist today where you might stuff one add inside of another load things be stacking stuff saying there's no stacking is like where you have an add location on a page and somebody put an ad behind another ad so that other side would never technically be viewed by human eyes
 that is exactly and there's a there's a lot they were a lot of different types of fraud like that work and other types of Brands were constantly worried if they started working with that networks in the for the first time where is my ad actually showing up like how do I know it's not showing up on a porn site or something so they verify that they were getting what they paid for him in traffic which would you really wasn't talking about at all until around 2 years ago there was a there was a big story about Mercedes I think the headline was more Bots more robots than humans saw a Mercedes last video camping and not sent shockwaves through the ecosystem and so the adverb vacation company started to try to play catch-up and and so they learn what they could learn about bought since
 Hartsfield rules the rules based approach you know if the user tries a perfectly straight line with their mouths across the page that's probably about those kinds of things and I'm sure they're you know they've added some machine learning capabilities to that sounds with machine learning always is do you have good ground truth to model on time so we started in a we started with this specific problem in mind over four and a half years ago so we we built it solely for that purpose and you know along the way have made decisions about how to get a beads are most secure and we're also not trying to support all of those see no other East cases like stacking or viewability for example so again we're not saying this is the complete solution for everything
 we're saying this is the part that's the hardest to get right and this is all we do a little more detailed the so if we had the Bots that were doing stuff like moving their mouse in a straight line across the page which no human would do you need to have some kind of trimmer or some kind of like a circular motion is your moving across the page and I remember a so I used to play online poker and the the the most of his kid poker companies would have things in place to detect this type of stuff where if your mouse movement looks really suspicious then they can find wasted to get around that but since then it like that was like 8 or 10 years ago and since then the the bought infrastructure has gotten much more sophisticated to wear these poker companies really can't detect like when there is a bot
 on the system and the the the the behavior. Even the behaviors of it but the problem is like the behaviors of the human have perhaps become more mechanistic and predictable and the behaviors of the bots in the meantime have caught up to the less mechanistic behaviors of a human I still don't understand how so what are the the tricks that you could what are the tactics that really are effective in Catching this kind of really subtle I guess you called it replay attack but it seems like I don't know yeah I guess you play a tax stuff what are the what are the things that really stand out the Biometrics are the first part of it and that's an important piece of information and so so capturing all that capturing it right is is a mouse movement so whatever whatever
 mobile there's a lot of really interesting things like the accelerometer in your cell phone or you know orientation or are you moving when you're you know when you're doing things so there's a couple hundred different types of of those early on in fact we have a patent fully approved on using that type of data for for this problem not that other people wouldn't you know maybe want to do that eventually but we think it's an important piece of a the biggest Jason Hall the hardest things to solve if you wanted to develop a bot that could circumvent the technology like this would be solving the problem of the long-term what we called longitudinal data system if you willing does this user have a reputation of being consist
 the gym in over a long period of time across in a 3 million websites and you and see if you wanted to develop a bot that could have earned a reputation like that would be next to Impossible if you wanted to take malware and try to take over a machine that had a reputation like that you would have to let me know it would be pretty difficult enough to be slightly different than what that users been over a long period of time so I'm not saying that it's not theoretically possible but highly unlikely what is what makes it impossible what's the really hard part about the about
 not in our strategy the strategy where you adopt where you build your own fraudulent longitudinal thing what are the things that are really hard to to do that to do with that officer no no I mean I'm just I'm trying to understand why these boxwood not already exist sure you got a ton of detail just because we don't want to get circumvented or I'm necessarily tell her competitors what we're up to you but that's why we have a name for that so they they take real human behavior in the recall but we think it's pretty pretty hard for users fell for long-term invitation Arc system without being an actual I understand why that's hard white liquid not trying to be like option here I just don't really understand why that's hard cuz like I'm not even in the ad industry into me like I just think of that
 like that what that doesn't seem that hard to do just record some behavior and how do you know what time of day cord what I mean it wouldn't be hard to record a bunch of human behavior like you could Turkish stuff out you could you know if I'm out of it like I said it's all malware and in people's browsers you just just record what people are doing and just and just copy that and I don't see much less often used approach but it is one that we see and yeah I made it it is one of the more sophisticated techniques that we have software
 okay so is that is that I mean are you just like kind of hoping that that is not in wide use because if it were in wide use it wouldn't be possible to catch
 sister from are there any so theoretically possible yes highly unlikely and certainly not the low-hanging fruit that you would want to go after if you were just trying to make a lot of money doing problem
 which is really the point right right now yeah yeah I know I think it's just unsettling you know because it's like when you hear you know him back when I buy play poker it was like if you have a leak in your system in your giveaway that you play the game show map own it is going to figure out how to exploit you and I think it has baked in this black degree of paranoia into my my personality where to stick okay there's this leak in the system seems like it's exploitable but I guess it's it is just knocking explode because there's bigger New York City right and I know people that have you know three locks on their front door and you know forget to shut the window at night you know there's like
 they're like so many easier ways for somebody to defraud the system than what you described that yeah I mean it's sophisticated very hard to do and we know it is happening and no reason we've got a pretty good answer for it but I certainly not the easiest way to do it yeah yeah yeah so yeah I know we're doing yet time where are these Bots coming from are they originating in Russia because you must have seen this on Twitter the Trump one hashtag was like trending and it was originated like all of the Day hashtags were originated from Russia so like the question was are these Russian people that are just like happy that Trump won the quote unquote won the debate or are they Bots that are trying to make this hashtag trend Eastern Europe
 there are they come out of Asia as well and there's a lot originally from the u.s. actually significant and out Andy and you can actually see from traffic patterns that we have
 as many in the states although I don't know if they're sophisticated what you might see from other countries I've been well thank you for coming to show it's been a pleasure talking to you I find the ad fraud industry quiet and final ad tech industry interesting and I look forward to talking to Tyler

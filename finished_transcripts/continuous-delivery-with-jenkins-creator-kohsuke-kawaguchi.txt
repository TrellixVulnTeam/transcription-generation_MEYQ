Transcription: cosas que kawaguchi is the primary developer of Jenkins continuous-integration he's also the CTO of cloudbees which provides Enterprise Jenkins hello thank you for having me is continuous integration alright so I think for me it means automation so that means I'm freeing up people's time cuz when I was walking out the individual engineer like that we need to push my walk off the other people or the other computers basically so that's how I started for me Define Luba differently Lowry focusing more on the integration part of the integration of the Boston bling go to PCS but I think
and your BPD aspect automation, that's how I see it
 and what problem does it solve
 alright I'm sorry yes and I talked about you so I wanted to make sure that it doesn't break somebody else that might basically my colleague so I have to make sure that I ran tests all the time locally before I send me my changes stuff like that I don't have to do that anymore good but I think they make some mistakes and we all make mistakes you know what the guy have this confidence about making changes like the things that I might be flying from doing otherwise I might be willing to take on because I feel like I'm safe
 and I ate a deal I got that made all the difference could you describe it by giving an example maybe of a of a feature how would you develop a feature and then use continuous integration
 right I think it's the very first thing that bill from people new to this try to build on This Server so every basically every time somebody checks in you change into The Source Code system and summer program somewhere and then the results based on sales in a razor so I can give me steaks are there in the guy who made the mistake of people get the idea that I like this is very helpful they can you take it from there
 it's also like Rhonda deployment the somewhere so that humans can go to the site and innovate see the latest software in the works and I have design nursing and so the scope of organization expands and that's how I see it originated with extreme programming what is Extreme programming alright yeah so that's sexy. And I think the extreme practice I think Rita's ambulatory Mt Vernon various different practices that I try to help her
 important event that I think about it and I think it's can become more productive and I like that allows for a higher level approach of continuous deployment or continuous delivery differentiate continuous integration from a continuous delivery or continuous deployment Roxy cracking Blumenthal I can many ways it's just the same kind of automation but you just expand it down the free chainsaw it been going appointment testing on vehicle staging environment for the controlling the Florida from the cast
 pretty decent Salon United States
 what were you trying to do it's still very technical like engineering concerns on the Spalding cancel the pain points but they understand the idea and taking time off a different kind of Socrates key moment that back where this made of material of implementing continuous integration
 explaining the need for somebody that they should be doing this but I when I go to the farm where I came from but I still get out get to talk to a lot of people who eat for free in this is not this is not something that's obvious I have to explain why they need. And then I'll mostly like it's something that we struggle and it's kind of like being asked my daughter like why I make the dinner already I tried to send the cost of incandescent aggression I think it's there if you haven't if you haven't had a test for example some people don't even have that for the Buick Street
 and I'm not quite completely on those places they don't even have the NFL scored migrant system like at you when you get to the ticket you need something little small like a very small and then get some smooth each other and our be improved
 when to pitch Jenkins two people that is there a surprising surprising number of projects. For example they have a chance and then so yeah I don't know but I have to make I have my mystery contacting these the color system integration companies right so they are the one that's trying to show up the load and practices inside the company so they are the one that's fighting the fighting I'm trying to find them and try to be more right
 I mean just speaking from your own cultural Roots it is it a cultural issue or is it just like an endemic issue that happened to develop in Japan for some reason you just have you have no idea why this this occurs Silicon Valley is kind of a special Echo chamber so maybe I can countries Mississippi software development
 it has to do with my point is I don't think I said to do with like Japanese culture anything as much as just like Silicon Valley is a kind of power on the power of the development process adoption are there companies in Independence example of competing at the Vault face and then these guys and service the company that's running water during Sunday like I say social gaming sites and saw these people. State Tollway still don't see the technology of their core Crossing maybe that's what creating this Android
 continuous integration and continuous delivery are highly relevant to devops and this is devops week on software engineering daily so it seems delivery so relevant to devops
 right I'm so that way I can bring some people can I basically didn't mean to say Hobs grapes and that they have the cash ready for world like we're at the demo for if they have the assistance management system checking out the cold running tests and stuff like that but cool space sniper Chef for shift for the
 people to walk more and more like the bumper sticker today and Wednesday also. Maybe I can find this entire we got cold and it so whenever we make changes that so I can go see the beauty grass because they be resting by linking sentence. Basically the whole walkthrough of operations people like they're starting to look more and more like being useful what I got another 5-10 years ago or something like that
 it's being used for so long before they were out so long I saw that. Also help with some of that works at Chef Colin Campbell and he said that is less about a specific role or set of responsibilities than an Audiology he related to the idea of the lean Enterprise where you have experimentation and agile movement do you agree with this that that devops is sort of the process of supporting and encouraging the the experimentation in the agility
 yeah I think yeah be interesting aspect for some people is that they did not coming so the devil Personal Creations people walk a little more closely and trying to line their goal around come on goals and so on and I think that the body deer point then about you're saying I guess what the what the what cooling said I shouldn't need to probably about like I have obituaries liking a beypointer vehicle in this space and it for me did it interesting aspect is the fact that there's are, so that governments be to shut those people like that
 align the interest or share their experience in so long so that's kind of the aspect of text me interested in
 to mention your company cloudbees provides Enterprise level Jenkins support Lincoln Street as my Home Depot and gradually grow to the point that the new States became more and more serious in the industries and it starts with the fact that there is no one else no commercial entity to lean on for these guys started receiving about if you have basically what did he makes the solution buyable for some people I did nothing about it
 are you talking about the large organization or skill the phone and then you know this passage is adapted to the point that that's happening there everyday everywhere in these people need to really appreciate you define the word support in Sierra Vista. Useful so for example one of them helping people and I know those are only interesting through that's a company Sue might have like hundreds of thousands of little purse very cost-effective that's the kind of using that you're so thank you for that I think I think it's kind of situation
 I've been doing the shows for for about 3 or 4 weeks now and it really has been a trend that red hat kind of lay the ground for a business model that people in every software vertical are following whether it's cloudy confluent the Kafka company is doing this with cryptocurrency I mean in cryptocurrency platform have a software cup like 9 yeah I think I'd also died but I open so sky that to the wall that's open so such a long handstand that you like
 Arabic movie Saga engineer like it's difficult for me to imagine building anything on top of like a pro prior to these things for me so I think it's great you're quite the proven mother I know one that I find out of the parsonage Orion business different interesting I just did a week of shows on databases and one company that did not fall in line with this sequel so it's interesting I don't know what the how you define when you make that is an exception to this open source rule but it's interesting question
 yeah yeah I mean for me that's kind of know that choice but like I said that's already have the time it's on community and hauling around the world lots of different places and they can still talk to people who like to the biscuit knows me and it's a great feeling to Copenhagen. We going to be having the street corner somewhere in Copenhagen and I have no idea otherwise
 continuous delivery to cinegration continuous delivery allows for very fast feedback how does this fast feedback loop affect development
 yeah so I think someone of it is that they eat by by reducing the time in which something is broken. It makes it easier to you programmed in so that kind of thing so I think I used to be because you know you don't know you just wouldn't find out every time something stop breaking down by somebody and so that means you can bring your dollars
 radio connecting to the business Depot in Topsham Inception to be running software Empire value nearest places that use Jenkins of also worked at places that don't and have a different continuous delivery system of proprietary system there are there are things that are true to all continuous Delivery Systems and then there are other things that are not true frog taste Delivery Systems which in some sense means that all continuous
 three systems have some degree of opinion.
 Right on yeah so I think I'd like to think the so where they are the secondary source of anything like that I think that would be that it software needs to be expensive all that is in a repeat yesterday for the first time users are they stop using it in like I gassed it if it does this little thing like we were differently your instead of doing this or that kind of
 so I'm thinking about what we wanted what I wanted to do you still have that people do that kind of thing sweetheart we had stepping onto each other's somebody else can you try to the concert backing up create a nice milligram for these conflicting interested in Jenkins this being like Angelina driven software are you almost ate all right. That thing coming out of that kind of you all need our own time book and I want to be my own thing but I'm going to do anything away that's not going to have negative impact how an opinionated it is that's a great way
 veterans that you see implemented using Jenkins Minnesota crime scene investigator themes system of record that's the what is the official attitude from the team that's funny Crystal the time that's the other, things rain guards organization I see that they used to them in the tracking record korte so things like I could average or some kind of tracking some metrics springs on the table is
 say you're running their find bugs that can looking at your problem so it's like A7 is critical and then today might say we had like SMP programs I'm so embarrassed. Timeline send information to be useful and also thank you for the side effect of making the form of visible did the people outside the team so if you are like a large large am talking about painting is responsible for their own part then stimulating and sharing this information across the team so that the central guy to compare how different things to do in having this transparency DVDs for sale
 it's kind of cold and all this is mine regularly and then again you might have to be before you switch this a running step going to staging you might want some she wants to come in person about on the computer is still call me or choreographing the entire activity but got some key points at I'm like a you can design your monster come in so thinking husband died last year y'all did this system go Jenkins walks out and then lots to do you enable in this kind of you Stacy that we see all the time now
 how does chickens have Synergy with a microservices architecture independent component and that's the benefit so that's something to throw the mission can provide which is why I'm thinking Styles it's also I think it's also important that can be like I'm driving Services you kind of want to keep your stomach need to keep track of what's your name what would it show picture of the whole thing and it said that also need some kind of system of record state that can reach for the void when buy food at
 information. Also needs to happen. Like a hold of retention divided up into small tank if you want to do that say so there's a friend I'm going to need to slow progress way ticket and then to the staging and then to the to the collection department and if you think about you bringing any stuck up different more than the small component to making sure that the whole thing Rock together in the last email Sarah. Abigail deceptive Origins and history chapter than Frozen and I need 3D produces rebuildable
 guess it's pretty good at microservices makes for a more decentralized environment where you can push code more aggressively the inmate I think I'm anyways that's the case that's like I got the key point of do you mind if I could choreograph in coordinating that I can give it to your brother like a team's so I think it's the decentralization of power do you think you sent that to you got the right now I think the 1060 old Fighting speeding ticket in Kingstree just about anything
 Authority Caprice or anything anything because it's quite so I think it kind of goes back to be my audio recording device we need to be able to Chef be used with Jenkins wish I could allow you to miscarry speed up the ultimate
 . he's been in ICU mix changes the chef recipes you want to make sure that the changes kosher they want to run past you on the Run pinti want to check they are okay sorry about something then he's going to be very well and I made you finally vacuum that you can use and still drinking since I'm great thank you sweets sure if your recipes are Kosher I had not heard that that double entendre before you swallow every year for the past 5 years or so because they have exactly what are the synergies between Docker and Jenkins
 if you use the company using container that you need to feel like I've gotta show me with you be developing like a or using container has a unique pet spayed and Don's been throwing away the crappy we did he makes it a whole lot easier to create a big container Savory pipeline around them so now you can speak now it's A5 clones of the same application that's slightly different between them and test them and throw them away so now I think I know to be combined. Ra spielautomaten
 scriptable choreographed all power of being received if you kind of drinks that don't grow Kool-Aid you can you can you can leave the benefits of actually be completely the other way around that is benefiting actually running company, and they don't leave any garbage behind. So the things you can use containers
 other you don't go to double birth control lock the container is so you can always like a little portion control the right tools in the Bluetooth hoverboards on since the other side of the thinking still going to go drink the Kool-Aid of doctor is how would you differentiate the ability of Afro chickens to synergize with Docker as compared to what was available prior to Docker in terms of Linux containerization
 sorry for the inconvenience so let's say after the state of the program like from the source code and then of the in Union currently exposed batsuit the testing and then I'm very different kind of test
 and then eventually. Because the one that you ship all. That's the one that we can see that. So when you know the fact of it's been raining like a coupon so cold springs factors in the environment that CD I think that God makes the world the principle of the principal continuous delivery stronger than before. I think the call Will tea help you create
 I love you too sorry through your pipeline deisler things
 how does Version Control interact with Jenkins
 oh boy the city so when I think it's called me to tell me test it separately and then you know you're quite substantial degree so that helps you attendees to eat, and a lot I think it's kind of interesting aspects that nowadays I don't know maybe we should I wish progress announcer for me
 he's relevant for devops that you could you know one of the things that he text you the whole runtime environment into itself and then you can launch it so if your if you think about it like in your you're pretty you're comparing yourself clothing TV container and he wants to test them imagine like you have lots of people pushing each and every minute and if this takes like a $5 around so your mom is like that if you want to take this container that was fueled and then run me somewhere you don't take care of every promise he doesn't need to be running it somewhere and I run the past and then at the end of it you want to shut that down
 can you sleep by Kennedy's face is the runtime environment that can actually run the application is most like I'm pretty sure they have a series like a wall mounted TV that says I have you ain't even the environment into station hey I got a guy need some place around here you can use the Philadelphia Marvin so let me ask you one it is easy to create
 applications you need so are you spell we've talked about a lot of a far-reaching Technologies I'd like to bring it back to Earth in terms of the continuous delivery are continuous integration discussion with some more simple question if a user has both mobile and web application versions of their application how does this fragmentation affect the continuous delivery process
 I'm So yeah so do when you have those two pieces independently the doctor that arises just need for integration so that way you know I'd imagine two teams and you better leave Arsenal those things so that means make sure that you need to make sure that what they're producing we'll walk together and when they start to get out of sync like we want to know ASAP and then order that can we want we need to eat after that I got to at the margin of vodka and in the mobile. That's annoying to walk together so that we can together going to production right so I kind of take out the choreography coordination discovering the problem
 how does continuous integration affect a b testing
 I decided I don't think so because they race in itself doesn't have thing of direct impact in there but they're very kind of you become so I suppose very much is there any running bring out the point of doing the testing of being surrounding rare because you're trying to compare those three things and then they originate from some changes type of source code used around here so that something automation next in case could you provide very well and also a farming gold permission to be able to create that kind of environment and I think that something people usually have that kind of thing is
 dude I freaking scared to see me so they they usually do that but I don't think I don't know if One Direction I mean maybe right why is it important to run test in a non developer machine prior to push into production yeah so when I think now they're so there are a couple of answers to that I think he's the only one I think is that is that it's it's much cheaper to use servers to run tests and then free after the first time and attention to work on something else you can think clearly expensive now compared to a computer so every second that we keep our eye with your fingers waiting for the PSP complete dogs that are wasted money so I think there is definitely that
 come on I can understand it better for the team Tacoma guys together
 does continuous-integration change or eliminate the need for QA
 I think it does change the role somewhere when I was originally at some time I've spent on actually running the testing they are getting that they are picking up the beach that's in the lower part of the day do they run the test results report epoxy need the writing test patient abuse test on banking make it happen every time the new binary car so you don't have to be you constantly looking at your inbox for the email from the meat on the past. Did it help
 Rebecca disability rating for the past two weeks I probably I probably need to look at that and there's another one because they so you tell Siri to disseminate information desk then that designed to help designs Australia motorcycle way that's the thing
 Santa Fe bolt patterns
 I think the only on Skype or something that I can think of is basically stopped paying attention to you what what what all the programs that this year is already reporting anyways the point is only to use 4 cycle so you did something and then you know these reports past results I can save your ass and then the devil part you it's on the author of it she didn't exist
 sorry I did the car number 5 seconds in Jenkins like a long run is at Chuck Norris plugging in the zero useful function every pays in vain conceit show these tiny Technologies quote I can have it programmed by just talking but that's good enough to talk to me the habit forming behavior for about 5 years what has changed in that time
 so there's a number of changes and I think the one that I'm kind of excited about right now it's cold enough people I think it's expanding to the largest called we need more capable tool to describe the formation of the chain choreograph I can open that cost more to am I saying sometimes did she even meet with her to keep pouring can be your lies and stuff like that so I think you're being around for about a year now and that is I think it's really useful to to cater to the needs of the people
 who makes Jenkins be something you have to come to this do that and then do something else and then you could spell still these people if you're sexy even though these and lots of things in many ways I can get the wrapping up on board applications what to do for each of these two hundred bucks to keep on increasing between 4 ways to be more scalable more meat scalable didn't consider the project that's going on to Define this kind of instruction inside the body
 already did a couple days before going on call Jodi cell plugging it is stinking Spike what to do this 300 things by using a long folded driving them over going to be like in Destin right there every day so I can keep track of everything but that's the kind of thing that I'm important aspect of continuous delivery that we have not discussed
 yeah what's the most what's the yeah I don't know
 I think about I guess that's the one thing I buy the project and I even though I'm working on it and I didn't have the guts to go ask for money that can be useful. I think about you being able to explain this what we had what is automation bringing the other people
 everything to you have you do more and they have other resources up for cloudbees well I love to know that I think it's so far it's going out roller coaster ride I think you are very I'm thinking six times that I quite like our company has been growing very rapidly cool coaster cat, Gucci thanks for coming out to software engineering daily it's been great talking to you

Transcription: in order to use a remote desktop experience software Engineers have a limited number of options and most of them are proprietary like a VMware Oracle remote desktop is a functionality that many Engineers use everyday so it is surprising that the open-source world has taken a while to displace the functionality of proprietary software in 2010 Mike jumper started working on guacamole a way to access remote desktops through your browser over the last 6 years Mike has worked continuously to create a simple open source software tool to access remote desktops and this year guacamole joined the Apache software foundation and became Apache guacamole in this episode we discussed the past present and future of remote desktop in the technical internals of Apache guacamole if you are interested in sponsoring software engineering daily or you want to advertise on the show please send me an email at software engineering daily at G
dot-com I am looking for sponsors for Q3 if you enjoy this episode please share it and if you have any questions or criticism please send me an email or tweet and with that said get your tortilla chips ready for this delicious episode Apache guacamole with Mike jumper
 applications crash problems happen and when those problems happen if you want to fix them immediately honey badger notifies you about errors and outages in your web application and honey Patrick gives you the information that you need to fix those problems honey badger is always watching Honey Badger will notify you when your problem occurs and aggregate information about each of the users who are affected by that problem until you fix it try out honey badger at software engineering daily.com honey badger Heroku eBay and digitalocean are all using honey badger to monitor their applications Integrations with slack GitHub and Jiro let you easily communicate crashes and exceptions to the rest of your team with honey badger you can get back to the work that you love and stop sorting through the distracting unimportant errors go to software engineering daily.com honey badger and try it for yourself
 it would also support software engineering daily software engineering date.com honey badger you don't get to choose when your next Crisis is going to happen so choose honey badger
 Mike jumper is the founding developer of Apache guacamole a Client List remote desktop Gateway Mike welcome to software engineering daily let's start with the basics remote desktop what does that term mean it's just a way for you to access your desktop remotely over some sort of networking protocol CNN RDP being the most common one spend as far as in its own way episodes could be considered such a thing as for remote desktop well in the past it was mainly a way for you to access a machine when you have no other means to do so nowadays it's it's becoming more and more of that you would do a choice if we ourselves and in the office we we use guacamole to do oral all our guacamole development it's it's become the way that I primarily access my uncle
 what are the remote desktop products that have existed in the past
 star besides typical BNC I mean Microsoft RDP for quite some time they continue to build it into Windows there is a number Commercial solutions that people are familiar with TeamViewer John manthan song that people use on a daily basis or tamales only relatively recently for RDP versus the higher-level products could you help differentiate between these two classes of B&C technology called so I can't really speak whatever they do to use certainly only they know what it is behind the scenes things like I have to pee but you can. I think used to be proprietary until very recently won for Microsoft opened up the documentation
 but in terms of something like being see where you have an actual publicly. Many protocol there are number number of implementation North open source and not proprietary extensions and open source extensions to the same and then at the opposite extreme you have something like TeamViewer or join me or the other products which you need to use their products to access their product and then whatever Secret Sauce to use in pie the scenes to do that to mitigation between the best stop in the client at Stats all hidden the problems with these remote software products that people have been using in the past probably still an issue but now that it has gotten much faster it's less of a concern accessibility is is even more so a problem acquiring a specific
 plant specific software probably going to specific device in order to access your machine in the whole point of remote desktop is is that you can access computer from somewhere else requiring that you need to pick early software computer to do it seems to be self-defeating
 okay so now that we've given a reasonable preface what is Apache guacamole there's been some debate about the term but client was here means that you don't need to install a client to use it there is no client it's a web-based client you use a web browser to access but since the web browser is a big old is ubiquitous it's almost not worth considering gauge running on the server the you are accessing but you do not need any special software on the client that is being used to access the remote server it's just all the work is all the heavy software is on server you just have to sit through a web browser so is this simply a matter of convenience or is there a performance gain to this model
 Kobe performance gains one of the nice things that the Gateway actually does is it attempts to optimize the secrets of updates and servers providing in the case of I forgot Apple and see which which has historically been rather slow we apply additional compression on top of that to pay or jpeg her web P which may not actually be used on the other side we combine updates in the way that make it a bit faster we also augment protocol for example we take the NCS awesome graphics and pulseaudio is a source of audio streaming and in to leave those two streams near the guacamole protocol produce both sound and video on the client side guacamole in 2010 you have continued working on it all the way to 2016 what was the inspiration for the project
 why have you been working on it for so long
 as long as I have since it's sort of been my baby it started when I was working at a different company which had relatively strict Network rules and I don't know this isn't very uncommon probably why the project is done so well but I started it as a means of access of my own machine I originally wrote a web-based own accord and this was just terminal based access but after that started working out well and I realized it's been done many times over there I want to do something different so start looking towards VNC Android VNC client and then that over iterations on iterations changed into Gateway as critical support moved outside of the application into the special event Roxy thing in the back end and just got more General in more performance and now it's a gateway
 we're going to talk about the Damon model of the internals of guacamole but first give us an explanation of these remote desktop protocol is like the sea and argue no more of an explanation of how these work probably most listeners are not familiar with the internals of these things at all actually heard heard of them at the most basic level VNC for example of the simplest of the bunch you just have a sequence of rectangular updates being sent the screen so whenever something changes on the remote display the area that is changing is sent over the network and then the client draw is it according to what are the protocols telling it to do is more complex variations on this you know if you're scrolling something for example you don't necessarily want to resend all that dated you can just copy it move it up a bit and then redraw the part that actually changed
 this is all mainly a time space trade-off for save video if you think of the opposite extreme we have pre-recorded video that's very efficient but the processing is much more intense and without dedicated Hardware you can't really rely on streaming that in real time. Not in the way where you could react to something happening on the screen that you have in a hundred hundred milliseconds latency on your desktop it's very unpleasant experience was with us then we can go the opposite direction where you have some reasonable compression but there's not that much processing applied with the intent of providing some sort of real-time responsiveness so it'll end up using more bandwidth for the same type of changes but it's it's more optimized for lower complexity graphics and faster next time between update
 you've given us an overview of how these protocols have historically worked what goes on in the communication so it's explain the communication from a high-level between the client web browser and the guacamole server just as a reminder guacamole server is the one that's running all the heavy lifting software the client just has to have a web browser it's all the only access point have to do so give us an overview of the high-level communication very high-level this is just a tunnel between the client and the server and that's managed by a bee what application and then the right of the patient functions as the sort of authenticating proxy in front of the demon which we've mentioned which has no concept of multiplication
 if I can go up to a lower level than that there's a generalized protocol the guacamole protocol and that's the only thing the client speaks it's the duty of the demon that we've mentioned to translate do you want us to particles to the guacamole protocol and the duty of the weapon location to proxy bat and applying authentication layer in front of it to protect the access to these remote desktops for Farmington generalization I like I mentioned before guacamole was originally a VNC client and in fact it was a VNC over XML client so you can imagine that might not be the best design choice
 it's the detective protocol was derived from Hartley the needs of the agency but I'm part of the needs of the architecture since those were redesigning things to fit a more abstract Gateway model and not this specific DNC model we had to reconsider what it meant for the remote desktop protocol rather than being simply the JavaScript extension to B&C we wanted to think of the protocol is essentially a remote display and she tried abstract away most of his operations so that it's just the duty of a demon to translate whatever needs to translate being crdp to the most efficient display instructions that it can the protocol itself is text-based and this was this was done so the JavaScript to be able to process it officially
 is specifically designed so that JavaScript can process it in the Stream with minimal overhead you talking more detail about why you needed to be text based in order to accomplish that constraint of JavaScript being able to digest it tomato a matter of minimizing the processing on the client side and this is another case of A Spacetime trade off while we sacrificed small amounts of space efficiency here and very small amounts and also to make sure that the processing disorder fast while it might seem that text would be a lot less efficient than binary I think that's that's a bit of an archaic respective in water times did the difference shouldn't be very noticeable the amount of overhead on a pack of bases and Kirby guacamole
 due to the text is small in JavaScript while just might not be so much the case now with the offers and binary websocket frames at 1 o'clock and it was definitely the case that if you want to do anything and don't ask what to eat to help you guys don't text any time to do something in binary you would end up with a large amount of overhead it would take far more processing to handle that kind of data than the games you would get through the the smaller amount space use
 Sports Talk The Talk about the heavier of the two interaction points which is the guacamole server again the client is very light the server is doing the heavy lifting what is in the guacamole sure if I have a machine somewhere what do I have to install a kayak I know I feel insulted guacamole server it's going to be running it's going to make it make my server able to receive a client web browser experiences is glue made up of two components to two main packages there's one piece that we call guacamole client which is the web application that serves the client so not a misnomer is a service I can call in to service the clinic and then there's the certainty server behind that guacamole server and that has quantity which is the guacamole demon as well as
 complementation switch are plugins for a little Library said it loads based on what are all the calls going to be using to connect the remote desktop so you have this model where there's still what application in front which is written in Java and it does almost no processing it's just the effing kidding, that is served the JavaScript client to those that have access and then it establishes a TCP connection to block P if you can have access to his machines and based on that quantity then directly translates being CRT pssh as necessary to the guacamole protocol just forwarded through the back locations and then out to the client
 okay can you give a give a little more detail about about that interaction between the the front facing side of the guacamole server and the back end of the back end and just give me a picture for how information flows between those two components and then how I guess how it gets pushed to the client and just kind of describe maybe like the cycle of interaction cuz I can imagine like Instagram this client I'm moving my mouse around I want the server to be updating this is quickly as possible so maybe you could just describe what is going on I guess is I'm moving my mouse or as I'm you know shrinking a window or whatever is the canonical explanation you would like to give it would help me understand the client at the interaction between the client the front end of the guacamole server in the back end of guacamole server architecture
 distance of business communication Channel it doesn't matter how many notes there are along this channel where that you have to climb from your web application in a proxy and I want to call forwarding data back and forth very quickly with low latency so it's just imagine you have the client and expect the surgery and there's anything Central on this communication channel is being sent is guacamole Chronicle which at its lowest level is simply a stream of instructions the instructions follow standard format that it. That's not important in the documentation but it's listening to that is not cooking very interesting statistic instructions when you move the mouse that's one instruction tells it but most part of his moved chicken application and it updates the state of the mouse buttons to push to release the keys and it sends an event about to change and keyboard State what do you press a key or release the key and some only on the server side
 when these things happen it instructions are being sent to the client in the Stream that contain images along with with locations to draw them instructions copying to and from parts of the screen saving data for buffering later it's it's all these these individual atoms instructions of the atoms of the protocol and it's the the string in the five mystery from the server being combined to produce the overall experience that you using a desktop remote server going for it yes because screen sharing is something that we're just finishing up now but in general it depends on the protocol BNC for example if you have multiple connect me to it most B&C servers will replicate displaystate across all those connections and it will just work
 normally no normally the windows slow prevent multiple access if you have one person logged in someone else's there are ways around this some sometimes you can configure a server to allow multiple guacamole itself doesn't impose any such a restriction translates whatever you want the mission screen sharing that's that's something that we just finished and we're just adding to the interface but that adds display application on top of protocols that he might not support it otherwise the creepy so when you get your Yak definitely do this a little bit deeper into the the way that the only server works the guacamole has a native proxy Damon called guac D explain what a native proxy Damon is an explain agua caddy is
 I don't know dealers in this case just means that it runs natively on the server it's radiancy its not Java or JavaScript it's this nice scene I didn't we being a background processes something what's running on the server in the background listening for Connections in this case coming from the web application and then doing something with those connections in this case handling the Bakuman protocol and calling the appropriate plug into translate from guacamole protocol to the remote desktop? Point of guacamole is the Java API which is provided by guacamole it's called guacamole common and it provides this means a ton of data between the client and the native proxy game so I guess this is the this is the front facing is just a front the front facing part of the back and you were talking about that was still look like
 play between the front and we're getting closer to the front but not not quite there is the Java API total yes but I'm not sure you would entirely sets front facing the front facing part is the job script client and that is guacamole common JS both of those two things on the the main body of the API which drives the one application or if people want to implement a guacamole powered by the application of their own which is the intent they can use these aprs to do so
 so what are if I understand it's crazy what are some other applications people could build using guacamole, guacamole, and Jas just about everything that could involve remote desktop access which is pretty broad I can't go into too much detail of the same people that I remember of a company that specifics of what they do but I can tell you that it's very very bad things that we never thought that people would change about that stuff to do they use Remote Desktop to do it more intuitively if you are a cloud service provider or you have a number of machine do you want to provide access to somewhere in the great and guacamole into your app or deploying guacamole for set your employees access be great ways to do it then
 I had a crazy idea couple weeks ago it's a photo sharing app that only has pictures of cats when I finish my photo sharing Cat application I will be deploying it to Linda because Leonard is the fastest hosted Lennox provider I don't want to get locked into a proprietary platform it's going to overcharge me as soon as my app gets popular I just want a fast Linux server with simple pricing go to lenovo.com SE daily and get $20 in free credit today plans start at $10 a month so my free $20 will be plenty to wash my cat photo sharing app once I need to scale I can use tools like an ode balancers and backups and the note has built-in dashboarding and metrics so that I can see the traffic to my linode servers and I can understand how many of my users are posting cat pictures and looking at each other's cat pictures go to anode
 kaam SE daily and get $20 in free credit today the plans start at $10 a month that's a great deal thanks to linode for sponsoring a software engineering Daily Now what's going on to this episode
 so I wanted to just walk through the technical DD beef the end-to-end interaction from a technical perspective one more time and then discussions but it's good because I know you already touched on you gave a high-level Kai walkthrough of how things are how things work but now that we kind of build up a little more context for how this whole system works could you could you give another into end explanation for how the interaction works baby referencing some of the the other lower-level components would discuss feel like if I'm a client I want to log into a server run and guacamole and how are on the server may be like I don't know login in like check some stuff for window around or whatever exactly want to give walkthrough what happens on a little more technical granularity okay so Krista the users going to be logging in to the web application I'm going to assume the second Simplicity were talking about the web app and not some third-party application
 how many service calls to authenticate the user once that is done they will have an off token they will be logged in further about service calls will be made to retrieve the list of connections they have access to Mill Creek on a connection that the actual web page client will kick in and it's it's duty at this point is to establish the tunnel and that will depend on the Buffalo browser supports for communication little use cider HTTP or websocket depending on the father has support website with which all modern browsers should at this point and whether the network itself allows this as some proxies will inhibit websocket root function once once the tunnel has been established the one application
 what makes the connection to guac P & Sons at the configuration information of the connection and then quality and establishes a connection to the remote desktop server on behalf of the medication that is doing this on behalf of the user and once all that is established the communication flows the client sends instructions through the publication which Fords them to go out to eat what should I do translate send to whatever the remote desktop leads to consume and summer only one there was something that might want to call which is forwarded through the tunnel to the client which is been processed by JavaScript and rounded to the screen from a higher level the guacamole is free and open source explain what the advantages of making the software open source are
 what is transparency is there is an obvious one from earlier in this conversation relation proprietary protocols being able to see what is Protocols are doing by your information is being handled being able to say investigate the source for potential vulnerabilities are you can contribute to it so important one of the main things that differentiates guacamole from the competition is the fact that it's open and I both noticed that one of the main reasons the people that switched words using it be on but it works well or are they all other Alternatives and proprietary
 how to say that there aren't any other advantages to the software I mean we use it ourselves the whole point is that it's fast as good but one of the main dividing factors the fact that you can see the source you can do whatever you want with the source and there's no say log in to a particular vendor where if you want to use this particular software stack you suddenly need to 1 pay for it and to commit to using it essentially in until you can find an alternative there's no way that you could stay with it and not have to continue to pay for these two components of sounds like a Target that are the problem of organizations getting locked into using the super clunky remote desktop Solutions and the added to the transparency that you get and and you know it's like the more eyes are on it obviously the more things you can get ironed out
 I think like
 remote desktop is one of these things were like it's one of those things where it's a pain that companies of live with for so long it just becomes something that they've accepted it's like one of these things where you just forget that you just kind of like it take it for granted and then he's like you know once you see what you see like at your step changed oh my goodness how did I not notice this pain in the past I can think of like all the different companies I've worked at work just like remote desktop and just think this is so slow but I didn't even think about it because all the previous organization said worth it had that same thing interesting you know why why have we lived with this pain for so long why has nobody
 worked on or I mean I guess you've been doing it for 6 years is such a hard problem that like you know generally you know an open-source contributor might like look at this problem be like
 you don't think I'm just going to go build a JavaScript framework or she's very very most problems are hard and as far as realizing that a problem exists that's always the question right most of these things people you have a problem you didn't realize you had it but you can look up just about any inventions / / I'm at 800 Garrison present that's always been the case
 right so when did guacamole get incubated under the Apache organization that was earlier this year February I think so if you have an open source project a community that you wish to bring into the Apache Foundation you need to do that through the incubator you can't just hop in and enjoying as a top of a project you need to become accustomed to the Apache way of doing things the processes and build a community around the software that the whole point is not for say the software to be kind of hard to project and then we hope the community joins in later does that the community exists and that it grows in that once the communities self-sufficient and and thriving then sure topic
 if you go to that website and see if you got the Molly incubating the point is to to get into this growth phase where you are introduced to the Apache prostitutes and you prove that the front of the the community is there and that the project is properly functioning as far as Apache is concerned and then it's up to a community and the queen of the incubator and then finally attaching itself to decide what the project actually gets in as a topical project
 what is The Descent of momentum that you're getting from the the community like what to what degree I haven't looked at the GitHub repo I haven't looked at the number of contributors but how big is the is the workforce around the open source project getting it's still relatively small on the project we only have at the moment 3/4 meeting regular project members that are writing code that's myself James Milner and Fred l'angolo sorry if I'm not saying your last name properly but beyond that we have contributors who are not necessarily quitters on the project but have been contributing in the past I would say we have anywhere between 10 or 20th but when we Stood Beside contributors that occasional provide code and it's part of the process that if he's contributors
 do this regularly in and they show that they will then eventually the Opera commercial but so far there is mainly the three of us I think that one of the primary reasons community at least about the community of as far as my route is small has been informed in the area and to the fact that guacamole is relatively new as far as products are concerned
 so have any I mean you are cement you run a company who glyptodon and we can talk about that later but we have companies gotten involved with guacamoles open source project very high degree you know it's an Apache we can't really tie clip that honor 8 a company directly to it but it is it is the case that historically quilted on was developing guacamole we wrote the original and been done gave away all week maintain it through it through confucians to the project that runs under Apache as much I am still a commuter out but it was before that migration it was sort of a company charter that this always be open and free and every time we do say business or someone to make a change that change be open
 and speaking purely as as the company that the project again or separate something before weed is very important and since we could see it obviously nothing but this is something we leaving is not the cervix fish if you decide to put giving it to Apache to be the best thing to do
 your work on this company called glyptodon as I understand glyptodon provides Enterprise support for guacamole show tons of Enterprises need this remote desktop from the browser functionality what's the business model for glyptodon how similar is it to the open-source business models of red hat or Cloudera support we differ from a lot of these other companies and that we don't ever do private area changes when we do if if necessary modify other people's say proprietary sauce and then it has to stay as it is but changes to the guacamole we always keep open and then come to be back
 other than that I'd say it's very similar we use the interest from from Enterprises and then other companies to help guide development on our end and and then hopefully to provide contribution to the project that have been accepted
 guacamole aims to make cloud-hosted desktop access preferable to local traditional access that is tagline of guacamole I think it's a very Noble Pursuit how far away from that Vision are you I don't know if I would say we're closer than we are far it's okay I should have some rather Goku members who are not so diplomatic
 look up what's your question was like how far away from that Vision are you in advance to bake a question like turtles to getting there before we use walking ballista call guacamole changing to play on my project hat as the project we adopted the same way for it all on our computers use guacamole guacamole so at least from my perspective we were already doing this using guacamole as our only means of accessing these desktops that we used to develop apart
 as far as the general cases concerned and main thing holding back this from being widely accepted are the more intense use cases like gaming settings for what you would need special Hardware to handle real time encoding in a more generalized video Codec something that doesn't have that same time space trade-off is coming to all the tallest building Hardware is getting cheaper and people nowadays do you have service with bad processors and things that can handle this type of encoding Realty Advisors are increasingly supporting these more common video codecs which could be used for this and then you can imagine but as a spaceship in 10 years that it's going to be even more useful arguably you don't necessarily want to use something other remote desktop I do but I can't stay for the world
 I think everybody should want to but if you really liked it like a lap around and see if I got locked up I don't see why not but in the general case you can imagine that you have such a pretty day for some sort of engineering software it's more intense for the level of computing power are required if it comes prohibitive to continue to get the necessary Hardware to do this it would be better if say a larger entity that has the oldest Edition servers and power to maintain themselves simply provides that has a service
 more realistic anyway I look at these expensive devices that I have like an iPhone and a Mac laptop that I'm talking to you on right now and you know I've started to get this feeling maybe others don't share this but the it just feels really primitive and it feels kind of silly because like I'm using these super expensive things with services in the cloud because I need fault tolerance and like this these Jewel things that I that I used to do computation I basically used to access the web browser right now I have like I do you know it would not when I'm like the pan for an interview for example I have two web browsers open it like next week it's just like it's just there's something seems really weird and wrong about what I actually it's it's getting increasingly weird
 men frames and things in the in this was the way that you're moving to now is the way things were done back then right where you have been staring at Computer Resources because they were rare and then one with the Advent the first year LeBron started buying the row machine that was all the great thing but now that the internet is so prevalent in Fast and you can actually handle these things are migrating back and it seems like such an incredible waste power but can you imagine how much could cute pet capacity there is a cross to say all the various types of elderberries fancy graphics cards across Sadie the entire country or World application and waste of resources nice if you had a more centralized system elastic would be would it be for everybody to maintain their own power generator that you might be something you need to do in some situations but it's certainly not what everybody would do you you'd want to have a central Authority and then
 one consumes from the central authority of it is rather good at providing this absolutely and yet the pendulum of swinging between thick client and thin client and this is been swinging back and forth I mean I feel like it's one of the trends of computer science has just been going on forever so is it plausible that maybe our computers like our are desktops in the future like the third the processing that is going to be done that was maybe like I don't know it's like Siri or something that's a very transient less less sensitive to like you know something you don't crash your computer gets stolen computer explodes just like basically transient nothing nothing
 what's the word I'm looking for I don't know that would be sensitive to lose do new things with the thickness of our client is that what the future is going to bring laptop that yesterday like I'm saving files on it I am doing like doing software development and IDE that is code that is on my laptop
 none of that really makes sense especially like given the context of our conversation with guacamole getting really good and like I should just be able to do this on a remote server on Amazon her Google somewhere so as that stuff actually I'm on Skype like why wouldn't I just use Skype in the cloud or something like that as these things shift more to remote usage what are we going to do with the compute power that we have on our desktop reasonable question make the operating system that would run on your ears increasing LinkedIn computer I would I would think if you look at the saying something like Chromebooks and similar appliances it since you've got this thing where instead of dedicating tons of resources to vocally running applications you've you've dedicated resources. To say
 browser with minimal performance needs and and you gain your power efficiency a longevity of battery lightweight simple Hardware I'm not sure that you necessarily going to end up with me and if he's new continually fat laptops and desktops that just don't know what to do it themselves but you probably will end up with better machines that don't have to do as much
 you're on a Chromebook right now
 we tell me some about that experience because it's so strange because Chromebook does seem like the way of the future and yet adoption is so low but why is that right I don't know I'd say it's speaking for myself I mean I've been using this for a while ever ever since Papa's fast enough to be useful on a Chromebook that I switched over to Brooks and eventually migrated away and I don't even have a desktop at home anymore but I'm going to need experience is quite nice Hardware not needing to wait for it to be that's really doesn't but in terms of software being able to just sit down and login to go walk and there's my desktop and then if I go somewhere else so I can log in there and there's my desktop o'clock please I left it or I'll know I need to do it from the train go out my phone it's it's incredibly convenient just be able to sit down anywhere and you something and
 do my to my work whatever happened to be sitting
 so as we're talking about guacamole accessing a cloud-hosted desktop somewhere is there is there a cloud service provider that you prefer to spin up instances at that you're logging into for anybody in particular I can tell you right now you've been using Amazon but how do you stop losing the past I used was it county.net what's the time to a cheap I use Rackspace was really just a matter of what happened to be available at the time lately Amazon seems pretty flexible but I'm not married to it as long as the service is resilient and Stevie and like the same things I've been turned down. It doesn't really matter to me
 sure I haven't done so by now but some have like a freaking to believe the people have done this container such a nice thing to do if you have phone some sort of doctor's appointment to have containers for desktops you don't see why not I think there was some technical reason why that was difficult something having to do with the Privileges and in systemd and not play Morrison's containers but I think they got around that I don't know how easy it is but I know that's possible
 what I mean guacamole obviously has been around for 6 years as we've said his have there been any big accumulations of technical debt
 I wouldn't say so beautiful Captain's brother lean pride ourselves on on the depth of the documentation and the thoroughness of the comments in the code in the cleaners in style so overall I think I'm a pretty good job of maintaining it to the fact that it's actually it's been split up between the individual sleepy eyes and maintain separately and then the components built off of grown men in the components to tie those together you end up these nice independent easy to maintain pieces and then Walt important that you have some level of expertise in what these things do to be able to maintain them properly you know we have a Emmanuel documenting how this works at a high level we have the comments in the code documenting what we intend to do here overall I think
 typical bases pretty healthy
 in this 6 years that guacamole has been around there have been plenty of technological improvements in tools that have come up what are the biggest ones that have come up in the last 6 years that help you build guacamole. You may even once was a relatively new and I I know I only know that at the time the company that I was working for had just recently switch from using an tutu using Maven early editions of guacamole they used and for the switch to be in than Java architecture when we start using to Dayton and then that's been much more convenient more recently single page app works like angularjs and it has been
 the hole in the face right now is this is Raymond Maine coon KS and it's been extremely convenient prior to maybe a year or so ago my time my sense of time I think about all of that. It was fun code in JavaScript driving interface and at the time that seem like fine to me but then we switched over to something like I was just a breath of fresh air is a Major Payne morning all that code but once it was done everything is just better
 can imagine well Mike thanks for coming on the show I think this is been a fantastic conversation I'm really interested in what guacamole day will be used for in the future I'd love to get to know about some I don't know if you heard if you haven't eaten any closing like examples of like crazy uses of guacamole that you've seen people use that you can actually talk about I wish I could tell you some crazy things but it and yes we will wait for the virtual reality
 haptic interaction driven by Apache guacamole to be open source so okay cool I'll talk to you soon

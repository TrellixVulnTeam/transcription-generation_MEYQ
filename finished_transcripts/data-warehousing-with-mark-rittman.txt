Transcription: in the mid-90s data warehousing might have meant using an Oracle database today it means a wide variety things you could be stitching together a big data pipeline using Kafka Hadoop and Spark YouTube using manage tools like big query from Google you could be doing a lot of things how did we get from the simple days of Oracle databases to the wealth of options available today Mark Rittman rights and podcast about data engineering and data warehousing on his site drill to detail today we explore the past present and future of data warehouse and we touch on many of the trends that have been explored in recent episodes of software engineering daily had a great time talking to Mark and I think you're going to enjoy it too

 Mark Rypien is an independent analyst with MJR analytics Mark welcome to software engineer daily and the reason that I want to have you on is as I was telling you before the show that you have been through several cycles of the space that some people might call data warehousing or Big Data you started off with Oracle in the early nineties and you have worked through to the present-day Technologies you've been working with these Technologies Hands-On and you write about the molarity of a podcast will get into that and today we have lots of Apache projects like drill and Spark we've got a huge variety of cloud options and I just want to get your scope because over the past 25 years there's been so many different products we've come so far when you look back over that 25 year. That has been your career in this
 space did you see a Continuum of data products like going from Oracle to the present day where do you see it more in terms of like clear inflection points were you say Okay Hadoop happened in this thing dramatically change in the no sequel happened in to Enterprise the change AWS happened to the right of the change to the Continuum or is it these clear inflection points question Jeff will get one from scratch like some of the kind of bait did the Patriots that been in this area that started my career sorry I thought you back in about looking at you cite a movie called ice Warehouse in so it was a classic i t trip engagement that we we we we got into it I know if it is very very long expensive project where we were tight tights it from the Paris cannabis price of rice or systems customers with use copy into some former tight store design for craving
 and then use a series of toes or use a series of kung fu analysis take techniques on that site so to get some information out and I guess it probably hasn't changed to 25 years has always been this thing is taking copies of diets out and put it in somewhere this more tomorrow isn't designed to storage doing some home tax registration and then kind of craving it and so in the old days it would have been coughing it into I know but I swear house suicide by States Warehouse everything makes a while ago I'm so that means kind of copying part then they paid for and stuff like that I'm preparing it for now Asus so I guess what is this kind of fact that you still owe you a couple of days straight there for craving and and then work on it I guess what is difference is they are supposed to ceremony and say the kind of the it
 open side of it is is Chinese overtime yet back in those days it was a million dollars a month through this whole thing please give me a lot more gas by using my businesses and I guess this lets everybody around a lot of work now as well that you heard if so Concepts lice leave me on read and and kind of thing so we still copying date you into a separate so I guess the ceremony and the process and expense and the Archie cartoon has changed but the difference is really okay well let's go through some of that history and make our way to the present and then we can get it to the Future which will probably be the most exciting part of the conversation why was Hadoop so important to data warehousing if we are looking at things from a inflection in the history of
 Reflections what what what inflections did Hadoop have on the data warehousing space interesting infection Point ready in this couple of characteristics of a dick. I think sometimes it's hard to say sometimes and I guess what is different about this is a true things ready it's the first of all days to die sober house and it's always been this kind of story about we can take copies to put together a cheap been possible today because of the expense such a copy of my house and someone that you can never fall too that come visit her phone today. And then 17 exercising too spicy Thai place which was kind of pacemaker where they did a part where he was that
 and the prices and the spice curation the right now I'm with that types of to put it into side of the ice Warehouse was so involved and so long-winded that never happened that was different about the Petit the kind of thing I do every thought you said you copy of title into that has a plastic example largely in Stacy came from so it's a lot simpler and what shape is like that you insert pasta and it's a lot cheaper as well so you got to school dates her in a class 3 typically you're not a fraction of the cost putting into an orchid ice Warehouse or territories or whatever it's the first of always be possible to actually copy of your day twenty one place to the first time I think that's very interesting about is if you think about it again if you want to say thank you in jeans the storage and the quarians in the storage unit and the Beast
 quit using all Four sequel query engine but then you apply different reactions to it or not Fugees guy so decide to hear the first time it's been a long time was possible to do that and the second base you can apply really any query engine to not die 2 in price and so that's quite a different approach to the warehousing everything was tied together now the other Transit I think about that took off around the same time as Hadoop was AWS I think Hadoop was 2005 or 2006 and 8 of us was basically the same time what what were the ways in which of these two burgeoning areas overlapped and affected the evolution of each other question the two things happened around the same time
 Los omnipotent is a lot of people in there in Industry would have to talk about the same time it's helping save states no shame there's no kind of pissed you would just come in and everything in that is what I tell you whatever I'm done contest Urban Development and over absolutely before before before they're kind of very different. Very different so fine she's so I think about clown puppet mozzarella cheese Cloud Carpet Inn in my company but you're sharing the results so you're coming in that you're renting a fight if you're not interested in the cloud
 percentage of the kind of power power and that you have multiple boxes that you cannot see that inquiries if I have just one thing so, I was almost too kind of date the opposite of so in some aspects of a kind of access all access to lots of different boxes so they're very different situations of headache with liquid kind of pull back into the cloud completely missed the point of what is about because you had you had enough people to play mr. point however I think the two things have become interesting and this is I think I was in what one of the kind of fine if one of the kind of the latest in the spice who's this whole dollastic, provisioning side
 so now most of the vendors that I doing stuff in the Deep spice or cold for this year certainly Amazon you can move computer into account that is elastic is or obstructed wiring someone so now I think that I do and cloud in extremely late and it's the point where I'm ready in a dice warehousing I do no sequel or they sings the actual kind of mechanism that I think it's cloudy but we talked about the Furious time not to do I did was be won in total mechanism Smite used to store the process died so they sold as effectively 1-1 elastic be proficient Cloud compute and a storage results that's my favorite

 when we're still talking about the earlier days and Cloud it's easy to talk about Cloudera which was started to vend Hadoop basically because he was really hard to set up in the early days and it's really wanted it with good reason but it was like let's take some of its like the IBM model pressure gets a lot of company model at that point in have a bunch of Consultants that you can drop in and you have specific technology that that you can vend and I think Cloudera did a really great job of accelerating the adoption of Hadoop what was the impact of Cloudera from your point of view and how did large Enterprises adopt Hadoop around that time yeah interesting so so I'd say no more
 interesting you compared them to it so I'll be able to send one to me so I can set him back a little bit that you mentioned that a lot of people who understand I do but not producing someone but clothes are fitting in in downloading episodes project then trying to not the bar kind of changing my producing job when someone on and that everyone to be nothing more than a reminder we completely of provisional Tyson Lennox so I thought I told you I like where and I'm a non-ferrous conversion survive Epic on Linux and you know you revive my house isn't as soon as a kind of CDs or or or floppy disks or you download Linux Linux distribution from from you have from the Apache sign this whole thing I knew it I knew it kind of compile you and cuddle I knew it I knew it
 search so really what kind of down the hill I used that popularized the next was right I was serious I was open to in time and so on so I see I never really was only one kind of like commercial sisters out that was red hot see how old was supposed so they would support kind of like lyrics. Time and so can I get alongside homeworks Chick-fil-A were the two companies that would just like kind of into my mind there like Souza and I'm kind of Red Hots in a while so I might kind of like between is it typically doesn't my cat lay down I was dating typically the kind of follow is and how did the now you know where I've been sober I can see anybody else kind of thing so you were so gay
 Adventist lights at Manpower in soanish I can quite kind of commercial approach to get that really got you a question I walked is Cloudera putting Cloudera effectively kind of connection seem like it possible to download on what we decide on what we did in the office and someone that they wrap too kind of support contract but I hope so too they were lost as well and I had squash you didn't with can I do with my time and in some respects my call cuz they stay suddenly there's something you wear that there's a kind of like this is going to be out there so I think I might have an accessible to people who didn't want to come to be downloading discs and someone else is interested you said about they would suggest clouds but I'm not sure what the future is going to be in the clouds really interesting like a little bit later on
 the really exciting areas to unpack but to give us more of a foundation more of his little bit more of a historical foundation around this time that were touching on its Cloud error early Hadoop days there were these things like hbase And Hive and ecosystem started to develop and then there were things like storm and storm start to get popular I think I think I remember hearing in your podcast up the drill drill to detail right that's the name of the podcast yes so I think I remember hearing that problem in that parking either it was you or the guest who said that storm was in some ways sure before its time and I just give us a picture for when did we start to get from the days where we were just doing kind of batch Hadoop stuff and we were looking at better ways of doing
 do the more modern systems like storm while to storm like you said maybe that's before its time maybe systems like spark with the systems were you get more of a real-time processing think how did we make that jump is a community from the batch to the more streaming World text that it was the it was the podcast episode of a coated with Alex Olivia if I keep it pushin from from doing a cheap flights to Canal yet for Cecilia how big is 100000 events per second time someone how do we get from batch 2 tutorial time well if you think about early I use cases
 for several ways are typically working as a as a real-time system so you be kind of TV streaming in the West Ashley streamy entice into into Simon produce you would then processing that real time travel time to spectate but the question was how could be a fight to become a process that day too so we can land it in real time that using liezel Flume on using it in time and so that's been a problem that has been trying to sell for a long time really and I can't find the title page warehouse and do that is always been the hardest thing you can actually I will time is the hardest thing to get to and I guess if you if you come to pick up the point at which to my my way
 travel time in the Navy you get to kind of lifestyle that is where you know how old school dates warehousing at old school but I should like spicy sweet that's additional kind of like I got to go back segments and unkind of Lightyear transaction to pull in that silver thing they can't do without so where we are now he's almost every system. Now I would be able to be involved in pure power is because we want to have a response things quickly obvious because we don't deal with email time you never going to guess you could have happened to understand what's going on but things like storm there's been a lot of Despair look kind of desperate attempts to solve this problem. You know because of fetty WAP come along this come along is that sleeping he's been so so busy this example that there's nothing wrong with example
 and then because the night shift open source technology that there is no kind of central pan this controller will this there's no sexual kind of planning they single what happened to stolen for a while we can do this better comes along it just gets companies use an example that we talked about in the podcast was moved to connect to Cloud dataflow they move to pops up and someone it's just because because there is no license in breast milk at night because there is no real kind of like you know who sunk cost in guy down this road it smells comes on this bad that you can just use that I'm not contrast massively with movo to say Oracle where you might spend a billion dollars on on the alarm since its attachments Croatian to spice and saw one at a time when I think it's only problem with now you spend all this money and you try that paper that kind of stuff that you can't shift from it so it's not always easy as long as interesting in that you can just add up to everything you this coming on but it does mean you could be as well
 got back so maybe the toddler fuel pump cost price and need now to be a software engineer technology love them perhaps point-and-click people used to be working with Clay Basket toast spices although as we get to the conversation on Google it does seem like Google is try to at least make it an option to work with then a high-level dashboard like environment where you can be a point-and-click data scientist or data engineer because of like you said going towards a cloud computing model where you're not thinking of things in terms of Hadoop perhaps this is the serverless discussion we're going to do nothing you turn servers nothing in terms of logging into a console you're just on a you want to take a dashboard on it through a web browser and you're doing all your data warehousing operations through that
 well yes or no it's not me that this type of two things I said Festival in the second yes you've got a big query wish you take your tights y Olaf the complexity of a managing things up volpak segments and managing things like backups and insist you need all that kind of stuff used to it was detective wiota work you should do in terms of Dayton Mall play and and watching eat your retainers and so on that but Google Cloud platform in particular easier once you get into using things not pops up or the account thanks flight it's closing you know what the code in you do is not that difficult. But I different to each of us Xbox achievements I want stuff like that in to do an end to an end and casca configuration laws and how did it but I would say that I didn't dividual developer is a lot more productive than I used to be
 Mercedes skills required it's it's I think I think of your out punch people left behind this way to remove a point and click in and doing things all that. That is not the way he had the name is not equivalent of a ninja mask for example that you would use with Google Cloud platform now where imma send gets interest stations prices you can use with me it's kind of hectic but the cost of values East is massive compared to what used to be mine so you know how to use you can stop by the way you toes like I would rely on this masquerade license yeah you told me like a million dollars for you do anything where they at and said that he's just ridiculous and weld the way it gets interesting in the Amazon Wells he's that you thought you must have had you adequate time is in glue is in using this coming along which is about kind of magic introspection your kind of solar systems mapping out
 Target clamp varmint what kind of states are transformation retaining to make sounds like it if your fuel pump is his sister into writing you gotta shoot yourself because you hate sounds it sounds that because your mouth will they work that's interesting but then when I was in I was in as a different approach to how you do kind of like I suppose Tyson unless it's on that platform so they have I hope everything I miss at all I'm going to say now you got all these different kind of things that and so much but again you doing as well so you were away and things that businesses to make the things. Compliments of that is cheap as possible and then but you put your own
 skills you have to have to understand that you have which of these which of these various different computer engine sweetie I'll be a baby distraction in public gets these technology if it comes to it sounds like it's too late does the work of detail Department in in one toe interesting you there I think in the analogy between maybe you didn't mean it this way with the analogy between the Alexa or the Amazon Echo ecosystem and the AWS ecosystem where it's this it's almost defies any previous analogy because it's not exactly an open environment it's not exactly a closed environment it's like just this environment where
 where Amazon provides a world that is very easy to play in very fun to play in but it's not it's not completely open at least that's my understanding of the Amazon skills like it's very easy to write Alexis skills and then your integrated with Google over earlier than your integrate with with Amazon and and it sounds like the blue but perhaps is similar to that where it's at it makes the integral I don't know what can you describe that glue thing in more detail cuz I don't quite understand what you were talking about their volume Five dogs into Echoes In The House kind of Google home and everything else see how easy this is ridiculous yeah that sucks is I'm playing to at Technologies you can imagine and abstract
 text you about certain things but it also kind of controls on unconstrained I'm up to about yo facts about your pod cost to publish a loan that I provided will cook 2 or 3 days from now okay so there's no kind of the Android app in the Android play place inside the IRS App Store where can I find a whole bunch of things out that where is it's like a it's like it's over like a bricks that you've done there's no particular particular kind of building
 trust for Amazon the retail store so I was in the retail store is east east the primary and first customer fell out these things but there's no particular building it for Amazon you said there might be a viable like sunlight so there's no particular kind of planning that I think about you that was planning cuz they don't see that there's no vomiting on the cloud and someone so punch your services out there hopefully in the retail store is probably the kind of primary customer who is we Google and I would say she could go outside at technology say build around big geyser built first and foremost it was on you since I lay so you're not big query was Irish and laid right now actually that travel website so too big for it was really Dremel that was in Total Service Google is now We Made It by Black Stone uses fantastic as you can fit you bringing the Entire Computer
 box in a test know how you want to do it well then you can decide because you have any way you can do it I'm so in some respects that's good because you know what you doing you're the one that someone is much more than just you got to enjoy yourself you want to do with these really we're not going to have any control over it was just going to say his dipi is his devices and someone that you got into it and I don't know which is the best way to know is that I think that that is when does the aunt as good as Google consumer icing This I Know song as good as I'm an emotional I seen this point is going to bite it's also an opportunistic think because Amazon was first to Market so they've been letting a flowers oppa thousand flowers bloom for a while now and they've got all kinds of customers on all kinds of different
 it's not like they can roll back and say this is the way that we're going to do things where is Google has in substance of last mover Advantage even though they probably didn't plant in fact I know they didn't plan it this way they didn't realize how big clouds going to be in there became really big arguably they work for Google was earlier to market with the app engine and the app engine did things too opinionated the Lee and then so Amazon moved in with the less opinionated approach had massive success and then now the Google opinionated proach almost makes makes an equal amount of sense at this point because of Google has been watching someone from the sidelines and saying well you know this thing might make the most sense this thing might make the most sense you know they can say things like pee look we've been managing our data centers for a long time with essentially kubernetes with the internal version of kubernetes was bored and they can say kubernetes is the way that you want to do it if you want to be on the Google platform it and you want a man
 infrastructure this is the way to do it with machine learning they can say this is the way to do it this how we do it internally were externalizing the service this is the way to do it and do it is this interesting contrast in in how the the different company said we have evolve and you can play any their environment it is almost it's funny because in this in this is for dry me iOS versus Android analogy Google is the iOS approach in this in that an analog It Isn't So I think Google is a kind of ioi very good cuz she become happy to see company I think Sonny needs to be is interesting I think that there's not been received and I'm kind of in a I think the way that I deal with a customer is it going to be today by system shutting off use repeat a big customer
 I just tried to take the Titanic when it went wrong because I have to contact but I think that I think Google saving Graces is there in Geneva this is fantastic right time and well I generally develop in income Google Google Cloud platform now and I use at home to stuff I do with all my stuff before I think that if you were vendor. He's trying to be more descriptive how you do things but your engineering isn't as good let's type of sample Oracle is example that all that smack URL Charlie Moore modular and trying to say what I see and I would like silent thousand flowers bloom but you're not as good at doing that or you have something like you know as your hair or stuff like that then it's interesting to try to Sentosa Jaan a sample what is your what is your kind of a pill that way like you either going to be
 African baby died where is where is he now where is maybe so Google is the Apple Edition rock at this kind of. And so you made your choice ready which one you got with what state is Microsoft in terms of being apart from play oh you know it's kind of cold or no it's kind of pretty good experience as a couple blocks I be used to be a weather then where you going to be I got to ask you about the Google home vs Alexa or Amazon Echo experience this is totally unrelated to data warehousing but I think anybody listening to this podcast will be interested in your thoughts I mean I have a Google home I tried out Amazon Echo before I saw Google home and now it's then I returned it because I figured Google home would do a better job and I think something I realize is that I miss aspects about the echo but I still love the Google home and I kind of want to get Alexa again I found one I have both of them just because these things are for people who are listening if you have a software
 salary and you haven't gotten one of these devices you should get it because they're just incredible but I really want to ask you is what have you learned from having both of them what are the query types that Google is really good and what it was Amazon particularly good at this is Uncle Lee sings now and the house now cuz so I don't have spent all that money on Amazing every time I nothing to Google how it looks like an air freshener for a couple of weeks before the kids come to realize what it was. I'm in and then I saw the video on YouTube where you can get the Google home just wait to the next and the next and it's kind of late so they found out and I thought it was hilarious I was supposed to do that point when that happened site so Alexa Alexa is not the window inside Windows 98
 oh that's mine in San Francisco watch me that's the way that's funny actually I was thinking if I was her the thing with the Alexa is the he's got all that they sell easy trade skills so if you if you want to speak with this guy he's kind of home devices guarantee they'll be any device name with the with the election if not you can wash yourself and I'm on my inspiration to myself that my to control various things in and so on I think the Google home one is kind of is better understanding language so I think we're Alexa is like a very limited vocabulary and you have to be careful what you say
 so is Freddie Coleman in our house cuz he likes it says about so has about 30 Hue Lights in the house so it kind of keeps getting as well which one you talking about meeting rooms in San Juan who is Google how is a lot better understanding the intended what you're saying and someone I'm OK Google how to make it better for is things are going to Google search so you know if you say OK Google what's the capital of kind of China whether it would give you an ounce at where is Alexa doesn't do that really so possibly is interesting me the Google home is almost got me to the point of swapping it to using the pixel Google assistant is so good it's a crap I would say that it is enough of a thing the tips you over so everything y'all going back up on my phone or what kind of stopping Siri is a joke in this area
 which way do you cite your phone switch on my calendar understands you say to your iMac say that is designed the statue you so very much that was so good I understand what you're trying to say Omar City self chippy average Taconic Google weld from someone who is so awful kind of like you have been through getting sick of all sorry it's it's excited it's better but this morning to discuss this moment equations with the with the Alexa

 especially if you're an Amazon power user New Order all these stuff from Amazon they the ease of ordering is great but anyway I don't want the listeners to accuse me of being at Gadget podcast so is there so many let's talk about machine learning because yes this this machine learning in 2017 seems to be pushing up I mean if there's a Bellwether for where cortical data warehousing is going to go it's it's like a death of the problems of machine learning and
 think there is this this weird show about the pancake stack I should say as weird as this is where people are going with the pancake stack is basically how do you get online machine learning basically how do you get to the point where a single training example can easily propagate through and add to your machine learning model whereas in current-day a lot of systems are just batch-processing up a bunch of training samples can you get you wait until you got like you know 50,000 training examples and then you do your nightly batch processing job with machine learning I guess in your travels this am I accurately portraying the way that like is this one of the canonical problems you see in machine learning and I guess more broadly how is machine learning affecting the data warehousing space
 size of a sewing machine learning is got it but he's just shorted out every kind of like every Climb Racing or every kind of development it was test-driven development it was it was snaps machine learning before it was kind of a memory confusion song were they seem to actually fantastic and and my career has been built off of 30 things that customers can a one and an antique car in the fantastic and I will be out but the machine learning is into every every conversation you have off your building products you say I just got machine learning it's I want and come on we are on our way over now is that. Actually if it is I'll just start so it could be things are linear regression
 we could babysit thing you put in that and it would have been if we are all 8 States it's massively building the same letting stuff out I don't know why I'm at the coal face is doing this and I know it work with at least six of Housing and you know that machine learning is Matt, I try not to think about that she might end up losing out platform. He's going to do is look at these on I'm working a huge amount so I can see what they say it comes in Lake Street website since I want to text now hundred thousand to Ben said we kind of second cousin says message to like I'm on the head line is we do machine learning on this on this platform but but it's it's it's one swoop heart of every month and so which one to do things like you know maybe things off predictive model
 attached that sewing machine learning linear regression that's all the time you know if we talked about doing things like someone that passed off as well but actually there's a much bigger picture there about how do we how do we solve my predict forward how do we kind of muzzle things like time different approaches you could take in the NFL product launch in and someone that I mean I think that's very kind of travel things coming along with that but it's never going to like it's like a very lucky idiot that your time with reading some respects and that is very good at telling you this is my opportunity is this is where we think things might go it has no idea of the time of kind of why the outcome was kind of my prediction is it seems like a very lucky friend who's got no idea why it keeps going to voting stop music
 but let's face it he had no idea why he was a success I'm sorry to say. And that's one thing and sometimes it's good but it's not it's not a kind of a silver bullet for everything really absolutely but if you get a deep Learning System then you can just configure it such that you throw more and more data at it and your friend gets lucky or luckier as time goes on in that is in some ways quite promising because it's alright we don't have to I mean we will billboard sophisticated systems we will get the Deep Learning Systems to be more sophisticated but it is this nice Trend that we can see that it's going to be we ask for some. Into the future of progress in terms of where as long as we can feed the date of monster
 it's going to get bigger and hungry or more helpful and my question to you is so where does that leave the data warehousing systems that we have today do they need to change or are they already Well Suited enough to serve this future that were careening towards what will is a I think I think it's like it's like a friend of yours the best see how to keep an eye on the couch like having it in the trees all the time he can count the cause that guy inside and out at some point they say they're going to be found out we will be a billionaire you know but he's never going to end up buying the casino and I think it a y e dice warehousing that he's taking a step back and sign right we've got this report this kind of scam going on we got this thing I know my weak apricots and we can we can we can throw this at 36 season
 by the way what time do I housing it signed well how did we get it how do you work out in the first place that we should be done at this casino we should we should have we should have this idea okay so Skype me I wish the casinos to go for that's kind of where you're very kind of woman Mac Pro level why can't we wish the casinos almost the kind of guy and should be focusing on I don't so yeah I will wear this is what had to be reinvested discount card counting you know 666 is voting thing too kind of Lights set to maybe buy one casino and then band called counting and then band kind of like in our crops and stuff that's what I'm saying nothing is good it's like app is focusing on a particular area and it's really kind of got department has to do this efficiently and it's learning and one thing only and I think that's where housing and the to suck the discipline of gathering dice together I might meet us get when you dream machine learning on huge amounts of what's going on before 8
 analysis to structure it to to get rid of Outlaws to work out is this the right they decide to look at and so on and so I think things that machine learning and I swear housing and Analysis and forecasting someone that will be all things going forward it's not some kind of old person sings I need cause they see. Because reaping nostalgic the sign there is more to analytics more data analysis to just one thing up machine learning example that way I could get interesting he's as vendors like Siam is in a casino I said all this and make it so it's a service that is obstructed the white was he will be gone it's over the counter it's all the work involved in the kind of the infrastructure on all the work involved in in in some of the tasks also mind-blowingly kind of in a box I got in there in just putting putting colored lines on on incoming calls files coming your way you could easily just what it out from doing some classification retainer
 yeah there's a huge amounts of what that will. Why you thought just things that are just should be easier to my boss think that there's a Volvo different types of analysis go forward I'm sure he's one of those things is having said that we could end up being I was going in tomorrow to take care of the world in an empty now 18 so whoever but I think that there's more to it than just the Apache project was the earliest of the Big Data Apache project but now there's just like so many I've done some shows recently on Apache Trail Apache Arrow Apache Apache project open source projects that seem exciting to you right now interesting so it's on the side that we could just kind of I mention someone that doesn't exist
 pump it up and put it up because that's the kind of update of the playlist this is a project that is about secret sister had to die separately so bad so you know I like to find the skateboard Define the kind of date the table stretches and so on yeah drill will look at the inbuilt message I sent with inside Hawkeye follow each other every follower ever chicks really interest me because it just again changes the game in terms of how you do exploratory and time what's the time zone befor in Jackson stood Aisa transit to find item lets you just saw analyzing it and exploring it and will explode
 connect things like your hive Hive metastore you connect about your files you can catch Oracle for example and do stuff with that interested me is well you mentioned our second ago because it's kind of in Hawaii you know think about the in memory kind of used to this in your memory structures Marie pasta to each other and someone said I seem too interested interesting take on that question is as we now move more tools the clouds I think it's like me it's like we talked about which of the most interesting open source project episodes project anymore cuz I tend to Walk in the Clouds when you're working with side pops up or you're working with the conversion of cash, but it's is designed to go when you're welcome account that apply which is Apache famous poses and open source project but the more you get into these kind of services in the clouds on fire to the less you're talking about
 and so I don't know it's interesting to think about it why would it be would it be available in conversation happen if you use time is that she would we talk about the services we get the bill off of 3288 the building in that elastic compute. Kodiak Alaska earthquake Memphis around it so I want the video with of the ultimate authority of all this kind of stuff going on is the oldest that he's older these type of source project the engineering department for Arkansas one no game pay for it I don't do all the other why they sings All exposed out is a services that that that that charge money for that that would be the option to use this world homework so I can take a shower house saying we got these practices projects we just kind of distribution you know I can say that will be talking less about these things and more about the services
 the body by those big cow been dissed I know he took my husband so Seymour which is interesting okay well on that note let's talk a little bit about Google and particularly big to wrap things up cuz you wrote an article about big query recently I'll learn Spanish show notes when I look at big great I really get the feeling that they are there I guess I already said this is doing the same thing that they're doing with each other systems like tensorflow and kubernetes where they're making a managed version of make a really high level of management and its really easy to work with which as you just mentioned is probably what we're going to be increasingly using as time goes on and I think that's great because I think developers get a lot more leverage from that point if you would like just use utilizing his many Cloud resources as you can these high-level AP eyes are getting Cheaper by the minute so
 I guess explain to people what bigquery is and what is symbolic of for Google's bigger strategy of the cloud icon but suddenly to be creamy is the definition of it is I Cloud knighted columnstore distributed computing query engine so yeah big table and every time I just hope apple juice and some one last time I bought this is way different in that you load data into you like a train to be query it goes in in the fort I will start similar to things like to do for example that from you have from the Apache project where you can you load it these type of the soap stores you typically loaded and I'm sorry it said having
 mentioned I was in fact tables and joins nuts or thing you should be loaded in a t no lies full blast quiet impact on how we draw Alex and joins and so on it's it's columnar so sad when you're ready retrieve to call him that you're interested come as you interested in a memory to external memory I think is well and it's pretty fast so to query in a pizza is quickest craving yeah I think about in this whole thing I think they kind of interesting facts on it is that you you don't think about the base molding time so you don't go in there and Kathleen Define you know anybody find things as being strangled wind chill whatever but beyond that is it's coming out there you just load it and go as it is it typically it's it's it's a pain. William you cannot see update things that someone but it it just get away it would move so much of the talks and I swear housing that you used to think we just essential and things you just have to always do things at face mostly
 instituting a lot so we'll thing there's no index is so you know you'll be tree index is not so I think that's what kind of gone so it's just really fast and Anna still there still a need to my mind to do things not creepy creepy I hope it's how you do joint when you didn't study them is interesting is so much of what we used to spend so much time on before is it is now kind of think about and it's Google's kind of strategy I don't know it's interesting I mean what does cheese around around big guy trying to text on the Google platform is is is calendar days will be beside Amazon example really pretty I mean
 it's hard to shop for what the strategy is taking these things for depart from the site Harris technology Google interesting if you want well you know he loves you guys somewhere else but if it is then if you build things inside my that we building Google then you'll do very well at an inside-out spot test strategies Falls I can say it really okay Mark well I think we made it through a pretty decent chronology of data warehousing and particulate moving towards a cloud I want thank you for coming on software engineering daily and anybody who is interested in Topix similar to what we've covered I recommend the drill to detail podcast I enjoyed listening to a prayer for the show and I subscribe to it so thanks for coming on Mark thanks Jeff thanks hope to speak to you

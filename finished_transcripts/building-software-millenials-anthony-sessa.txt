Transcription: successful news organizations today are putting technology first software tools give journalist more leverage journalists can share information and publish faster with fewer errors data scientist give new stories statistical support software engineering is at the core of the most successful media Outlets mic.com is a media company focused on news for Millennials Anthony Sessa is the VP of product at mic.com and he joins us to talk about the engineering of a modern news organization we discussed data engineering front-end Technologies and how to migrate away from WordPress we also explore how to build a successful media company today and how Millennials like myself want to consume news if you're a fan of software engineering daily we want to know how to improve please take 5 minutes to fill out our listeners survey is a link to the survey in our newsletter and on our website we would love to know what you think what you want
you're more of and less of a we read all the feedback we get so please go to software engineering daily.com and fill out the survey it would really help us after a quick word from a sponsor we will get to this episode software engineering in a modern Newsroom with Anthony Sessa thanks for listening
 as a software engineer you have tremendous leverage in the employment Market every company need software engineers and these companies are all competing for you the engineer a scarce resource but as an individual engineer you don't have much insight into this incredibly opaque Market that's where hired.com comes in her.com assigned you a talent Advocate who works to understand your needs and works to find you the perfect job go to hired.com se daily to try out the platform today and get a $2,000 bonus if you find a job the companies on hired compete for you the engineer and then make bids to win your talent these are companies like Facebook and Uber companies that we know are on The Cutting Edge of engineering because they've come on software engineering daily to talk about their Tech stack
 I have used hired personally and I've experienced firsthand the ease of finding a well-paid enjoyable job this was way better than replying to LinkedIn messages from uninformed recruiters and is also certainly better than using a job search engine to find a great job and support software engineering daily go to hired.com se daily and get a $2,000 bonus up on finding a job check it out it would support the show now let's get on with the show
 Anthony Sessa is the VP of product at mic.com a media company focused on news for Millennials Anthony welcome to software engineering daily
 hey thanks for having me so what is mic.com
 and a quick snapshot to new site for college-educated Millennials so we have 30 million unique visitors around 80% of them are college-educated and we're riding news for them that is conversational on topic and takes a stance in some cases on some pretty pretty big issues which can be along the lines of lgbtq social justice women's rights and we're trying that kind of credit conversational tone around these topics does Mike think of itself as a technology organization
 so it's it's an interesting question because we definitely think of ourselves as a tech organization and it's one of the the fun aspect of the culture here but even more so than tack we think of our team as a product organization and it's kind of a thesis of of hours and I I join three years ago as an engineer when there is nine people and I are like 130 and essentially my my reason for coming here is is I really love product that I was an engineer myself and I always wanted the product engineering team to be one so even though we're very technically enabled a inclined there's a very product minded people that are Engineers here and that are very much associated with the entire process of building products so yeah I had a similar view to the technical technological fueled New York media companies the other the other technological field New York media companies like BuzzFeed or the
 you like the New York Times is becoming more technologically informed how do you think the the focus on product and Technology at Mike compares to that of of New York Times Are BuzzFeed I mean these are much larger media companies that are really good at what they do especially those two companies I mean the New York Times since renovation report has made a drastic change and how they view digital media space in BuzzFeed has always been excellent at this and here we have a similar but kind of different challenge it's a little more Niche essentially where were dealing with a specific demo or specific kind of group of people and given how important the consumer-facing product that we have our we're always taking that into consideration so right now we can have a mobile website a desktop website we do treat them as separate products on the majority of our traffics on mobile so only think of the challenges that we have it's it's always about mobile web
 how we can make that product better how can we get a right on that product what kind of data do we need behind the scenes and make better decisions and then be on that and I think you could all these organizations like the bigger ones have their own cms's at this plan from kind of two years ago we already started building the majority of our stuff in the house and the CMS being one of them the article out of there being one of them I'd love to show you at some point can't do it over a podcast obviously it's very much in line with our article page looks and allows editorial team note to see the content that are producing live and it's very media mask in nature and it back by analytics every article Pages analytics on it so I think this kind of mental workflow of allowing editorial quality along with data-driven journalism and data-driven kind of design and product ization is something we do fairly well and really well in most cases and a lot of these other companies like New York Times and BuzzFeed are also doing it too so I totally
 can appreciate the importance of having a home-brewed CMS software engineering daily this podcast runs on WordPress and WordPress is great at what it does and there are many Fantastic media organizations out there that are running on WordPress and have a extremely modularized custom-built home-brewed WordPress but you can always feel when you go to a WordPress site you know it's WordPress what are the technological problems with WordPress where is WordPress splitting at the seams and why could you not build mic.com on WordPress
 I Saw IV what's interesting about this question is I've had I can't name names people that other media companies, and say how do I convince them not to use WordPress and smaller Publications it makes perfect sense you have everything you could possibly need and it gets out of the box now what when I kind of answer this question it's a little bit not just technically inclined but it's almost like technical organizationally it becomes problematic so from day one from a CMS workflow perspective you're locked into the design you're locked into the usability you're locked into a my sequel database you have to use PHP you can start with themes but then you probably want something that's customize so then you're going to have to go out and find someone who's a specialist and how the whole theme infrastructure works the the famous WordPress loop I don't know if they've changed it or not since I've last played with it I'm sure it's a lot better than I used to go what is the WordPress Loop so there's a loop function this is older so may not exist anymore but there's this Loop
 we're pressed specifically on the posts page where you list your post essentially and it goes through this basically long procedural function called Loop essentially that will build a header build the content build the the permalink structure bring the comments in so you have to kind of tap into this Loop and you know I'm going off of memory of five six years ago but it so it was kind of a sting this this concept and then you can just go back till you have to hire people that do WordPress and I don't want to speak down to them but in any case the more the more aggressive software Engineers I would say are going after more the custom problems that they have to solve so when you get worked into a PHP infrastructure that is somewhere outside of the norm of General best practices of PHP open I mean object-oriented programming it gets a little bit harder to find people that want to deal with that problem
 Facebook unless you create your own do you know way of dealing with that problem so yeah and it's just a very becomes very specialized mindset for engineer's okay so let me ask you Inn in my own self-interest because eventually ideally software engineering daily will move off of Wordpress to what degree is WordPress like a walled-garden I mean you did mention there are in a circus train see how difficult would it be to migrate everything off of Wordpress and onto a different platform depends what the platform is if you're going to another
 blog based pre-made application you probably can import it fairly well because it's there so many important export tools for WordPress what I would suggest regardless of what platform you choose and this is what group was done when it when they migrated to Drupal 8 or whatever it was they did they create an underlying MVC framework so if you want something other developers gotta understand that can create a long-lasting platform from a software engineering perspective an architectural perspective you're going to want to move to the very least to an MVC architecture so I don't know if the top of my head what blogging platforms utilize that besides Drupal and a certain sense but there are definitely
 scaffolded platforms out there for creating blogs and at the end of the day with a blog is a simple crud you're going to create a row you're going to update you know read the road I didn't delete it and that problems not a very difficult on the Saab and that's what NBC Frameworks like rails or zendure cakephp or even express a little bit and node very easily so perhaps the lock-in might exist at the level of plugins it depends I'm trying to think like if you want to have sophisticated image crappie on the backend and custom modules yeah you going to build a from scratch okay I'm sure they're changing and how the technology in these organizations is changing but starting from the top down there was just booked a while ago by Eric Schmidt the former Google CEO
 Google after stepping down as CEO and he can start writing some books and one is called the new digital age and one of the things that he predicts in this book is that the importance of bigger centralized news organizations will go down over time and be replaced by not fully replace but largely replaced by a higher population of these tighter more vertical lized news outlets is that coming true I would definitely think in some senses yes saying replace is a little bit strong but they're going to be challenged by them so obviously Mike is a very focused news publication or media media company and then you have all the other ones out there Court which is very business Centric medium which is still in the same space but more of a product first consumer product person anything else which is super interesting and then you have the big guys like the New York Times which I mentioned before I mean that Innovation report that they released was I thought great
 it showed and paid the foundation for the older media companies and how they can start thinking about moving into this new world to the companies that are kind of what what's the word taking on that challenge I think we're going to stay they really are the ones that aren't moving as fast as they need to and really putting Tekken product first and data first and making sure that adores are informed on a daily basis about how their articles are being distributed how well they're doing an addition muted sense and how they can write high quality journalism at the same time while worrying about how many eyes are going to see their news that's a really interesting challenge that companies like my courts box BuzzFeed obviously are all doing on a daily daily basis and yeah I think some of the old companies are going to loose and some of the New Media companies that are trying to do this are going to lose as well but then you're going to have an ice Core group that make it like Mike and BuzzFeed inbox it so forth
 landscape are these driven by the technological advances that enable certain people to be more powerful so that they don't need a lot of the infrastructure of the giant model of the New York Times or is it is it more due to changing preferences like for example you know I feel like Millennials don't care as much about facts checking you know they're kind of okay with a shoot-first-ask-questions-later form of media you know the the append only eventual consistency form of me. So I don't know what is it what is the what is driving this this series of changes
 so I'm I'm going to speak about Mike I think specifically cuz that's the most knowledge that I have from the editorial perspective but again I've been here very pretty long time and every decision that we made about editorial integrity and fact-checking and everything along those lines has been in a way that puts us in a position to be higher quality lower particles per day more than being a consent form so we're not a Content Farm there's definitely companies that are content Farms we have no desire to ever go in that direction and we made very amazing hires I think from Miley Corsica who is executive ended editor of NPR now she's executive editor here we just hired Quarry hike from Washington Post who was the director of editorial emerging editorial products and we're focusing on how to write the best content we can at the scale that a digital media company has the right of that so
 it is a very very tough Challenge and I mean that's really what it comes down to I think anyone can write 300 articles per day and forget about all that at Oriole Integrity that would be a failure for us if we started doing that and everyone knows that and that's why we we have the kind of culture that we have where people are obsessed about being journalists I mean that's really what it comes down to it sounds like what you're saying is maybe when these you know when when when the media started getting engulfed by Tech you know I don't know the last 5 or 10 years ago at and the kind of a knee-jerk response of how people were hacking Facebook kind of hacking Facebook with just like spamming tons and tons and tons of Articles and they kind of were doing that sometimes under the pretense that this is just the way that we have to do it now and maybe you're suggesting is that
 that is a false trade-off you actually don't need to win that way I don't I mean given we have a large amount of users and we're not doing that and we're going about our distribution in a very sophisticated way it's not I don't think it's necessary and I mean that being said I I kind of didn't address the first part of your question I wouldn't say that Tech and drives media companies as much as I would like to do say that as a technical person content the content does that is the bottom line I'm great contents going to win and we are here the product team is here to allow people to create great content but also give them the information so editors have a lot of access to dashboards in and reporting that we're giving them an end there's people to help them interpret in a way that's journalistically sound so they can make decisions about quality first quantity later and we're working internally very hard on a metric that combines Quality Inn
 that it is is going to be more meaningful to an editor in a rider in the sense where they're not just looking at how many Impressions an article gets her how many shares nautical gets by Dede long-lasting effect that an article has on a reader whether it's integrating time spent how much of the article is red a qualitative survey which is something if you get lucky you might see it on their site right now and those are types of things that were starting to gather and we're starting to work with data scientists understanding how that could actually Coleman a two and a metric that is not so dense but understandable and and people feel good about when their article gets this number in this metric and I are not going to go to the details with him I look like but it is something that I think other media companies are definitely working on in their own way and
 that's where you kind of C-TEC affecting how editors and writers and the journalistic area work and that that's a good example teams within Mike interoperate and how you how you produce such high quality products so you got designers developers Engineers devops I imagine you know I was in the journalist how did these different teams aligned or are there team you just have loosey-goosey people running around how does it work no we don't have to get to be so the product team is
 every engineer at the company's on the product Team every designer product designers on the product team so there is 7/8 engineer's not including myself there's three designers and there's two product managers so all of us work together there's sometimes groups at 3 so you have a dub p.m. at designer and an engineer working on a particular problem that problem is very much aligned with a business goal so at the very top of Mike we have okay are is objectives and key results in those bubble down into each team so one of ours might be grow to this number in traffic and do it across multiple distribution channels and we have to sit down with that at Oriole team who has analytics members on their team and figure out okay
 how and why and when and where do we start doing these kinds of initiatives here is what we have in terms of our resources here. We can solve these problems we can build products we can gather information let's sit together and prioritizes the set of deliverables that we think are going to work and then we go out of her a quarter as fast and as hard and as high quality as we can I am only hiring for the vast majority of engineering hires very product minded engineer's I have Engineers who are telling me that we need to fix this in the process and we need to be more involved in InDesign discussions and we need to be doing more prototyping and we do it and it's a very nice problem to have. Engineers you care so deeply about being affecting the product on a day-to-day basis and I'm lucky I'm lucky that I was able to find these people that being said we do have people that are focusing only on data and they're only working with the product manager to to solve those problems and maybe an architect of some sort
 to do that and that's a little bit different of an issue but it's still heavily integrated into some kind of product that we have weather its content or a product product you know design product so that that kind of shows the structure of Engineering in the product and design teams and we like to not feel like a service organization to Mike but more like a real product team that's going to have our endeavors that are going to address all the business school so without a toriel a lot of the there's a lot of media companies out there that the product teams are servicing out of Tori on what I've seen it happen is you are now building lots of tools and lots of nice features that are going to be great for workflow and make nice flashing editorial content driven products but you're now going to not address the sales needs or you're not going to trust analytics needs as much as you can
 especially because I'm only a 15-person team so we have to be very focused on which goals were heading especially at this size so delivering ads pretty big goal making sure that we have the right analytics infrastructure exceptionally Big Goal making sure that our article editor does not bugs pretty good making sure that we have all the bells and whistles that you possibly could have in our CMS at some point I would love from a from a personal interest perspective to address that but everyone on the team knows that we have to go after these high impact pulse really I mean for lack of a better phrase & Buster my in packs are we all think you're constantly prioritizing maybe there is there's a notion that okay are like the objectives in key results this metrics-driven
 organization style you know what gets measured gets managed this type of style where you wear numbers are important goals are important metrics are important I think that there is perhaps a misunderstanding in some people's minds that this is anathema to a free-flowing creative productive process and that it can and maybe strangle creativity because you know you're just thinking from this numerical cold perspective did we serve enough ads did we did we get enough pageviews explain why that is not a like why that is a false Choice why doesn't things dichotomy so a good goal is we have build distributed reach to a certain number right that's one of the goals that we have to accomplish and for us that breaks down into a number of possible
 tries but we don't know if they are on day one we sit down and we decide okay what do we know from last quarter what can we build this quarter what kind of initiatives can we have so there might be some very basic things like OK are Facebook conversion rate was let's just say 1% we needed to be 2% that's where you run into the issue of the lack of creativity but we're all saying well there's this whole world of messaging out there this is whole world that push notifications there's a need for Quality Inn integrated into editorial news room that we see existing mobile traffic from Twitter is becoming bigger but we haven't figured out how to stop that from a visual perspective. How do we do that so that's where the creativity comes in in my mind in the product managers and myself an editorial team in our editorial stakeholders have to sit down and figure out well
 how do we grow distribution outside of what we normally have done and what does that product essentially mean to us into our users and in that world you can still fall into very quantitative ways of thinking and I think that's okay and I think it's okay to challenging yourself with the concept that
 having a bigger more more abstract goal of let's having brand new take on how we do Twitter conversion and we want it create a new product for that iterating towards that is more
 it says it's a safer route but I'm more challenging route and I think that if you look at the great product companies that have existed like the apples in the Facebook's in the the Google's obviously there their they're huge companies they have found that way to take a big idea but not just do it right not to say hey we're going to build this because it seems like a great idea that are size that's a big risk it really is and we've made a workflow that lets you still get to something big like our article editor or some of the apps that we're going to be releasing that I can't talk about and it essentially I'm sorry I say that but essentially we we found a way to use it aration to our advantage and not can copper mines I mean it's a constant consideration it's a great question it's a great Challenge and we like to be data-driven that's enough early we like removing as much subjectivity as we can and I believe in my core from a creative perspective
 nothing is not much as truly intrinsically unique and everything's a copy of a copy of a copy to a certain extent and it's your take on all the perception that you have in this world and you have to come up with the next big adoration and what that might look like so I believe in that my team believes in that it's works for us fairly well and it does work with objectives and key results still think that sorry for the long-winded answer and I'm going to look at the window real quick to see if the building next to me is burning down because I'm hearing this like alarm noise coming from
 there are hundreds of tools for looking at user data Google analytics optimizely mixpanel customer. I owe all of these tools can be useful for figuring out how users are engaged with a product unfortunately many of these tools require you to write domain specific code in order to gather the data and set up your Integrations what if I told you that there is a product for writing code only once a single API a tool for unifying your data and Performing analytics on any platform for Marketo to MailChimp segment is that product segment simplifies your analytics so that you can collect customer data with one API and send it to any of hundreds of tools for analytics marketing and data warehousing with segment a developer can satisfy all the stakeholders at once from the data driven account manager to the app happy marketer to the data sign
 who needs a data warehouse with a clean schema next segment your CEO will fall in love with your newly efficient Integrations with tools like zendesk intercom and appnexus I'm falling in love with segment just talking about it thanks to Sigmund for sponsoring software engineering daily if you are listening to software engineering daily and you have not tried segment give it a shot at segment.com and tweet at segments to let them know you heard about the product on software engineering daily we wouldn't be doing this show without the sponsors so thanks again the segment for sponsoring this show now let's get on with this episode speaking of things burning down tell me about the biggest engineering challenges that you're facing and Mike today I mean I'm sure you guys have scalability things going
 tell me about what stuff for sure it's so what we've done and what we've been able to do is what is Big Data essentially is is something that and I don't have a better word for it data architecture but we we collect about 750 million data points a month and that's good it's not enough in my mind there's more we want I just think we're going to get to the billions and billions of monsoon in doing that in a cost-effective way without paying then there's a buttload of money is a real challenge Right End
 comedy bar size with with the kind of perspective of we want to build great products going out and finding a way to architect that and do it in houses is a challenge and luckily luckily we've used great services like a keen eye out so if you never heard of Kenai oh I will look them up they're excellent or great essentially you can send them a bunch of events per month and will store them at scale and they're very cost-effective and you build your own dashboards and you use your own JavaScript or whatever whatever language you want to use to going save this state on the client side and going. And anyway you want so and you structure it anyway you want so if you have a little no sequel experience you can go ahead and instructor it the way you want so it's been really good cuz you've been using it for a while so we've learned how to structure no sequel we've learned how to accomplish clearing from billions of data points we will have some best practices on how the story these and essentially
 we're starting to do is figuring out how to transition to something that we do and house and
 so you two are you saying you want an in-house solution to replace Keen IO not necessarily for everything cuz they're so good they really are but there's certain things that we do want to do in house. Are are going to parallel what were storing and Keene Cassandra Cassandra yes it's way more sophisticated I honestly than just Cassandra I mean they're doing the funneling of advanced into Cassandra and then I don't know what they're using for clearing if there if they're not producing not to something different on the backend I know they allow us to put everything into S3 so we can do our own work with that so it's yes it's some abstraction of I'm existing they did infrastructure but what a challenges for us and we played around with this idea
 is at scale when there's 50,000 people concurrently on her site how do you collect the 25 data points that we might have per user. Challenge is not easy and it's expensive to solve and it's it's a very big amount of higher to do that and there's always more data points oh yeah for sure and so Keen as it has extracted this and it's it's still let us have our editorial engine natatorial engineering Ingenuity around it so we can still decide how we want to store the data decide how we want it. Figure out what dashboards you want to build crayon components around those dashboards and end end we still maintain that ownership but we're not just building big data for the sake of owning every possible piece of our stock it's it's just not it snow in Tennessee like the one of those in-house decisions that we should make at least yet good abstraction that is worth paying for yes
 some of the other the other companies that you're if you don't mind me asking like the other products that you are paying for like there's this really interesting build verse by discussion evolving in the software engineering community because so many companies are building really good infrastructure products and it's like which do you buy and how do you wire them together it's a really interesting question
 so
 it's something that I think we we have very good discussions about here and we've generally make good decisions so Keen is obviously one we used optimizely for a while and we moved off of it cuz it's very expensive and it's more about people that don't know how to code doing a b testing and in a week literally and I'm not one to two fudge timelines but in a week we built something that was just as useful as optimizely so if you have the time and you have an engineer that's free I would go ahead and do that be on that we have working with the company soon called boom train so boom train is going to do a little bit of NLP for us they're going to do sentiment analysis analysis MLP this is something I personally looked into for the last 2 years and I've just
 I've always come to the conclusion that manual curation is probably going to win out but this is one of the first companies that just seemed like they had something that was going to really benefit us okay would it hold on what do you mean by that I'm really curious about what your what Your framing of the the debate around manual curation is yes so two years ago there is this this I think understanding that digital content was going to be big maybe 3 years ago 4 years ago whatever it is at some point digital content is going to be big and getting people to the second page view in the third page view was could be very challenging right and a lot of companies I'm not going to call him out necessarily but a lot of companies had attempts at doing this and are continuing to attempt to do it but nothing seemed like it was to me at least very sophisticated to the point where having an editor who
 the article or not wrote it but edited article say you know what these two pieces of content are going to be really good for us or give me more of an infrastructure understanding of how Mike works a lot of these companies where he says there's a there's a distribution team so there's this team that takes are content and knows how to package it for social networks are experts at I mean they were exceptionally good at it they're super creative they know how to get the attention of user so that's what their job is and they're they're using metrics to drive all of their decision-making so taking those people and having them do related content or putting something in the second or third slot of indefinite article page essentially
 and I was finding that an algorithm would be very hard to do that better than this is what you mean by manual curation like yes people aren't you have a human in the loop doing labeling of the metadata we have a human deciding
 what the title should be of a Facebook post what the image should be of a Facebook post what time of day should go up what kind of angle we should have a language we should be using and do these people have concrete understandings of the algorithms are these people like they have a feel for it and they're like they've got their gut instinct there it's some kind of heuristic
 yeah sorry to call you there is there's no algorithm that they're using what you mean of the Facebook algorithm maybe yeah like they understand how Facebook ranks stuff at it like add some tracks turistic level
 yes so a little bit is like week we will bring in the data of how well these posts do we have a tool it's called lexicon and they can go in and they can look up any article that's ever been posted to Facebook look at all the data associate with it how many people saw it how many people clicked it how well the article did once they clicked it that people share it more and they can say okay and this is how this article produced this kind of alkam and they have templates in their mind and in on paper where they're structuring certain tactics and their there they're looking holistically at all these tactics are performed overtime and they might reuse them they might throw out the window they have to adopt them because not they're not going to work forever because other companies like a buzzfeed are doing similar things and we're all using different tactics in the same tactics so it's a constant Rat Race in that sense and for you know Frost the challenges keeping it high quality and not purely clickbait
 and so there's a lot of heuristic analysis in that sense and Villanova Facebook algorithm which is why Facebook is one of most valuable companies in the world so you know they say they know what that is now they say that they're trying to understanding reverse-engineer it in a very creative sense yeah sure sure what if you had the dream data science team that you can have like as many people as you wanted like whatever infrastructure you would want to build what you feel you could manage it what would you orchestrate what would you want them doing
 yep
 so I thought about this a little bit I don't know if I'm going to be too abstract so please tell me if you want more specifics so if you were to go in the Google analytics you can see these user flows that exists or if you were to use a mixpanel you can segment people and see you okay someone who comes in from Twitter blog
 using shares and then that share goes to a person out there and they come in and they do these actions so there's a lot of different pieces that exist I want to be able to wrap a person acts are person I D 45 and I want to know for the that till the end of time everything that they do on the site where their mouse goes how far they scroll down and up heat mapping where they share who then shares as a result of them and what kind of impact it had on the company forever I mean that's never going to happen it's too big and it might not even be worth building but that is the extent the division and then obviously somewhere back from that vision is where I'd like to end up what is that team look like well
 luckily I think Amazon has amazing products that allow teams to do this in a very sophisticated way with not a ton of resources involved so a redshift the Kinesis a Lambda spinning up Hadoop instances like that that are already image doubt you know the hardest part is going to be hiring the data scientist to make sure restructuring that in an understanding it the right way but I love getting engineers in here that have done a little bit of that and are thirsty to do more and to bootstrap themselves and to say okay I get one red shift is I get what the problem is and we done this before with Engineers that have some experience been out of town and they can work with this software and such a sophisticated way so I know when to go back to your question I want to get dirty and I don't have some really Scrappy engineer's come in and do it and then and figure out how to use these tools to a media companies Advantage because not a lot of media companies are going after the redshift of the world and making them work for them in an ideal
 since yes I'd go after the PHD algorithmic data scientist that are going to say hey if you want to model a user experience for a media company here z25 steps that you have to go through in order to ensure that your data Integrity you know within 10% of accuracy that would be great I would love that too but I don't know if we need it yet let's talk about the brass tacks more realistic engineering scenarios you know some article on Mike goes viral the server start getting hammered
 you know maybe a problem starts to develop give me an idea of how your devops teams work what you're monitoring tools look like we had heard that devops at these news organizations is really challenging and really important because you've cuz up time is so important and if you go down during the presidential election lose trust it's like you know some people who is Jeff Bezos says trust trust is hard one and easily lost so give me an idea what goes on maybe during a crisis
 so
 fair
 the first the first week I was here at Mike there's 50,000 people on for the election the site crashed and it crashed hard there is no caching involved whatever since then
 there has not been a catastrophic in Spain like that at all now I'm I'm there is no I have no desire to sound arrogant at all but I'm curious what the challenges you've heard are from a scaling perspective the since our content is static there is very good paradigms out there for solving that problem whether it's using a barnish cash or having everything hosted on a CDN. Challenge should not be that difficult for super high can current traffic so we don't run into that issue much if in terms of know in terms of having to worry about automatically scaling we already have the infrastructure with all the cashing in place to do that I mean yes we got a lot in France in Peak traffic times but it it's minimal on RD because you're not even making it to our DD it's a minimal honor CPU because you're not even making it to her see if you were using in memory caching
 right below the load balancer and not solving all our problems for the most part
 if we introduced user profiles then we have a different Problem the song let's talk about Millennials on software engineering daily we try to report not only on engineering the focus is obviously engineering but we also like to get a perspective on how the broader World perceives and understands engineering from your work Mike give me an idea of how well Millennials understand what software is like how software Works do Millennials even care about software to what degree do they care about it like give me an idea of how Millennials interpret software
 sure the I would say and obviously I'm biased I would say Millennials deeply care about it in the sense where if something doesn't work as it should
 it's it's and it's forgotten immediately unless it has such a Mass Appeal like an Instagram or SnapChat you build a nap and there's bugs unforgivable you're done yeah and it's it's I think that's great that me and pulley on it so do they care about the intrinsic software and how it's written know do they care deeply about a product in the user experience that goat that the software give to them absolutely we will address that Mike speed is everything us so it we have one of the fastest websites amongst all Publications top 10 we are one of the first people Implement amp and Facebook Instant and we've done a huge amount of work on AMP open source so far and that's where we're always saying about speed cuz that's one of the invisible features right above any product and just give you a quick example so yes I think people deeply care about it and I think there's an emotional relationship that you build with the user and Millennials are
 definitely part of that thought process lucky for us a lot of our users on very modern devices and modern phones and they're upgrading iOS within a month and that makes the challenges from a software engineering perspectives in backwards compatibility perspective much easier and I think giving you that example kind of
 shows how much they care about software and having the newest set of features in the end of the fastest phone and so forth what is your perception of the generation after Millennials the generation was generation why I think people call it the post post Millennials or generation Snapchat whatever you want to call them how do they perceive technology it seems like these people these kids the kids these days they are one with their devices
 it is I think still to be discovered exactly what they're going to do there's a very interesting Trend that they're not on Facebook that often and the Snapchat is the way to go and messaging apps are the way to go though and I think that's right I think they are for some reason Desiring a little bit of the inverse of how we've operated as Millennials which is we were very social this is how we interacted as soon as we were in college we had this Facebook thing that brought us all together in this very Monumental way that we all kind of Reminisce about almost to a certain extent and then you have these kids you now okay the Facebook is the thing that the older people do and you know I can I can talk to my friends and then I'm more fun way like Snapchat I'm giving you a very on thoughtful perspective I think or a not very well thought out perspective I don't have a very very great opinion of it yet but it's the biggest the biggest surprise I'm saying is that they're just not on face
 as much as we are and that's so interesting to me and that. That's really all I can say without making things up Millennial Engineers this perspective I think that Millennials yeah that'll work a job for 3 months then they'll just go off to to bike around Europe with a satchel
 you know you interview a lot of Engineers how do Millennial Engineers differ from the rest of the Cadre
 so are you saying that Millennial Engineers like the bounce around that I'm saying to have a reputation for that at least among the old folks at who I have talked about hiring for hiring Millennials yeah it's I think this is right to certain extent what I'm about to say but there's that you forget I'll answer to the engineer's thing in a sec if that's okay with Millennials in general are very thirsty for meritocracy and merit-based ways of progressing their career and I think that the the the more lawyers of the world that are not happy with the normal partner track in the more out there that aren't happy with that kind of track you're going to see people bouncing around and and and working on their career in a more sophisticated for thinking way how does that translate into engineering given it's a commodity that is very competitive and sought-after yes there's a higher propensity for that to happen for sure
 I'm that being said and I say this all the time even to people I'm hiring in the people on my team I don't accept that I think it is a failure of a cultural and professional development perspective I I think making sure that Engineers are held to a standard of of being challenges is something that everybody wants to do and tries to do and it's an art form and it takes a lot of communication and it takes a certain kind of engineer that understands that moving up to a management position might not be what they want what you see all the time as they get that opportunity to managing people one and now code and manage and in order to manage successfully you can't code as much you have to figure out how to come to that kind of balance and organizations are creating positions that do that balance really well and it's just finding the right time in the right person to fill that not forcing it and for me personally with Engineers it's an ongoing discussion it's ensuring that their hat
 but the work that they're doing that they're challenged and that there's a balance that the understand that you know every now and then you're going to get this piece of work that's necessary I might not be the most entertaining but I guarantee you that the next three things are going to do are going to be better than that and hear the years what they're going to be and it's not an empty promise cuz we have a plan and it takes a lot of my time a lot of my energy but it's the most rewarding part in my opinion is keeping Engineers around is a challenge that I really like and it is one that I think every company has honestly technologically informed media organization how is Mike skaling engineering relative to scaling the media team
 the question
 be at the editorial team is around 50-60 people might teams around 1415
 it's what what I'm going to give you my my current situation I have put a lot of energy with my director of product management into making sure that every higher we have is a very literal linear incremental improvements for everything so yeah Dan engineer you can build that stuff the the the equivalent of how many products another engineer can build and the same amount of time right so are we scaling in the proportion at sense of that at Oriole team no not at all are we moving very fast I'll be gone from seven people to 14 people in 6 months yet so there's it's it's
 a we don't need as many people as our editorially but we are scaling in my mind in a similar fashion and that's a good and healthy sign I think I don't know how good of a dancer that was but it's it's my answer that sounds like a great organization going to work super fishing and everything like that's all that's all I can really hard pain all the time is efficiency down to knowing keyboard shortcuts and essentially
 I don't want to have to hire too many Engineers that I don't have products for them to work on and and can't keep them happy so we'll see where we end up I am looking for 6-8 more Engineers that is for sure so I
 how well if you're listening to this and you're in New York or do you hire Ramon Engineers we have two engineers in Sweden we're building a team out there of multiple people and then we have an engineer in Ukraine and then we are hiring in New York alright so if you had Spotify and you're unhappy risk of going under
 I did see that I was at SoundCloud last week in Germany is heartbreaking it is but they're stirred they're doing a lot of really smart product work so she can be curious to see where the end up I mean it was amazing how they explained it to me they have the largest database of music in the world I mean that's an incredible feat hopefully a license in doesn't posted my own music they're the all throughout College eyes I am a huge fan of SoundCloud I was just like oh my God SoundCloud it's it's it brings me back to the Grooveshark you know world and it's huge fan of Grooveshark something fell a little off about it they'll SoundCloud I think they can make it all these licensing deals are so difficult though so you know I really it would be such a shame I mean we have we have Engineers on this team that are like music producers it's amazing and made
 just to be so sad if they can couldn't do that so thank you so much

Transcription: blockchain Technologies like Bitcoin and aetherium have not yet impacted the lives of most consumers the theoretical breakthroughs that blockchain technology enables will eventually happen I will be able to pay $0.01 to a knowledge worker in Africa without having to pay a $0.05 transaction fee like I do today my servers will be able to pay other servers for small compute jobs we will have decentralized versions of sharing economy systems like Airbnb or Uber but first there are many infrastructure and policy issues to sort through the technology is not quite there yet and people running even simple mining operations are threatened by our current legal framework coin Center is an organization dedicated to education of policymakers and media about blockchain technology quiz there also is an advocate for certain policy changes Peter Van valkenburg Direct
at coin Center and he joins the show to talk about the issues that stand in the way of that utopian dream of micro payments and iot and other blockchain Miracles that we will eventually have Android this episode a lot I hope you do too

 Peter Pan. Ginsberg is the director of research at coin Center Peter welcome to software engineering daily thanks for having me today we're going to talk about blockchain technology and policy and how they exist today but I want to start at the high-level exciting futuristic speculation stuff because I think that will better motivate a discussion around policy and engineering and specifically what I think about the the exciting futuristic speculation I think about the micro payments like I should be able to pay someone in India the equivalent of one penny for a transaction using the blockchain only think about that idea of the you know paying somebody across the world one penny or we think about things like microtransactions between servers what are the barriers to those that exist today are they mostly technical or are they at all regulatory actually finding a c
 will scapegoat either technical a regulatory is hard but we can talk about is your existing options and your existing options are the you know what time I called the Legacy payment rails and that's going to look like either credit card transactions or something more heavy duty like a bank transfer or possibly one of these newer systems that is centralized payment system where you can pay other people who are users of the same system and of course the good examples of those but things like venmo or PayPal or things like that so then to to talk about like are any of those good for microtransactions the centralized systems are are are probably good for microtransactions like where do I buy I bought something that was to two bucks with PayPal and there was no fee because they took it from my bank account and are they were paying someone else on PayPal can't remember what it was but it does that work that's still
 bigger than what you were suggesting which was a couple sense and then the other problem with something like PayPal or venmo is you can only got pay other people who use PayPal or venmo they have to sign up they have to connect their bank account to that and fund that and the funding transaction to actually set that all up is a transaction that's going to happen on the Legacy systems weather credit card or as I said a heavy-duty type thing like a bank transfer a wire transfer so what we really want is you know an open interoperable system that just makes payments as simple as sending packets of data across the internet right I mean from a technical engineering standpoint from the standpoint of I'm assuming your audience that's just what makes sense and it seems silly that we still don't have that so Ledger just a way to move value between piers on a network without having to worry about some sort of centralized intermediary and also without having to worry about prohibitive fees that make us small transaction like 5 Seconds like paying for time on a server
 or paying in order to read a little bit of content or listen to a little bit of a podcast makes those kinds of payments infeasible in the reason for that is any credit card transaction and you know most of us who bought stuff online we always use credit cards generally any credit card transaction is going to necessarily carry with it a a minimum fee on the way to see structures there different whether it's Visa or Mastercard depending on the credit card Network fee structure is usually work there's a flat fee which is somewhere between $0.05 and $0.15 sometimes even more and then there's a marginal fee that's related to the size of the transaction but that flat fee there is is the thing that's deadly 2 microtransactions for the internet or really microtransaction generally because if what you're buying basically is something that's worth about in a half a penny to you like what's it worth the read just the just the lead paragraph of
 Wall Street Journal article you know it's not much but but honestly it also would be cool if we could monetize that because the way the Wall Street Journal gets by is by monetizing their content but they can only do it in a big lump sum you sign up for a Wall Street Journal subscription and you get access to their all of their articles you can't just read a little bit you can't just read a lead paragraph and part of that because they want they want to get you and they want to have you pay for more than you're actually consuming and game the upside of that basically the transaction but also part of its because if there's a $0.15 flat fee they never did ever be able to charge just for reading the lead paragraph in an article because the fee to make that transaction go through would be greater than the amount they were receiving in payment for reading that article so that's definitely a good example there's also like I really think about the example of there
 somebody in a place like India or Africa that has knowledge worker ability and I should be able to pay them you know a small amount to do some search creative knowledge working this type of knowledge work will that that we Outsource to individual contractors the stuff is going to increase as time goes on and we need less friction so that there can be more Global transactions we can have a more mutually interdependent Financial system Commerce system and you know if we have these vulcanized Payment Systems where there are transactions their High transaction fees for even microtransactions right then even even if they're warranted or if they're in some sense the money is going towards preventing fraud
 it's there still onuris charge is fine and that actually gets back to your original question which I sort of weasel the way from which was either is it either regulatory costs are these actual technical costs there is definitely regulatory element so all of these financial institutions that your payment goes through when you're using a credit card for example so what people don't realize how credit cards actually work they just take them for granted you were issued your credit card by an issuing bank so that's the first party that the transaction actually runs through and then the issuing bank has an agreement with the credit card operator Network operator or sometimes there just called The Switch and that's these that's MasterCard and then the third party here and there's always at least three parties in these online transactions is the Bank of the recipient who is that bank is a merchant processor bank for the credit card as well or or just a another
 card issuing bank if you're paying another individual basically but it's going to be a merchant processor in cases where you actually paying for a service for example so which would you eat with each of those three parties and especially the two banking parties you're talking about pretty heavy-duty Regulatory Compliance burdens and some of the costs of complying with say any money laundering requirements here in the US under the bank secrecy act for example which which has to do with you know keeping real close track of who all your customers are where they live in what their you know what they're identifying information is and then also monitoring some of their transactions and Reporting suspicious ones were particularly large ones to the federal authorities Financial surveillance if he wanted to be less charitable than that then the other wise seemingly innocuous AML kyc compliance that has costs
 how many additional also credit cards pay their users to use them so you like when you get airline miles or rewards points from your credit card some of the fees that you're paying per transaction are going actually to provide you those rewards which is a strange system but by the system that actually gets a lot of people to you know switch from one car to another so it's sort of a marketing tactic cuz you want that first class trip to India for vacation or something of the type of inefficiency while the type of tax that were paying at a core fundamental level with the types of systems that we have it if there are also other other taxes we pay in the fact that these older systems are running on this horrifica infrastructure in the dark kinds of deficiencies that are going to have all kinds of leakages because of that and that's why it's you know we're having some green field systems might be good even though I hear that a lot of these
 infield systems are eventually kind of being built on this old aging infrastructure with FTP stuff between Banks and I'm going to do that another another another like futuristic high-level thing is this dream that we have about a coyote stuff we had this dream of being able to walk into Starbucks and you get a cup of coffee and you're charged for it without having to do anything you don't have to interact with a barista anything you just get the coffee and my phone just communicates to the blockchain what is a whiz at this intersection of iot and cryptocurrencies is this stuff where we can start to be thinking about policy sure absolutely kind of skip straight from Legacy payments to blockchain in the end of simple the simple what is Bic lighter what is cryptocurrency answer to 2 to build that bridge is alright so you had three different
 pictures with the three with the two banks in the credit card Network and all them keeping track of user balances or partner balances consolidate all those letters into one call it a blockchain it's a data structure that exists redundantly across multiple computers connected to the network and those multiple computers which are actually off in the computers of users who just want to pay other users those multiple computers hopefully do some sort of trusted multi-party calculation of some sort that results in consensus or agreement from the nodes that the current state of The Ledger of who is paid who which user has paid who is valid and non-fraudulent no one's tried to pay somebody twice with the same funds in other words duplicated or counterfeit currency and that is the invention that is Bitcoin and it really is a computer science breakthrough it uses all sorts of long-standing and well-understood components like peer-to-peer networking technology like
 hash functions sha-256 an elliptical curves on but it combines them in a novel way that creates this distributed computing system that is able to create an authoritative Ledger of all transactions so then to get into iot so so that solves payments potentially and I'm not suggesting that were there right now with the Bitcoin Network because actually with the block size limit as it is right now you might expect to pay $0.15 per transaction using Bitcoin to which is interesting we can talk about that more later if it's something you think your readers would be interested in and what the box I had to be is but it's actually kind of an arbitrary cap and in many ways and not something we would reasonably expect to persist maybe and Ecuador versus maybe not another systems so there probably is an answer here for micro payments and it also might involve new technologies like the lightning that work we can discuss as well but your your question was about iot and and the simple intuition here is okay if we have an authoritative list of transactions that are effectively time-stamped relative to other
 transaction so they're bundle it in order and the order is something everyone agrees on that we kind of have the state of a very limited computer a global computer of us or we have an order of events that alter the state of that ledger and in many ways that's a computer option now we could do more than just keep track of scares balances with this you know with this stately data structure we could notify are we could we could we could notice and allow people to announce when an identity according to sign to a new device has either been been tested to buy an individual says like this is this is my laptop I'm signing this this this device will identify itself as my laptop because I'm signing up a transaction statement with elliptical curve type signature or this is my cell phone Starbucks would say this is are rpos are our payment system
 and these devices can then have an open Ledger of device identity which is basically one half of what you need in order to have that that Ideal World with iot where you just walk into a building that has things that you want you take the things that you want and there's as hand shake behind the scenes that identifies who did the taking who did the selling and it and then actually furthers the payment as well so really seamless you know utopian techno techno utopian Commerce because you have identity for devices that can be trusted and is interoperable and open and because all that data resides on this identity type blockchain and you have payments between those identified devices or parties because you have a blockchain for transactions in my car payment and they might be on the same Block Chain they might be on different blockchains there's all kinds of ways you can architect the system the bottom line is you get this consensus over a data structure and send a stateful data
 picture so you could do identity you could do transactions you could do all kinds of computation yeah and my senses that's where we are today the we will get it will get into the regulatory stuff but my sense is it today the big barriers to this type of Utopia becoming a reality are technical barriers because what was outlined in the Bitcoin paper and what has been done in the implementation since then there's a big Gulf between the big Bitcoin dream that was there was outlined in that paper that would what does theoretically could become and the infrastructure that we've built because when you smash all these computer science Concepts together that Satoshi did you notice oh my goodness we need to build a lot of infrastructure to make this a possibility and that's why there's such a misunderstanding about like the hype cycle around Bitcoin where people are saying.
 the killer app for Bitcoins like okay where is the you know why would you build you know it why would you build an Internet that looks anything like the internet we have today if we had just dial up it would look totally different and that's where we are today with Bitcoin as where we're at dial-up stage I think that's right yeah Marc Marc Andreessen the the venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz maybe 3 years ago now I think saying that you know Bitcoin looks like the internet in 1996 was 3 years ago which means we should be at internet by now and I don't think we're seeing that with Bitcoin I don't think we're seeing you know that means Google should be emerging that means real killer apps for the internet should be emerging right now and we're not seeing killer apps emerging for Bitcoin so I think he optimistic Lee miscalculated and I think he's brilliant I don't mean to you know future prediction is hard but
 I was just going to say that I think the real date is probably closer to maybe 1986 like we're at the we're at the beginnings of widespread use of TCP IP we're not at the beginning of HTML and the higher-level protocols that enabled the highly useful web that we have today on top of the internet what about that company 21 and I know it's a company that has invested and I think he was an ex a 16g partner that started this company 2100 massively every 2 ton of money and they're building some Bitcoin Technologies maybe that's the Google Bitcoin right and you know based on the beginning of our conversation today they're aiming in the right direction so what they're trying to do is really nail device payment so machine-to-machine payments using these systems
 their first I had to take to call it up a product because it was sort of it a dev kit was this this 21 Bitcoin computer which was basically a Bitcoin full node with the capability of mining also and basically an SDK that would help you as a as a developer right any number programs that could utilize Bitcoin for for payments and that could be you know build an API such that whenever someone pays you your Twitter account will tweet hello world or something like that so connecting any number of digital Goods that you might want to sell including say your your influence if it were talking about you know paid for tweets to a payment system in an in an electronic Marketplace that was liquid that can that can actually you know handle that unlike the existing credit card system which of course cannot handle that
 you know where to go or where we've been skating around a lot of different topics around around Bitcoin but I want to get into the coin Center so you work for the coin Senator what is the coin Center sure sure sure small tactical note we try and drop the dog like like Facebook or not the coin Center and we also put a space between corn and Center is so funny how in the internet there's all these strange Norms about enter caps and unifying words of things like this but anyway horribly when Center is a non-profit research and Advocacy Center and we're based here in Washington DC where I'm recording from right now and we've been set up for one very specific purpose and that is to guarantee that open blockchain networks so things like Bitcoin things like aetherium that open blockchain networks get the same benefit from a policy and government standpoint that the
 early internet God and the early internet benefited tremendously from a basically a hands-off approach that was probably best pushed for an evidenced by the Clinton Administration principles for the information superhighway which there were a number of principles there I will go through all of them but it's things like the private sector should lead where regulation is necessary it should be like touch and and activities based not Technologies based so there were a lot of things that came together on the on the regulatory side that I think helped hasten the development of the internet it could have been a lot slower and a lot worse if policymakers had not been well educated on these topics and then people make fun of Al Gore but he was actually pretty well educated on these topics at also other day well understood the upsides of those new technologies and maybe only focused on the downsides and then had not sort of cleared the path for free and ocean does technology
 by either subtly adjusting existing laws or by refraining from think that would have encumbered people's abilities to innovate using the Technologies so the same issues that the internet had open blockchain networks have and they might even have it worse because they deal quite often and actually at a fundamental level with a scares tokens money and whenever you no money enters the picture it's kind of the original sin it changes some of the some of the risk and benefit calculations that someone like a policy-maker Mike do we have a really good tradition of protecting speech and people's abilities to speak in the US and we also have a pretty good tradition of protecting their privates men decide week at least some you no expectation of privacy over our personal data it's interesting with with money money is speech in a way but you know do you have an absolute right to
 play people actually not you right now can I pay someone in a Ron for example if you did you'd be in violation of ofac sanctions laws and the penalties could actually be quite strict I'm in from a privacy standpoint we actually have no right to privacy over our financial data none whatsoever basically assuming we use any Financial intermediary like a bank or a credit card company at that moment we lose any right to the privacy of those those those transactions and that's why this financial surveillance regime that I was describing is is so robust basic any transaction you make over $10,000 will be reported to fit sent unless you're doing it to an institution that is Rogue which I would recommend so focused on education you want to educate policymakers you and educate the media you also have an element of advocacy so you ready to take certain stances on areas
 of the blockchain where do you stand on financial surveillance we haven't been sort of a Firebrand in that area primarily because there are other issues that are of prime importance so just the ability of people to even start a business in the space is one of them but you know I'll say this so so we generally don't regulate individuals ofac is the exception there from a financial privacy standpoint it's not even privacy it just means you can't pay people in a ram but from a privacy statement we generally regulate institutions not individual so there's a number of companies out there Bank of America etc etc who all have to register with fincen as a bank or at the Money Services business so PayPal somebody Services business airbnb's probably yeah I'm quite certain is a Money Services business cuz they move money from their rent tours to the red tees
 register you also need to track your users and Report their transactions if they're either suspicious or over $10,000 as I said and you need to do really good to know your customer so you need to find out a certain amount of information about the there's no way around that now there's an open question or there was an open question rather when Bitcoin first emerged he's a company that does something with Bitcoin and that's something could be a variety of things like hold other people did coins it would be we mine Bitcoin transactions it could be we build software that help people hold their own Bitcoins so I have option. Info which creates a wallet product basically that allows people to hold their own coins are any of those companies the kinds of financial institutions that under the bank secrecy Act fincen is allowed to to mandate that they register and do that kind of any money laundering Financial surveillance regulation on those companies and fins and settled in 2013 with what was called the virtual currency guidance and said basically if you are a if you're in
 change or hosted wallet provider so like a coinbase or is that bow or a circle then you are a financial institution in a series of other opinions because that original guidance was somewhat vague in some areas did pretty well clarified that minors for example do not need to register they are not regulated financial institutions in that sense for surveillance purposes and neither are software producers who merely make a Bitcoin wallet now where we would take a very strong stand with regard to financial surveillance is that that current we can call it a compromise that current compromise needs to stand and we cannot move in the direction of of mandating that people who just design software that other people use build sort of back doors into that software that will monitor those users activities so blockchain. Info as a provider of hold your own Bitcoin software wallets should not be forced to spy on the people who
 use their software and a minor so someone who mines transactions validates transactions on any of these open blockchain blockchain networks as an infrastructure provider despite the guy that they may have some visibility into these networks should not be mandated to do that kind of surveillance either we want to keep the set of surveilled entities to those who are traditionally regulated by these laws and that is people who hold other people's money for them you know Banks Pay Pal and yeah coinbase and xapo and circle but not get Siri but not blocked

 so I wanted vacillate back to the engineering side of things will get back to policy the blockchain sore the side of the block size you mentioned earlier so what what is the debate around block size give some more color on how engineering of Bitcoin is going today at the guy I'm trying to hear this basically that if you are a cut if you're cutting edge if you're like if you're a liberal blockchain Nest you use you hack on aetherium and if you're a conservative blockchain Nest you hack on bitcoin because Bitcoin is sticks more to the things that are outlined in the Bitcoin paper like it was handed down to Moses and a theorem is a little more aggressive and Heather Heather changing things just give me a snap
 out of the of the engineering Landscaping sure I think you're right that there is there does almost appear to be an idiot logical difference between a theorem and Bitcoin and you could say that that is some a political one like liberal and conservative or just a general approach to how things should be built and there are positives and negatives to say about either side in that debate you could call the aetherium people naive and and to risk seeking basically because they'll build build things rapidly iterate rapidly and those things often break as inside the case of the Dow which was the largest crowd fun in history and also one of the greatest failures to do a successful crowdfunding history what are you could say about the Bitcoin people as as you were hinting that this is a dogmatism that is not based on reason but based on the fact that it was handed down from Moses Satoshi but you could also say positive things about each so
 Assyrian developers tend to seem less encumbered by a pre-existing bias as to what the system should look like what it should accomplish and seem perhaps more focused on just Building Technology that works to do any number of things not just the one thing you liked which was say intermediary list payments but then you could say positive things about the Bitcoin developers as well you could say something like well they understand that the foundation of any trusted system needs to be simple because that's what becomes more complex the attack surface broadens at becomes more vulnerable in the whole thing and take the internet for example TCP IP is very simple and it's a great base layer to build more interesting layers on top of whether it's HTML whether it's SSL anything that you you want to to describe the packets that are moving over the relatively purpose eggnog
 check and secure lower layer so that's one way I would characterize the too and I love both quite frankly and then you asked about the block size which is which is which is sort of evidence of the deep conservative ISM as you suggested of the Bitcoin developers so the core software that Bitcoin is powered by has a number of consensus rules and consensus rules are everything from no transaction can reference an already spent input transaction in other words you can't try and spend the same Bitcoins twice that would be fraud and counterfeiting another consensus rule however is that new blocks so new bundles of transactions that have occurred roughly over the last you know 10 or so minutes cannot exceed a megabyte in size and you get down to the technical specifics that means that given the size of any ended
 transaction the maximum number of transactions you can have per second on average ends up being around 7 if your liberal in your calculations and actually in practice we find the network gets very creaky around 2 or 3 transactions per second which if you think about what visa advertises about their credit card authorizations and I would quit visas just doing authorizations they're not doing settlement but they still you know do these offers ation Visa does on the order of 40000 50,000 per second I think and I've heard that they built Data Center capacity to handle as much as $200,000 or $500,000 you know it's out it's the orders of magnitude larger so it is a problem that the block has this one megabyte cat if you really want Bitcoin transactions as in you know I sign of transaction message with my private key and send that transaction basically or enumerated that transaction a recipient based
 Bitcoin address and hope that that goes to the blockchain and makes it into the Ledger if you want to do Global Payments in that setup using Bitcoin you're going to hit some real limits as far as through put in the main one just to clarify so you're saying that the blockchain the global blockchain can accept 227 transactions per second the Bitcoin Lockton yep and the reason for that limitation to be also very clear he's an arbitrary variable in the Bitcoin software it's not necessarily Network latency or any number of other real technical problems it's actually a line of code in the Bitcoin core client that says that blocks cannot be larger than a megabyte and if your Bitcoin client recognizes blocks that are larger than a megabyte your data will be ignored from the consensus as prima facie in invalid so and in a sense so
 I guess the is the reason that that is actually somewhat defensible somewhere without reason is you could say well you know we want at the most fundamental level of the Bitcoin blockchain there to be very low constraints on the bandwidth do you need and then you know we could build these things on top of it that based on the trust that develops at the lower layer or based on other systems that you want to build on on top of that lower layer you can you can build the speed and that's what lightning Network Sardis yeah so that. That's exactly right that's that's the argument that those who are vehement Lee against changing that arbitrary variable to be a larger cap or removing a couple together that's the argument to those who are who are against that change make which is we want this thing to be a minimum minimum viable product basically for doing settlement and then you could be
 sickly build higher-level networks that batch a bunch of transactions into one or two transactions and those one or two transactions are the ones that end up in the blockchain and he's like automated Clearing House Clearing Houses but ideally the automated Clearing Houses also would be basically trust minimized so that you don't you don't reinvent the correspondent banking system you you you basically use cryptography to bundle transaction messages in a way that doesn't rely on on putting the face in any intermediary parties pretty complex so it's probably beyond the scope of a of a shorter podcast but it it it it generally achieves that in theory and we're seeing actual prototypes begin to emerge now that would basically accomplish that sure we did a show about a year ago with Rusty Rowe awesome works yeah he works it blockstream I think and that was all about like networks in
 I mean this is Rusty Russell I think it was one of the early contributors to Lenox yet he was like number to to Linus Torvalds for a while and that gives you some perspective in terms of the talent show is working on these things yeah and end this concern about Big Blocks would you you hinted at is is very real to it's not just that the network would get slow because of the limitations of bandwidth in a peer-to-peer Network it's also that with limitations on bandwidth you would create some perverse incentives that could defeat the main goals of the Bitcoin project and does perverse incentives basically look like if your a minor you get an advantage generally as being the first to receive the message that another minor has completed a block because of that block is valid and added to the chain and you want to build the next block on top of it the faster you get that previous block which is necessary input to your next block the more likely you'll hit upon the next block
 before any of your competitors so if the blocks are big and you actually have real latency there becomes a real strong incentive for minors to geographically Cole okay and they'll probably all geographically located in area with very affordable power or electricity because these mining rigs are electrically intensive which means you could very realistically if the block size increased have a greater chance of all the miners ending up in western China near a hydroelectric Dam that was Bill for a town that never materialized for example which which is actually quite common or maybe all in Iceland or maybe all in the Pacific Northwest of America although that seems less likely given the regulatory risks you'd be potentially assuming but no matter what if it all the miners end up in one small area how trust minimized is that system at that point because of all the minors act together in concert for prolonged period of time they can do a lot of harm basically they can effectively just block or selectively
 you sir are people from transacting using the network if they don't like their politics or their history or a number of other things about them or they could potentially rearrange the chain starting from the time that they assumed that majority power up till the present potentially you no fooling people into thinking that they paid and then and then having to pay again
 okay so now we have drove a little into the technical aspects I would love to hear more about how a theory am technically compares to Bitcoin value I want to I want to bounce back to the policy discussion I'm so one thing the coin Center is concerned about is consumer protection so consumers engage with an entity like coinbase and coinbase functions something like a bank but the difference from the consumer protection point of view is that the the policymakers need to understand how to enact laws that protect consumers without infringing on technological process of technological progress of Bitcoin
 beeline to walk why is it tricky for policymakers to figure out a way to effectively regulate a organization like a coinbase while not infringing on the technological progress that might occur so with consumer-protection and with the US specifically as our are regulatory landscape we're already at a disadvantage compared to say the European Union or other foreign States and that's because in the US consumer protection for money transmitters that is to say people who hold and then move people's money who are not Banks those are money transmitters consumer protection for money transmitters is done historically and somewhat by accident at the state level so Alabama does Consumer Protection regulation New York does Consumer Protection regulation and the federal government actually doesn't do
 watch consumer protection regulation date on license and permit businesses to exist they wait for the states to do that and then maybe in for some other consumer protection concerns through individual actions against Bad actors so what the states are doing what everyone of the forty-seven states and territories that regulate money transmission for Consumer Protection purposes are doing is basically saying no one's allowed to do this unless they first get in touch with us and then get a license to do this with customers in this state and that doesn't mean that if you're a business in New York you only need to worry about New York as far as getting a license from the the regulator in that state if you are a business in New York that creates a Bitcoin service like my coinbase for example you're going to need a license in every US state where you have customers and Because the Internet usually is well Global you're going to have customers from day one potentially anywhere and probably
 in many states and hopefully if you're successful all of the states so that means you're going to have to actually get permission from a regulator in every one of the forty-seven states and territories that regulates this and getting permission from them is not easy it's especially not easy when you're doing something that's new because you know Regulators are smart people but there's more people who have Focus their whole lives on Legacy Technologies and guaranteeing consumer protection for those technology so the companies that money transmission regulator in Iowa are used to dealing with our Western Union you know the original telecommunications provider for or Matt or or maybe at the most exotic PayPal you know which emerged about you know what 10 15 years ago on 444 them you're not up to speed on bitcoin and you have no idea what what you know these Technologies even are virtual currencies or what necessarily you're supposed to require from these companies that are suddenly asking you to give them a license to have customers and in your state
 and on top of that your laws so as a regulator you have obligations basically better sit down and legislation you need to protect consumers from you no risky money transmitters basically by licensing them but in the statute money is defined as the currency of a of a of a foreign Nation or of the US will wait a minute Bitcoins not money according to that definition do we even have the statutory obligation to regulate these companies so in some states Bitcoin doesn't fit the definition of money or a business like coinbase that uses Bitcoin even though it's the definition of money doesn't fit that states definition of money transmission and Regulators have to figure that out lawyers have to figure that out and then there's Beyond. Even the question of whether you as a regulator are are interested in dealing with this issue in the bottom line is as resource-constrained as a lot of regulators are especially at the state level many of them just haven't wanted
 deal with this question so even if you're a coinbase and you're a company that really wants to get regulated cuz you don't want someone knocking on your door at the middle of the night saying you were an unlicensed money transmitter and you're going to jail for 5 years because by the way that's the criminal penalty for that even if you're trying to do the right thing you're going to call up someone potentially in in some state in Middle America and they're going to say you do what with what I don't know if you need a license I'm not giving you a license you know maybe check in later but in the meantime we're not going to tell you you're safe we're not going to tell you you don't need a license for this. Where your unlicensed and that's not really that doesn't give you a warm fuzzy feeling of somebody was building this technology or building a business because that means that somebody could knock on your door in the middle of the night and say actually even though you called us and asked you did need a license for the last 2 years where we didn't give you a license and so you were in violation for those two years and now we can see penalties so coin Center's Mission when it comes to consumer-protection regulations
 here in the US there a specific issue is to fold its to make sure that if you are a company that holds other people's money that there is an easy path for you to get regulated because it makes sense that if you're holding other people's money there should be consumer protection regulation and that means either pre-empting state laws through an act of Congress which is politically not viable right now quite frankly that's just a lot of political Capital because you'd be basically you know doing something quite bold from the federal level and stepping on a lot of people's Authority at the state level or it means getting all the states to sort of agree that this should be the common approach to licensing Bitcoin companies that but that means going state-by-state educating them on the technology analyzing their loss to see if the existing laws cover these activities and then if they don't cover these activities or if they cover them in a way that doesn't work that that would simply make it impossible for coinbase to get license but would still make them responsible for getting license
 then those laws such that we can find a way forward but that approach as my colleague Jerry Brito likes to that scale and coinbase Center rather we we try our best to go stay by state and get in touch with any Regulators turning to these issues so for example in New York Benjamin lawsky at the Department of Financial Services turn to these issues right when we were getting started with the bit license and we actually didn't particularly like Halibut license came out we've done a lot better and some other States since then no matter what it doesn't scale it sort of reactive and we have to get all 47 States and territories on board so recently we've been given a gift actually in in this struggle from the one of the oldest Financial Regulators in the US the office of the Comptroller of the currency the OCC is the federal agency that it's a is a branch of Treasury actually is the federal regulator who Charters National Banks so most of the big banks are nationally Charter
 thanks and the OCC is there consumer protection regulator basically alongside the fed and the FDIC for insurance purposes the OCC issued an innovation white paper last spring basically that said hey it was really quite Frank and amazing it said hey the US is falling behind on fintech financial Technologies Innovation we're falling behind the UK we're falling behind Singapore and were partly to blame the OCC is actually saying that they are part of the problem so it was actually a Mia culpa and kind of surprising it's not something you usually hear from a regulator that sort of admission of of a fault and they said look we're open to to new suggestions as to how to improve us competitiveness in financial Technologies and they said one thing we're going to do is create a central office of innovation and you know we're not all that bullish on anything centralized so
 hopefully that'll but they also said well we're open to your suggestions as well and so coin Center along with some other companies in the virtual currency space and also some Marketplace lenders to also had issues with state by state regulation so I can Lending Tree and things like that all of these groups got together and then you shoot a bunch of different comments most of them asking for a federal fintech Charter so you as a as a as a company that builds some sort of innovative Financial tool or service and that would include someone like coinbase who builds virtual currency tools and services can apply potentially and this is not yet the law but hopefully will be kind apply for a charter from the OCC and that Charter is kind of like being a Chartered Bank but it's more limited so maybe you won't be able to take deposits in dollars because that's something we only want things to do and maybe you won't be able to do the lending because that has to do with the dollar money soap
 but what you could do is have access to the to the to the payment system so that you could I could ACH or send a send a payment message to coinbase from my bank and coinbase to process it directly rather than having to go through a banking partner and process it and the other thing you'd get from this is federal preemption of your state money transmission obligations because National Banks don't need to worry about state laws so it would be a way through the sort of wilderness of conflicting state laws if there was this vehicle if coinbase could say we want to become an OCC chartered nationally chartered fintech firm then they wouldn't have to worry about the 47 States and territories anymore I've got another half of that if you got a second I know this is really long winded so the other half of this is the other problem is that those 47 different states and territories that all have different definitions of money and a bunny transmission some of those definitions are so broad that
 could easily interpret them to cover a minor a Bitcoin miner in fact you could probably use interpret them has covering someone who just develops a Bitcoin software for someone who runs a full node in their living room in order to relay transactions on the peer-to-peer Network and that means that even those parties potentially would need to get licensed and that is a huge heavy burden and a sword dating or permission inning that we would not want to see happen cuz it would really stifle the development of these Technologies this is one of those laws that had an analog with the internet that would have potentially stifled the development of the internet so how do we fix that notice the OCC Charter option doesn't solve that person's problems because they don't hold other people's money they do a noncustodial infrastructure type function on the pic why network are the aetherium network they're not going to go apply to become a national your other day that doesn't make sense for them but they still have to worry about 47 States and territories and their various vaguely drafted laws so forth
 Queens Center has proposed we sort of sketched or outlined a possible Federal legislation that would be an act of Congress but would be a lower a smaller ask from Congress then asking them to fully preempt state by state money transmission and what it would be is a safe harbor so Congress would say something like States play a vital role in consumer protection for money transmission however there are a set of activities where in people provide infrastructure to these virtual currency networks there are set of activities that should never be or she'll never be treated as money transmission by any state and thereby that federal law would create this Safe Harbor that would ensure that somebody who's just developing Bitcoin software or running a Bitcoin node on the peer-to-peer Network never needs to worry about any one of the 47 States and territories that potentially could regulate them that's also very important to us
 glad we we are aiming to be advocates for the technology in general not any particular company in the space so we're more like the Electronic Frontier Foundation then say the internet Association where I an independent nonprofit who who wants to facilitate the growth of the technology and so this aspect of of the money transmission problem is actually probably our top priority is making sure the people who are just you know garage innovators independent software developers people running nodes in their living rooms that those people never have to worry about money transmission regulation it is hard to accomplish because we need an act of Congress but it's definitely one of the biggest things that we feel we need to fight for ya show and where we are now in terms of the where there's some gray area and even if you're just a minor you really be in trouble are there any angles on that that are opportunities rather than risks like can I start a
 Bitcoin casino without risk Rick is there some way I can evade taxes using Bitcoin where I'm potentially safe in the u.s. yeah so it's always going to come down to the specific specific laws that govern the specific activities I'll tell you right now that gambling is one of the areas where you're really not safe and gambling's actually really interesting not just because I have some bad habits and end up losing money but gambling is really interesting from a legal perspective because it's one of the chinks in the First Amendment armor that we actually have to explain what I mean by that generally someone who only design software is pretty well protected by their first amendment rights so this goes back to the case called bernstine versus the doj I think this was an early test of how First Amendment protections applied to people who are writing
 cryptographic oriented software or really just software in General Tso Berenstain was a photographer who was publishing cryptography standards of course and at that time that those those cryptographic functions that that software was classified as as basically weapons and we have very strict rules governing when you can share information about weapons or share weapons with foreign foreign States in section section section when you can publish these things we have with export control laws for weapons technology and so when he was publishing these these cryptographic standards he was basically there was an attempt to censor him to say you can't be open with that software because that's weapons and you're exporting it basically to our enemies potentially and the e f f and a number of other important organizations I think the ACLU probably as well came to burn Stein's defense basic
 and said look he's publishing stuff you could write in a book he could write the source code you can write the machine code for you know in a book and publish that book are you saying you're going to ban the distribution or sale of that book and it turned out that in that case burn sign one and so this was this was a really important Triumph in the early development of the laws that govern software design is that you have free speech rights to the software that you design not just to the new no political words he write on a paper but also potentially to the to the mathematical formulas and the software you write on a piece of paper or or onto the internet now one area where this law doesn't hold up well as in gambling software so there's another case who's case name has escaping at the moment where there was a company that was making a bookie software so it would help you keep track of bets on horses for example and so you'd open a shop and you have people come in and watch the horse
 is on television and you keep a computer in the corner that would keep track of all the books for all the current bets of all the people in your in your in your gambling shop and and it would have other fun features like if you press the right key combination the screen would go blank or turn into Solitaire so and the reason for that was if the cops burst in you can even hide evidence and maybe I'll even automatically erase the books if that's something you're worried about from a from a law enforcement standpoint now the developers of that software even though all they did was developed the software they didn't run the the book making shops that they weren't bookies they got in trouble for Interstate trafficking in gambling paraphernalia and there was a free speech defense that was attempted in their case you know they said hey all these guys are doing is writing software and the court said something along the lines of and this is not the Supreme Court this only went out to the Appellate level I'm fairly certain the court said something like well yeah but the speech has merged with the
 illegal activity because their software can only be used relief for illegal gambling that is now illegal speech and it's one of the few cases where a speech Act and the development of software has not been given the kind of First Amendment protections we normally expect expect that act to get and so this is seems like a long digression but the long and short of it is if you were to write a smart contract on aetherium that does gambling and God knows there are probably a fair number of people writing that software right now they're prediction markets yeah or or potentially prediction Market you would not necessarily have robust First Amendment protections for your activities and you might be very easily charged with Interstate trafficking in gambling paraphernalia that is such a shame I think that the stigma against gambling is so aggravating to me it is so is so weird so
 it is one of the greats I hate to use this word here is what are the great schizophrenia is of our
 of our country I think it goes back to a long history of what is considered malum prohibitum or malum in SE or or or what is what is considered immoral basically and then and then that moral judgment is reified into law and book the standards around those tend to be really wishy-washy to like like when does when does my software merge with a something you think is morally wrong to the point where you can prevented me from writing software pornography is another great case what is pornography what is obscenity there's a great Supreme Court opinion we're basically comes down to we have no good standard for what is obscene but I know it when I see it right so how how are big institutions like Banks investing in blockchain Technologies this is this something where it's like they are legit
 remitly investing in it or is it sort of like you know IBM with Watson where they're like a we got a I or and then some more of like a you know just for show type of thing so sometimes maybe the more charitable ways of saying that just for show is we have blockchain as a strategy not necessarily were adopting of blockchain technology for real you send any kind of application but we got a blockchain strategy you know it really runs the gamut so I think it's some cases these are big older institutions that are simply worried about the so-called innovator's dilemma and don't want to be caught off-guard but the innovator's Dilemma basically says that they will be caught off guard because they're base their expertise lies in a field of endeavor that is completely different than where they're being disrupted
 form fit the new technology to their pre existing business model like when windows I heard recently that like the early versions of Windows mobile was basically the Windows model where like they sold like you had to buy the operating system throw it on your phone is just like the classic case of like you try to form fit the the you know I hear this church of Apple like they over there trying to put the phone in her face on the wash and it's just the wrong is it just trying to form fit the new technology against their pre-testing Bismol right but then there are also some companies that are being extraordinary Progressive actually so Santander of major global bank I believe out of Spain I recently announced the pilot program where they were going to put banknotes so you know basically a certificate of deposit of A Sort on the aetherium blockchain
 that's probably the right approach frankly and they're going ahead with it which is pretty awesome I mean it's going to take time to make things like that work but it we're not necessarily headed towards a future where the only currencies are cryptocurrencies we could be headed toward the future where there are cryptocurrencies and then there are still you know Fiat denominated sums and balances that are issued by centralized organizations but who is scarcity and movements are controlled because they're built on top of a decentralized Computing system like aetherium so a smart bank would potentially be issuing currency of A Sort fiat currency according to a to an open Ledger on or layered on top of an open letter like like a Syrian that's very cool and we'll see what happens there and then the other big thing about Banks and financial institutions playing with these Technologies has to do with the architecture so your listeners may have heard of r3cev for example or
 there's a few other companies like them who are planning on Building closed or you know sort of private or permission blockchain or blockchain like technologies that will facilitate interbank settlement or agreement between banks on contracts and pessimistic about it we can say are you just want to retain the same control you used to have its permission door closed meaning that maybe it doesn't have public read-write capability or maybe the read capability is public but you can't write to the to the blockchain unless you're one of the pre identified Consortium members that could be you know sort of just trying to hold on to their to their control and an in a cynical way doomed to fail but it's also kind of like the days of the early internet when you had a lot of companies who were playing with TCP IP and setting up their own private
 brunettes who eventually then connected to the global internet because I saw the value proposition but we initially comfortable enough to jump fully in so that's one of the general tropes that were seeing emerge in in how financial institutions are coming to this is that they want they want a system that still has some level of control they're not ready to go. And blockchain network and just play on and some of that could even be regulatory a potentially you're supposed to know your counterparties on a regulated Financial Network and so it's transactions are being mined by a minor in a Ron that makes you feel uneasy because you at bank or worried about talking to a regulator about why that just happened although I would say from a legal analysis standpoint there aren't actually that many big impediments to Banks using open networks right now assuming they build some sort of sensible layer on top of it that only allows their customers to transact with you know known entities or so
 like that but maybe that takes all the value out of the network as well anyway I've said a lot of things I hope they're sensible so yeah well I think the cigar place to stop amateur talking to you I think people who are interested in this policy stuff around Bitcoin this is going to be a evolving area and I think winter is a great repository for material there are lots of white papers and articles on the coin Center website so go check it out if you are interested in this policy stuff man thanks for coming to show up here yeah thanks for having it was a lot of fun

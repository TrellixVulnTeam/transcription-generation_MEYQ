Transcription: on software engineering daily we often discuss big data in terms of data engineering and data science data engineering is the infrastructure and pipelines that handle massive amounts of data and puts that data into a data lake with a did infrastructure in place a data scientist can study the data and take action on it a data scientist can also create visualization which is the subject of today's episode are really a Mosher has a specialty and mapping and data visualization today we discuss how to create effective visualization of our data and the tools that can be used to collect and present our data whether you work at the New York Times or a small tech company whether you're a data scientist a business analyst or a marketer data visualization are important because data visualization can we use to communicate important Trends across an organization after a quick break from a sponsor of software engineering daily we talked about data visualization
mapping with r l e a Mosher
 as a software engineer you have tremendous leverage in the employment Market every company need software engineers and these companies are all competing for you the engineer a scarce resource but as an individual engineer you don't have much insight into this incredibly opaque Market that's where hired.com comes in her.com assigns you a talent Advocate who works to understand your needs and works to find you the perfect job go to hired.com se daily to try out the platform today and get a $2,000 bonus if you find a job the companies on hired compete for you the engineer and then make bids to win your talent these are companies like Facebook and Uber companies that we know are on The Cutting Edge of engineering because they've come on software engineering daily to talk about their Tech stack
 I have used hired personally and I've experienced firsthand the ease of finding a well-paid enjoyable job this was way better than replying to LinkedIn messages from uninformed recruiters and is also certainly better than using a job search engine to find a great job and support software engineering daily go to hired.com se daily and get a $2,000 bonus upon finding a job check it out it would support the show now let's get on with the show
 I really am Moser is a community lead at the Mozilla Foundation she has a specialty in mapping and data visualization and she will be speaking at the upcoming strata plus Hadoop conference in San Jose irelia welcome to software engineering daily before you worked as a software developer you spent time working on data visualization for the purpose of Journalism I realize that there was software software development in that role but this is a great place to start our conversation because news is a prime example of how new visualization techniques and increase the volumes of data better software all these things can lead to better products in this case news so what is going on at the intersection of Journalism in technology
 oh I think a lot of development work and a lot of like you said a lot of experimentation the web development space at least a lot of libraries to people don't realize a lot of JavaScript libraries came out of Newsroom New York Times Like backbone underscore and I think he's doing a lot of things with data visualization like New York Times especially is putting out a lot of awesome data visualizations there's groups like box and 5:38 they're basing almost almost there, news output on data-driven journalism which I think is great but they're also really good space to build skills as a developer I think there's a lot of emphasis on being able to ascribe to really compressed timelines
 able to work on short Sprints very badly so I really appreciated working in journalism or they're always new topics to explore you get a new assignment every few weeks you're jumping around all the time and you feel very motivated to try new and experimental approaches to how to how to visualize the information and how to incorporate it into a larger narrative because you get to work with material that's so interesting so you get to work with things that are no fed to you through investigative reporters were on the ground in other places you get to work on a story that imma be outside of your Beats are your domain but are really exciting and it's fun to switch it off so so yeah I'm not sure if that address everything of your question but how to news organizations organize their data scientists and Engineers cuz a lot of a lot of shows we've done you know engineering organizations or Engineers working with other in
 how do journalists and data scientist and software Engineers work together that's a real coup partment elevation of different tasks so before her 2 news they were tips hair company and we had a devops team that did all our deployment stuff and I just did front end things and I work with back and Engineers to do more of the back end things but there isn't so much of that break down in journalism sometimes you are the developer and that means you do everything and I think everyone's had experience with that especially if you work in the stuff I like the startup space you're used to kind of wearing many hats but I think it's especially true in journalism a lot of journalists are learning to code to those who haven't already in a warp software developers of some pointer or didn't have formal training in computer science so there's a fair distribution of knowledge in web scripting languages
 front end programming a lot of designers to I rarely works with designers who didn't know how to mark up their own designs so the front end I think so in and back on and off and those people that are hired with a specialty are pretty strapped between projects are really under-appreciated department at the get this probably true and a lot of things but it's in journalism Turkish people don't really understand the complexity is going to supporting projects that are going to be viewed by a million people may be as soon as they launched or Election Day projects where suddenly everybody's visiting the site and everything has to be perfect in all that has to be working in the data pipeline has to be constantly screaming and down time is your audience sometimes a bit more empathetic I think when they know that it's a highly technical project but I think people visit news sources online and they don't understand all of the
 the technical muscle and capacity behind it so they're less than pathetic to win the side goes down or what it's not loading or when there is incongruencies and how things are described in the text and the visualization that partners with it so it's a lot of pressure what did you learn about the the devops of a journalism organization
 oh well we are so what I Works in news I worked with an organization that helps turn left side with the shaky and Inter news Kenya so in turn is Kenya in East Africa did a lot of a training materials that they would train to listen how to use security software to protect their sources and and how to do a visualization for their projects but no she can be in the same token I built a Mac software for journalists to use to collect on the Browns stories of to support their articles so I didn't get to work in a newsroom like they are times or propublica or some of these other groups that a lot of stuff Loz who are affiliated with my same program it was a lot more stories from my friends who are on Dead Ops teams about what it's like to work in the news World it can be intense
 okay fascinating so there are a number of news organizations that are trying to make a shift to having a greater focus on technology and end date do you have any advice for how these types of organizations can make that shift
 yeah I guess IMEI take the groups that I mentioned before Vox and 538 that are kind of pop-up shops doing great work in the data journalism area already kind of piloting this but they're they're working in the more of a startup mentality in a small shop of people all focused on on data visualization and data analysis and data science in general and it's harder for bigger oryx who are used to doing more traditional reporting to dedicate time and and resources to to date of abolition projects or our data analysis but I think it's usually works out pretty well when they partner with groups that make tools to help journalist or just help the general public visualizer analyze their data so I seen Partnerships in the past but ipython-notebook so journalist can publish their analysis along with some visualisations that are created to so people can see the code and then they can also see it paired with sandals the resulting visuals
 I've seen a lot of like a turtle TV when I worked there we had a lot of Partnerships with news oryx and we would actually dedicate engineering resources to building projects that we thought were particularly promising an awesome because it's good publicity for our company and then it's also great for the journal ask if they have some more technical muscle behind their projects so I think it usually works out well and they partner with their parties because most of the people who build tools would love to have a new story to Showcase how their tool is useful and most of the people working on the story and I'll have a lot of great date of it they might not necessarily know what to do with it so so yeah relationship glossed over maybe one mainstream use case for if he's approved data visualization techniques in the past data visualization was mostly about
 presenting simple graphs and spreadsheet data in Excel but it's expanded into a much bigger world within software one area within data visualization that you spend a lot of time on his mapping so tell me about a recent example when mapping provided you with a useful visualization for your data
 okay so I worked on a project a little while ago with Carla TV where we did a partnership with this group G dealt which is the global database of events language isn't owns it's a Google project that was funded to collect all of the news media publish and then it's subcategories it and tag it and then build an API that would allow people to access data and kind of understand you'll pockets of the world where people are talking about terrorism in the form of media or Pockets where they're talking about him some other topic and then compare that with social media discussions around those topics to see what are citizens talking about casually and then what is the form of media reporting on so they had this awesome API but nobody was using it because it's a fair amount documentation to figure out how how to access and use all of the tags and data and then how to parse through it and also how to then visualize it into something that's meaning
 call and focus your analysis on something that's that's important to you so we ended up working on a bunch of naps related to that API and that project was awesome but mostly cuz after we've created these maps that would show like okay well people are talking about pollution or there's a conference is happening in this area and we can analyze the discussion based on social media and when we made this current serve accessible gooey where people could search for terms and then it would match the terms in mediately you really got a sense of the heat map of of topics and also like Gap areas where the most keep the most coverage about ebola is happening outside of West Africa so what does that say about our from a meteor like certain places where it's something a civil war would not be covered it all in the local media but would be over covered by external media and that leads so you know your suspicion that maybe some of their claims or factor of its peaches
 actually on the ground now investigating this so it was a really interesting project and then for us and then afterwards we got some publicity from different media sources who wanted us to do particular analysis now she's on what interest and what topics they wanted to explore so we started doing some more interesting machine learning on top of that to try to parse out okay well I want a journalist wanted to do an article on Wildlife crying so she said okay well we want to do some research on on poaching this published in the form of media but toching if you're looking for any article and I'll publish across all these different form of media Outlets could be in poaching for a higher it could be Poached Eggs it could mean lots of different things that aren't related to killing animals said it was an interesting challenge to try to write all the edge cases and figure out how we were going to write something that had right sort of an extension today if you are that would give some Integrity to the map it was created at the end
 so I doubt that was an awesome project and I've also worked on a lot of different sensor data mapping project switch are bit more small-scale because I like are cominos in Little Hardware packages that we're building our selves and some deploying them in small environment Cipro Shahidi we worked in Tanzania on this project to study agricultural sustainability and farming techniques in a particular region of Tanzania sensors and we also had people monitoring them and then the hell this is Oracle data from this group who had already been doing that so we can go to their data we matched it with ours we tried to create this timeline showing or time series location of how what the values of the data that has been collected so they were putting these a different water gauging stations on rivers and trying to see what the water flow rate was and what the temperature was and how much
 access to that kind of irrigation different Farms had in that area and what we found in mapping it was said there were a lot of there's always issues with Jada especially if they've been collected since the 60s and 70s because at some point someone had to transcribe that and everybody can't collect it differently and so the relative dating mismatch issues but we found huge pockets of the different regions that the data was just useless or the values you had no units and they're all these problems of the data at the time that we were doing this project the organization that we partnered with was looking for more funding from their funder the The Gates Foundation and so building this map really showed okay well we need to not talk about this region we don't have any good data to support the claims that are being made about how effective this project is we need to figure out what's going wrong in this region and those discussions only happened as a result of visualizing information
 that's fascinating you know you mentioned this sensor stuff and mapping the real world is heavily influenced by the capabilities that we have with sensors in the real world what what can you say about the state of iot and and how Internet of Things Sensors how that affects the data-driven mapping work that you do
 oh yeah good question so I work with a group that a few friends of mine started called No thoughts and it's about developing scripting language libraries that allow you to access Rd know so I could write JavaScript to an Arduino using Johnny 5 which is one of the JavaScript libraries that lets you do that and then that's great because I'm web programmers have the ability to to use Hardware in their projects I've been working on that for a while and I've done a few projects like the agricultural sustainability one and then one that's a bit more close to my heart that is about mapping data about bee colonies in certain communities and trying to study the environmental factors that affect Health with it they grow or or die off these are dying globally and it said it's kind of a big issue but anyway less I'd from that I work on kind of small-scale Hardware project so I'm not really into the indoor mapping space or the
 not all of my little Hardware devices connect and speak to each other so it's not perhaps as sophisticated as some of my engineering friends who work in iot but but I think the potential is exciting I think
 there is some language around it that's a bit over ambitious for what can be achieved but it's kind of like a lot of people been talking about it for a while and some things are actually highly semantic on the web now so I guess I can't really say that anymore but I felt like that conversation just sort of stagnated for a bit and I think there's a lot of discussion about the the potential for internet of things to work out like in Connected Bridges and having your whole minnow home office all of your devices talk to each other and everything everything works together in this sort of harmonious text set up this example of of putting sensors in I think you should different waterways in Africa and collecting sensor data based off of that that sounds like a very
 like a fraction a bowl real world use case for what we would call iot I guess that was what I was more Curious how was like was like yeah it was like you know I recognize that there is a vaporware ish sort of conversation around iot certainly in America and then there is some realistic stuff going on with iot whether it's in Africa or if it's in warehouses or something where there do you know loading lots of packages and stuff in this is highly controlled environment I guess I was just wondering where you have seen this actual is actually you don't affect or or drive you know real world use cases or if there has been a stuff you've seen it but
 misinterpreted you before I think some of the most interesting stuff I've seen has actually been outside of the US are the small group that meets up for new boss but really interesting the bee analysis projects that I started working on actually we started in Buenos Iris Argentina and then Latin America in a few different locations where they had beehives and some of the resourcefulness of the people who will set up your sensor kits if you send them to better price of those countries it's actually really remarkable and people are really excited about collecting those data mix and perhaps they're not so saturated with all of the data centers can detect to be activity all the environmental sensor so temperature the weight of the Beehive will determine population to the noise that they make
 determine how happy your Healthy they are so you can also do audio sensors there's a lot of things lot of different environmental factors humidity can also indicate how successful or long surviving the hive will be there's a lot of stuff that I was just kind of ambient things that I was collecting just to see how it would affect our community because climate abnormalities in the area that I was in so I thought I wonder if that would kill them off or if they're very resilient in different locations to when you compare data those same environmental science setups you can kind of see how certain environments for Lee Foster and will be gross and Allison how the way that the hive goes down slowly so you can tell that the fees are dying off and they're not surviving and maybe you know Norway is on the Blessed best place
 you can make a really nice Bowl starter kit for anyone and send it out to them for for very low cost

 get back to the things that you can't on me like writing code
 the the date of production side of things and I'd like to kind of talk about the data ingestion and the data processing data visualization side of things shows about these back-end architectures that grapple with giant influxes of data so give me an idea of the interface between the volume of Cincinnati in Africa for a beehive and you can be taking readings as much data as you wanted to so what is at the intersection of this this date of production I guess in Ingress point and then the the the egress and the the processing in the visualization of that data
 that's a good question because you're right you can continuously it takes a the readings I think usually with a starter that the sensor kit for the beehives I kind of just monitor it for a few days I'm put it in graphite and you know some a few tools to visualize it the preliminary readings and see what was interesting and then ultimately I just kind of break it at down into very human understandable chunks so people understand you know a reading everyday or an average reading every week but they might not understand and the utility of reading every second or they might not even be interested in off to go to a website that has a you know of cubism JS visualization of how it's changing over time you know they might not be interested in that they might just want to know okay if this week out of the Year these are the average readings the next week they went down or what went down and what was bad so in translating it to the visualization that usually involves mapping or changing the timestamps that you're dealing with to something that
 human processable and the same is true for the sensor data for analyzing water flow rates in Tanzania like I the format that they gave me for some of the earlier date assessed was like that text files that actually the naming conventions were all off for what what particular station they referenced it was kind of unclear at first when the data was collected like they would say every two weeks it'll go read the meter on this particular sense or sad and sometimes he would do it on time sometimes it was no entry the date it was pretty messy and so just finding okay well I've established now that I'm going to take a reading from this week and then this week in the next month or this week in the following months I'm just be consistent about what we could I take and regardless of how clear consistent the data is I'm just going to use that as my Nano starter set and then from there. I've been to
 the more granular things if I decide that it's necessary to show up to Downs between those those kind of Milestones so there's a lot of massaging massaging and I'm translating them those are there were a few scripts this order processed the textile that I was receiving and put them into a machine readable format and then and also cleaned out all of the empty no values and sometimes to people when they're manually entering data right they say sometimes meant to hurt entering units which makes it a string and not a numerical value so trying to figure out how how to go through and clean all of that in the automated way it's probably the first step for me and then and then after that trying to figure out what's what's the general Trend show points can I pull out the most significant values that are reader will be able to process keeping up with the volume of data
 oh that's a good question
 no I mean not for I used for the visualization of the Tanzania data there was a map that shows all the changing stations and you could select a particular station and then it would pull up a few charts and graphs based on the readings from that station and I used a more souped-up version of high charts which is a JavaScript library that lets you make a bunch of just charts and graphs but it's called high stock and it's more for stock readings financial data right so it was a bit stronger so I did I did do that I've done things like I said with graphite and cubism for more granular time serious and I think those sometimes you have to search for a library that supports you no more intense amounts of data and it however The Newsroom and then in journalism you off and work with cs bees know your
 this file will be maybe you the largest Monday deal deal with this like election results you don't really deal with huge who do pension instances or lot lots and lots of data so I do a lot of small-scale things yeah development of data visualization tools you said that developing good visualization software is about developing something that is as reflexive as your eyes what do you mean by that quote about is kind of related to using sensors of satellites and satellite captures like of the world's can be stitched together into a relational authentic view just because they're so detailed compared to some abstract example and I think when I think about building things for the web I often
 try to make something that's
 that at least strives to be as complicated as as your eyes mostly because your eyes have some of the most advanced compression algorithms known to man like you look at that you can look at something 3D environment in automatically prioritizing and reprocess it and understand color is understand understand where you should be focusing your vision all of those things happened so quickly and with data visualization so she's really some kind of lag right there's a a load time you'll have like a scroll wheel of waiting well something Lowe's after you click a filter even when you're using a web math right you have tiles that are loading so those need to be stitched together and if you scroll to fast you can see the tiles load so you kind of see how it's not that I actually have in the world in the palm of your hand is just a web browser view of the world and if you scroll through fast you you run off the page so
 so yeah I think trying to make the users experience as a natural and as fast as possible makes them feel like there were there really in the visualization they really are immersed in it and it's kind of like what we how we operate only see things in the real world. Called mapping the Matrix I guess I'll of alliteration and then also I feel like maps are something that has come. Definitions and different disciplines and I'm major see the same like massive different definitions in mathematics that can mean like a smooth surface between their data type in C plus plus they're tagged in some scripting language is there also would like a Geo representation of our world so you might be familiar with more cartographic maps and that's often what I talk about but
 people of all these maps to describe grass relations between entities like in a character map in literature so the definitions are pretty married and matrices of the same right they can be as abstract as a situation or sort of substance within which something kind of bills or originator for Bella absorbs contained they can also be a lot of attention just for the film reference I'm sure people will attend just wondering what it's about but also I'm talking mostly about mapping scientific data and mapping satellite imagery and I'm talking about napping things that post the subatomic level level so doing like chemical mapping exercises with people used our software when I worked at cardi B to build models for sub atomic interactions they also used it for mapping with satellite imagery in mapping views of the worlds are there are terrestrial world and then also for mapping and geocoding things in space Seoul
 stay by Maurice based on satellite imagery so I'm I'm working at all the sort of scales from subatomic to Cosmic and I thought it was appropriate to have what kind of large-scale talk title
 what are the commonalities from from subatomic to satellite level of the types of work the that you would do when building an effective visualization so two items to each other with some kind of reference our location right so you're geocoding your data on top of a base map but I guess in any case all the maps to make regardless of their scale or kind of fictional representations of what you're trying to display right so we don't really know what things look like at the subatomic level mean we can guess we have some microscopic her even smaller imagery to suggest how things interact and how they work but really when your mapping something at that level you you're building a model like a gas the best gas in the same
 is true even we Mac things that are larger scale like mapping the world's right every projection is different people are always arguing about the Integrity of certain projections you really just looking at a 2d representation of what would otherwise be in 3D World and that's always going to be a bit artificial so I think the challenges in a lot of data visualizations are trying to make sure that that Artistry and that artificialness does not get in the way of clarity and explaining an idea with some kind of concise visual language I mean are you trying to iron out the artifice though like it seems like as a map where you're trying to present a point you're not necessarily trying to do it in the most realistic formal presentation
 yeah totally although I think some of the Integrity of Journalism or Lisa's values of being a journalist with Integrity that you should try to maximally represent things with the most authenticity it's still true for data visualization you're not trying to fool people into your agenda necessarily or your perspective you're trying to add honestly display the data and say like well this is what I've been served about what is being displayed here but you shouldn't notice anything that's particularly biased in the representation
 right yeah that makes sense I mean okay I was reading about the talk that you were going to give at straddle pose to do and there was other quote from you that said sometimes the tools to build Maps can be as obscure as the data that we are trying to parse what do you mean by that quote station is a way to process it and make it a bit more manageable so the day that sells can be kind of scared too especially if you have a lot of it and then sometimes the tools that we make the process the data the documentation is really bad and there's just there still a barrier to entry so you journalists at least who are trying to figure out how to work on Deadline have to kind of parse their time between okay do I teach myself this to all this supposed to help me process these data or do I just you know go through it myself manually and and don't use any kind of automation because
 I understand what's there and I can get it dig into the data right away and not have this this barrier to entry where I have to learn a new tool first I think one thing that we really worked hard on and I kind of still struggled with at the end before I left her daddy was making documentation that made it easy for people and it's it's always really hard to do that when you're building tools it's really hard to put yourself in the mind of your users and say okay well not everyone is going to spend all day every day with this is Library like I am not everyone can understand it how do I make it accessible to the audience but I want to so with it and yeah so I think those are important consideration interesting what kind of tools are you helping to develop at Mozilla
 yes I work on the open sides team which is an appendage of the Mozilla Foundation that does outreach not to journalist like I like I worked on before but two scientists who are interested in open-sourcing their research or learning about how to safely open source their data and all of the software that they write to process their data so we develop a lot of tools that are for that purpose for both like training scientist so we have a lot of training materials on how to choose a particular license or what to do with certain data sets how to clean them but their appropriate for a lease and what kind of platform should you use for releasing with your papers in the data in tandem with that and we also do kind of smaller projects like collaborate which is a an extension of GitHub that pulls scientific projects into the larger scientific community space where other scientists can join
 your initiative on a particular open source project and then you can track and promote it in our community by mozella so work on that we also work on study groups which are kind of academic get repo that lets people set up a quick easy website for organizing a study group on their campus related to science and open science and then we have all this curriculum that they can that for conversion and add back into our library in repository of different curriculum tools and then program where we fund post-doctoral candidates in The Sciences hours in the day to sign says to work on a few projects for 10 months and get funding from Wasilla to do that so we have a few we went to Cambridge we have one in Vancouver we have wanted Midwest and one closer to home here in New York and they're all doing different scientific disciplines in different topics but one of them right now is working on a tool
 Sidewinder that allows scientists to Fork each other slide decks and kind of mix and match and remix different talk material that wall so exciting the original like two objects that they created when they open source their slides and then another one is working on this tool for creatives for science that brings a bunch of designers into the scientific community in allows them to easily kind of make comments on scientific papers or in visual representations of scientist create because scientists are notorious for not being very good at data visualization or at least treat and kind of boring grass or Cypress and patients that are in which Comic Sans and I don't want attractive so this is a tool to marry a community with the scientific community and then we will have fun random pop-up projects like we have a site I just bought the domain for open science. LOL cuz I found out you could buy. LOL
 the Main Street buying all these Dad it's a worse it's worth like buying your name I don't know what is an important topic for you but we're going to make it a little Miss myth busting site that showcase is a bunch of scientific discoveries or or things that have been subsequently to bonked or myths about if you open source for research and what will happen to it or will someone scoop you and we're going to try to debunk some of those mixed people are more enthusiastic about open-sourcing their research paranoia in the about the academic Community the scooping thing so is that is that a fallacy actually occur
 I just read an article of buying them actually I didn't just read it it was about a year ago someone wrote an article about the phenomenon of simultaneity and scientific discovery and how often there are at least 3 people in the world thinking the exact same thing at the exact same time and it's a strange in a coincidence it really has nothing to do with them you know each other but ideas 10 to emerge in in clusters at the same time in history so I'm not sure a lot of the competition could even be helped if if scientists maintains in the closure on all of their projects but I think it's starting to pick up in in at least on our community and insides can scientific or academic institutions associated with The Sciences now I know like the University of Penn State or University of Pennsylvania just made it a rule that when they're hiring for
 searching the Sciences they have to come prepared with an open science approach or statement to what they would do about open source science research because they're enthusiastic about soliciting faculty that are really Pro open science so I think it's building on people are a little less scared about it but there are also tools like Mandalay and and Shake share that allow you to share your scientific papers and submitted for peer-review in a community so it's opening up but there's still a lot of thing that you know if I reveal that I'm working on this idea that someone's going to find better data and they're going to do more research and so many freaking listeners already know what's up with that that simultaneity thing that you mentioned that's the most recent instance of that that I heard about I listen to this planet money episode about the the origin of those
 hoverboards you know the electronic gyroscopic balancing things apparently there's no single creator of that it was like one of these I mean there is one guy who may have been the original Adventure but it seems like it was one of these simultaneous invention sort of things everybody saw all at once every every Factory inch engine saw all at once that you could build these things and then they start building them so it's pretty interesting
 going to close in some time talking about the broader cultural interest issues that you're interested in your part of a program called girl develop it which is a program I think it's based out of New York and what are you doing as part of girl develop it did mine started it one Sarah chips who's I develop are there jobs for community and her friend Vanessa started who also works she worked in finance in my programming for finance software but I've been at the purse is still involved with the girls not a big project to but when they both got CTO jobs at other companies they asked if I wanted to move up from TA in classes to just helping out so girl develop it as a preface does build curriculum open source curriculum to teach room
 how to code but also if anyone had a code he has classes particularly for women after work and on the weekends that introduce them to kind of the syntax of most of the web scripting languages and also some back in languages and some IOS and Android for from mobile developers so we have a pretty nice curriculum library now and several years after starting where I think we're almost an hour 10 years old now it's a bit crazy but so we just started doing small classes in New York to kind of build a very strong female community in programming and also scripting languages were anything entry point because people really supposed to my friends and myself included I only took a few classes in college that would even be relevant to what I do now and most of the things I learned I learned on the Internet or I learned from other friends or I learned on the job when I was expected to do something and just had to jump in and reason
 irritation alarm at so it was an easy entry point because it's a lot of a lot of jobs script and then and what programming is is very Visual and people get the kind of satisfaction of refreshing the page after they were something and it changes or even just going to a page and opening up you know your console or an editing the c f a stand seeing how the page changes and it's really satisfying so we got a lot of students in by showing them so that visual component and then they stuck around to learn more and then after that I'm single then moved on to boot camps are they became developers themselves so now the project has 48 Choppers in the us and we're pretty big as well
 so so yeah it's pretty it's pretty awesome so I do a lot of logistics now I do a lot of curriculum review and curriculum development and then I also plan classes I teach some classes I just wrapped up a class on remind me to check yes or like we also do introductions to Frameworks in libraries to for our Morgan students so yeah that's the kind of the great project and I think it's like talking to this earlier that it's kind of like the closest thing that JavaScript I think yeah I was going to say I feel a little bit timid even teaching it sometimes because I'm always worried that if you teach too much magic people don't learn the basics you know they don't know why something is worth it should work that way I don't think they're so awesome like the way it handles a loss and how old you have to do very little for some of that setup which can be sometimes a nightmare to set up
 but then sometimes I like to teach these new students of framework cuz what if you know what I say don't understand a lot of the basics I don't know I think the more magic the better like the more black box magic in it does those things for you the better because no seriously because like the thing that you're just worried about is the drop off as long as they don't drop off eventually they'll figure out that oh this was black box magic and it's doing something under the hood more complicated and I need to figure out how it does that but whenever you're doing any type of teaching of programmer programming my opinion is that it's just you're constantly worried about are they can drop off
 you don't answer for Jim Daly we we try to have an ongoing conversation about the issues around gender inequality in Tack and given that you're part of a organization called the girl develop it that's 10 years old I think you're someone that's worth asking about this I saw a statistic recently that said 60% of women in Tech reported being sexually harassed and I'm assuming you're okay talk about the stuff from where you stand is the gender inequality situation improving I think it's really hard to speak from any position that isn't your own and I've I've had like a lot of luck I think in in the Tech Community I was felt very challenging interested in engaged and didn't really have a lot of problems personally that I'm also very good at shutting people down verbally if they give me any trouble so I'm sure this
 is true unfortunately but I've always kind of seen it as I mean I worked in chemistry before I did web programming so ladies and I'm kind of used to it so I'm not really upset or intimidated by it I think one thing that is getting better is that I see a lot more women at things so I guess that's how it's a strange metric to judge something that's a virtual right by or the community that's mostly virtual by saying well I see people in in person at conference but but there's a lot of androgyny on the web and you don't really know where people are coming from so it's really hard to assess that to me and really understand what's going on until you go to a conference like I got ran over something and then you see okay well there in 05 women speaking or maybe you know they take a picture with all of the women at Austin and there's only 20 in your life how I never read
 but then you look at pictures from years ago and there were only two right so now I think things are getting better and I feel like a lot of my talk sir are well-received I never have a lot of problems with people being judging or presumptuous about how I got to talk or whether it was some kind of funeral formative action on the part of filling a quota for women at a conference site I feel like the community appreciates A diversity of speakers and diversity of contributors and and I've been fortunate enough to experience that side of it so do you feel strongly motivated to do something about the amount I mean I'm assuming I understand that you can you feel you you've gotten lucky but it but you but you also a firm that you feel the statistic is realistic the 60% of women reporting in Tech reporting being sexually harassed do you do you feel an obligation or a compulsion to try to
 to reverse the course or or is this more of like a beast you say more of his that passively they will change over time or exactly reverse but not working but I think I do have a it sometimes stressful when you're at at something when you realize that you're suddenly representing your gender and you think so if I can't ask a question because if it turns out of the dumb question then everyone will say oh look at XKCD comic where you know if your if you want to makes mistake and Matthew know that it's assume that it's because she's a girl she doesn't know how to do math it's not because you're an idiot you just don't know how to do that so I think the same is true like there's a lot of sometimes a lot of stress in it
 Nation about making sure that you're always on point because you feel like you're going to be the representative for your audience of of your gender and that's that pressure is is kind of stressful and I do feel a lot of extra personal pressure to to maintain our reputation as good contributors to the community and intelligent human beings and so I think I do feel that kind of pressure and I also feel a lot I enjoy very much mentoring a lot of young women in programming and I find that I noticed patterns in in their own insecurities and I'm pretty receptive to it now so I run a lot of like little volunteer mentorship programs in my code review sessions and we have them a girl develop it to do we have Coco view my coffee sessions were people can come in and and partner with them or experience developer and learn about what's wrong with your code or even fix the resume or prepare themselves for a technical interview like I
 I really enjoy doing that and the mentorship part I think it's really important for for minorities in Tech
 we've talked some about media in this conversation and how to present findings how to prevent data software engineering daily as a media organization and I'm always curious how come we better approach this issue the issue of women in Tech is there a particular angle to take is there a particular underreported side of this or what what are some you know what would you like to see light shined on in the in the area of women in Tech
 that's a that's a good question I think
 I wish there was more public research about women owned companies and women run shop like at the science lab we always get emails from AOL Mail scientists will say oh dear sir you know and I won't wear for women who work for two software engineers and and two women wear scientist so it's always like well no exit there are no servers but that's because we also don't eat too much and I think there's a lot of lack of publication around women who you know start companies and and are actually the CEOs of tech companies or are working and if it does not does a paucity of them and they're on a lot but I would love to see more of that because I think it's very motivating to hear from from women who who are really piloting a lot of things like I know but I suffer example she started this group called developers from good and then code montage and got a bunch of funding from various like Big Tex Founders Inn in San Francisco to start a fire
 check that I don't think anyone even know she leaves because she kind of down Place her own role in it so she I'd like to see more of that I think a lot of attention is put on oh wow people are abused really horribly at some conferences and when people when young people get drunk you know young men will say inappropriate things sometimes and that's that happens and it's really unfortunate that I think a lot of media attention is put on unfortunate trolling and not on okay well where are the women what are they doing are they contributing and can we highlight what they're contributing
 yeah that does the definite conclusion that I've come to so far is try to try to highlight the tech aspects of it rather than the women aspect of it and the women aspect of it is sort of obvious and springs out of the fact that you're interviewing somebody who is a woman in Tech anyway well thanks for coming out of software engineering daily it's been super interesting talking to you I look forward to seeing your talk at the strata and keep up the awesome work

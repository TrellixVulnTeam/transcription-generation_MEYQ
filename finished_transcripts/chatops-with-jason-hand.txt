Transcription: chatbots are your newest co-worker slack hipchat and other chat client allows developers and other team members to communicate more dynamically than the limits of email companies have started to add chatbots to their chat rooms at least box can give you technical information they can restart a server they can notify you that a build is finished of all sorts of uses Jason hand is the author of chatops managing infrastructure in group chat and he joins the show today to discuss how chatops improves development and operations by centralizing lots of functionality in group chat a Dana Salinas is the host for today's show she's also the host of the excellent women in Tech show a podcast that we highly recommend it's interviews with women in technology talking about technology it's a show I relist to a regular basis and since we're on the subject of bots I want to thank O'Reilly media for recently providing software engineering daily with a ticket
2 Baht day it was a really enjoyable experience and they're going to be some other upcoming shows about Bots and some material that I learned at bot day so with that I hope you enjoy this episode about chat apps

 Jason hand is devops evangelist that victorops Jason welcome to Subway engineering daily so you come from an extensive background in Information Systems technical support devops and you've witnessed the increasing popularity of chat apps which a higher level involves having access to other tools within a chat group to go beyond basic conversation and take actions that can spend from sending a nurse holding incidence to restarting servers so in what ways is the next generation of devops are there any new problems it's a dressing or is it existing problems the main things and probably the the clearest benefit from some of my chat offices that it helps to provide a space for teams to be much more collaborative and to share a lot more about what they're doing
 Saturday not only with the conversations that they're having but also the tools that they're using and how they're using those in that type of thing and one of the big things about devops is that we become a lot more focused on trying to be collaborative across different types of teams here in lot of things about breaking down silos had a great way to do that is just to be more transparent and and have more conversations about what's going on throughout the day across different teams so if you think of just with an it you've got typically some people that are more like a sysadmin type of roller and operations team and then you also have developers and I'm database people and networking and all that kind of stuff and traditionally they sorta operated in their own silos are within their own groups and rarely today interact with a lot of the other groups so one great way to sort of change that and start taking more of a devops mentality is to use a group chat tools such a slacker hipchat and then if you start using third-party Integrations or maybe a chatbot you can
 turn that group chat tool into an interface into all kinds of things that you will have to do throughout the day the tools that you use in that type of stuff so Chad is a great way to address the collaboration peace and getting people to be more sharing so for me that's kind of exciting Place exciting thing about you. So I guess specially in terms of Incident Management since that's what the company I work for Victor Ops that's the type of service that we provide do you think it was the increasing popularity and Technologies or tools like slack that pushed Us in the direction of incorporating devops in a chat to become chatops I definitely hope I think that it's helped a lot the term chatops and and the things that really people been doing for a long time that that fall into that chat Ops conversation we've been doing that since before slack since before hitch at the term chatops itself came from the folks over it and they were using campfire at the
 but if all these things we've been doing you know since back in the day when we all use an IRC but certainly through the end of the sort of Hysteria of the new modern group chat tools such a slack and hipchat it's definitely made it a lot easier and I think it's helped with the adoption of it a lot just because those tools are are so easy to start a sore to jump right in and start using and it doesn't take a lot it's not very high learning curve to get any of those things because it is much better exactly especially with slack for example I think they got a lot of a lot of the market share simply because the process of onboarding a new user is very not only Pleasant the sort of fun to get in there and understand how the tool works and then once you get in just eat the general user experience is pretty nice I think that's been a huge IQs reason why I slack is done so well
 how did you first start using chops was it back in the day where it was mostly IRC or what what sort of things were you trying to accomplish a long time ago you know and IRC just it wasn't really anything that was work related but we would create little box that would just sorta interact with each other and you know we didn't call Chad Ops or anything like that but as it's involved certainly people within the it space system administration type of rolls have figured out different ways to automate some things through chat tools like IRC but for me personally I didn't really sink my teeth into having a focus on what I can automate from within group chat I'm not only automate but like I'll be able to execute and then have that contacts available to me within the conversation I didn't start thinking about that until really about two and a half years ago going on three years ago now I when I first started working working at victorops in the reason being mostly is because the service that they were provide
 and the service that they are providing is for folks who are on-call and one of the ways a lot of people use our service is they send alerts about who's being paged in and what the problem is and and all that kind of stuff they send it right into a group chat tool but they also use the Victor Ops 2 for the same way so it just sort of Lent itself a very very well to the types of things that I was talking about in terms of Victor Ops and advocating for people to go into a group chat tool not only acknowledge that they're going to work on some sort of problem or an incident but also have conversations about what they're doing within that too also sort of a at a certain degree victorops is providing some sort of chatops functionality within their own tool which is kind of what got me started talking about it
 so let's talk more about Shadow Ops recently I read your book from O'Reilly Chatham's it was a very good intro to this topic what I like does that you start to finding it by getting started with Val using a bot and then later on you build on when to incorporate a lot so when I start focusing on getting started without using a bot and what are the things you mentioned is this push model were you're constantly pushing content to the chat how does that information make it to that Chad Cline what what are some of the API systems currently exposed so I suggest special in that book I suggest the easiest way to get into this type of stuff is to just use some of the Native third-party Integrations that are available within either the slack Marketplace or the Alaskan
 Marketplace for hipchat you can go in and see all kinds of tools that we use em typically SAS base tools that you can go in and very easily get that integrated into your group chat tool and then once you've done that you don't want you put in your account for whichever tool you're using information about what takes place in those tools or in those Services begin to show up within within a group chat so for example yes and what's a good one too too sore to start with and what's that people use a lot certainly get hubs at 1 that a ton of people use especially companies that have some software development going on inside their ite organizations and so the way it works is that me as a developer once that integration has been made between slack and my GitHub account anytime I commit cocodrie take any kind of action within get Hub on your my account the the sort of
 result of whatever it is whatever it is I did will not only show up to me back in my own terminal but it also show up in group chat so if I was to commit some code into like a master Branch or something typically I would then after it completed and it was successful I'd communicate to my team you know what I did and what the result was hopefully that was successful but now I can just do my thing I can just push my code do the commit and then all of that additional information about what took place in and that kind of thing and whether it was successful will automatically show up into a group chat room where everybody can sort of see that that type of things I would say GitHub is it is a perfect one specially if you're doing software development another one I'm not a lot of people use simply because a lot of companies use the tool is Jenkins sew a setting up Jenkins is really easy so that you can make sure that anytime you start a new infrastructure build that's going to show up back in your group chat tool and then Victor Ops is another good one but there's there's a tons really what I suggested
 go out and search through the marketplace of either slack or hit chat and find the tools that you currently use and then go ahead and get those you know plugged in and and configured and kind of take it from there find out are these tools providing us that good of information is being really noisy and therefore not that useful anymore so it's kind of a a little bit of a trial-and-error process beneficial for example wiring up
 committed when we can just simply look up these things I don't know we can use skid log or other commands to check when something has been checked in like what sure why I think it's a it's a matter of personal opinion not Everyone likes to be just constantly provided with you information they actually want to take a moment to go find something out there or they like to just you know when they feel like it's time for them to know something they will query for that information I'm others they sort of want the on-demand type of thing just constantly pushing to them in some sort of timeline so I'm in a lot of the talks that I've given have mentioned that so much of what we do throughout our day to not only consume information but also share information is done through a timeline weather that's in a group chat tool that we use in or maybe just text messaging Oreo certainly is all of social media that's how we ingest our information that's how we share our information so we're very used to that type of mod
 for just consuming information and also passing in no-passing things along and I think part of the reason that's part of the reason why I slack is done so well but also why there's this shift with an it to just sort of have that information available to you and if there's something you care about make it so that it's going to tell you the moment something to you know so I took place so for example like if I'm a developer I may want notifications set up so that whenever someone on my team does push code I made aware of that immediately so that I have that awareness but others may not necessarily want to have their information provided that way so maybe they just you know things are going into a general room but they don't necessarily want to be alerted on it they'll just go check that time line or go check the log like you were saying whenever they feel like it
 like you said I get the emails from everybody in my team so by having them in a child you can sort of feel throw them in a smarter way or or sort of like an archive right for newer people yeah totally amazing that's a good point that you are creating this long-standing logger an archive of what gets done and who's doing it and whether it worked but you know we kind of know these days that the emails really not the best way to communicate and it certainly not the best way to be alerted to something now and in the example you gave you know it's just code being committed so how quickly you need to be allergic to something like that is you knows I guess somewhat subjective but in other cases are you know like with Victor Ops when we know we're trying to let somebody on your team know that something's broken and I need to do something about it that's a little bit more urgent and you wouldn't want those types of alerts to just be coming to you via email you want that to show up in a group chat tool so that somebody can you know reactant and do something immediately
 yeah and the other thing that you mentioned in your book about getting started with Chad Ops without a bot is sort of the reading mode the query mode where you have access to some information and you just carry it through the chat client so what have you seen are some of the key groups of interest for this approach is marketing user experience team product managers it's a little bit of all that actually I think it originally started maybe in our support team where we were finding that fairly often we would need to SSH into some sort of server that was hosting or had an alias or or some sort of replica of all of our database query a few things about certain users and certain user activity I know that one that I would do a lot as we get a lot of request to extend the trial for Victor option and that was as simple as just running in you know running a query on a certain
 a database and then maybe running an update Commander something to to change a field but it started for sure in technical support for us but then quickly moved into both sort of the operations of the Dead Ops areas of the of the engineering team but also the product team because there's so much good information about sort of user Behavior but also just all kinds of things that were related to the back and infrastructure of Victor Ops and sometimes it was important for somebody on our private team to find out something about user behavior and it got to the point where maybe myself or or someone else in the project team would it would have a question and they couldn't answer that question on theirs on their own they didn't have direct access into a database so they would have to reach out to an engineer and ask them to pull information for them so that then they can you know digest that maybe use it in some sort of report later on and and once it gets to a point where you're buggin an engineer you know you're giving them the good old shoulder tap like every
 5 minutes it seems just to get some information that's a pretty good indicator that you need you need access to that information so you don't have to go through them and and you know they don't have to switch back and forth between tasks and so we started looking for easy ways to be able to query some of our databases and allowing the bot to do it for us was one no obvious answer to that and that way you can do it from within chat and whatever question I'm going to you know ask the database essentially is going to get fed back into the group chat to so people can see I will Jason thought you know. Something about something and he wrote this little query in the ass is about to go find something for him and then and now everybody's got the same context in the same information the one where we go in and query something yeah only because you know there wasn't any kind of there's no Plug-In or anything in into our own services so we had to use a script which is then just triggered from the bot
 okay but there are things that you can do without a bot for reading yeah I mean if you're just talking about queering information I know that there's a lot of cubot scripts out there that will just go you know if you just want to know what the weather is you can you ask them what the weather what is the weather in it'll go out and prove that information for you so but you know I don't for us a picture up so we don't have a ton that I can think of with the exception of maybe an arm now I think about it maybe within our sales team we actually do have the ability to and now this isn't using a botanist Sara Lee this is actually using a service called zapier zapier I'm using and making it so that whenever something changes within our sales force sort of account then zapier will notice that and then zapier has a plugged in a plug-in into slack and so I can have some I can have some updates about things that are changing within our CRM Salesforce
 show up within within our group chat tool so for example of if you were a customer of mine I could set you know type in something I'm using that integration and it would go retrieve your record a sales force and I didn't even have to go into Salesforce to find out information about you and one of the other things that I was reading about this system is that there's a notion of channels in rooms and groups can you explain a little bit the difference between these the only difference is it's completely semantics it's it's just the difference between the different chat tools so slack is you know kind of the most well-known when these days and slack uses the concept of for the notion of channels which or just the unique sort of break out conversations so we we have a Krups have one that's just called General and any you know anything can go in there and then we've got one that's really just for our engineering team
 are front end engineering team and then we got one that's just for conversation is it related to our infrastructure team and products and sales they've all got their own little rims or but in the end slack they call and channels but then over in hipchat they actually call them rims but the concepts the same thing it's just the wait for you to take and create little unique rooms or or channels that are for specific types of conversations and those ones can be secured ride that only certain people are in that channel to make them secure private as I think what they call him but only people who are invited into those rooms or channels are allowed to be part of that channel General in in devops we try to discourage not only private channels but also sending a lot of direct messages or private messages because it's counter to sort of the principles behind being open and transparent and if I'm no reaching out to a co-worker to ask him a question unless it really is private or personal that type of Commerce
 Mission needs to be I'm taking place within a common space so that we're sharing that information on word disseminating that across our teams but sometimes that's a bad habit to break but definitely if you need it too if you needed to make it a private room that certainly possible incorporating Bots to chops and using third parties for the more interactive approach to chat apps so based on what you be seeing this 2 years what are some of the questions that you can ask about that will be reliably answer in terms of actually using a bot well that's a good question I think it kind of depends on the way you've got it set up I can tell you how things are at victorops so we use a couple different box actually we use hubach primarily but we've also got a ruby bought named Leda that's running but she bought for the most part lets us find out the
 well he's leverage in a lot of ways but most of the stuff that we use our internal scripts and honestly one of them or even though it's not particularly interesting to our infrastructure the one bought that we use a ton is for our demos so whenever whenever we're giving a demo to somebody who's interested in looking at the drops are using the drops there's one he bought we have running to we can interact with and it's always just designed to sort of give give the user experience some sort of specific experience so we can say we got one command basically trigger a series of events to sort of simulate what it's like when infrastructure breaks and so we know a bunch of services will start failing and then some alerts will come in and somebody will get paid but the demonstration just allows you to go in and say well I as the person who's on call I acknowledge that I'm taking you know taking responsibility for this this problem where I'm at least looking into it so
 acknowledge it and then that'll that'll turn off all the paging across the entire team so you know nobody else is getting woken up in the middle of the night but then there's other aspects of the demo to that just sort of allow you to show show off some of the the features that there's a there's one featuring particular called the transmogrifier that will bring in extra contacts like grass or links to run books and we make it so that in the demo whenever whenever one particular service fails let's say Apache fails over shoebat will see that it has she failed and it'll see what a host Apache was on Sonos the IP address and then it will go ahead and automatically try to restart Apache before it even Pages somebody so I mean your question was there something that always works flawlessly Works to me most of the time it up once you get it set up it works perfectly it's if there's a problem at all it's going to be a problem with
 I'm typically the script is just not quite tweet just right but for us what would like Works awesome and it's kind of fun to watches in the demo how something a break and then I chew bottle actually go out and fix it for you before it even tries to page anybody so not only is it kind of fun and sort of impressive but that's one that we built up in and it works just follow us every time we call them
 something needs to be restarted and then
 yeah it's just an unnecessary option exactly one of the things that we advocate for all the time is to make sure that if you're going to page someone in the middle of the night or anytime really make sure it's something that that person can do so you know they do know how to fix this problem it is an actionable alert and other something they're supposed to do but we've even gone a little bit further and said well if this is something you know pretty simple and in the one you know there's always this one thing I'm going to try first every time this happens why don't we just automate that and what about going to take care of it for us and so that's what that's what team was trying to do and it's actually pretty cool.
 top rated right is it what is a language for this month so he bought is an OJs application and and it's just an open-source thing that you can get time off GitHub and lots and lots of companies will download the original source code in this order modify it for their own you know their own purposes but you can go in and get a hold of it and then you know you just have to make sure you got all the in p.m. I'm just a basic note set up on whatever host it's going to be running on and then as long as those dependencies are there and and he bought ready to go you can you can write any script you want in coffeescript or JavaScript and it should be able to should be able to work with it so no JS but anybody who knows no ji says probably already knew that you know coffeescript is the main copy script and Java Script for the language that uses language is that you would use with it and you mention another but I think that
 Ruby yeah yeah this bodice did you pick it because it's a different language or there's some different functionality you want to take from that but like what is a butt Panorama like sure we simply because it's Ruby and we've got several Ruby developers at the drops and we were just I'm wanting to sort of playing around with you about for a while and and got it to where it was helpful but you know it's more of curiosity let's see what Lita can do and especially since you've got a lot of people who are familiar with Ruby imaveriq drops we thought of that made sense but functionally it'll do basically the same things now the one advantage who bought has over Leta is that it's been around a lot longer and so there's a lot more people contributing to your providing scripts out there where azlita it's definitely grow a growing Community as hasn't quite got to the same place so it just when you go to search
 for certain types of scripts into specific Services you're not going to find as many men and there's another one out there that's also pretty popular called it's called irbid errb. And it is a python. And it's actually pretty cool we haven't tried to use it yet if it drops but I know it's starting to get a lot a lot more traction lot more people are starting to use it it is in Ruby but also it's been a complete rewrite as of about on a 6 to 9 months ago it's the boss been around for a number of years but is this version of the bonds pretty much brand new and it's got a couple things that are different from both you bought Lita the one being that you don't have to restart the bot in order for it to see any new scripts that you would maybe put in so it can just continue to run you don't have to somehow take care of restarting the bottom. That's a huge deal but in some cases it's just it's nice that you don't have to restart it and they can also
 David Self basically from the command line or from its own chat line so you can whenever new update comes out you can update it without battling restarting it but right there from within itself so channels within chatops this is a python one right this is the python run yep yep I think it's earbuds errb. I want to say but yeah those are the three main ones and then there's a there's another one called Yeti by which is a 100 enclosure I think and then the other one I talked about in the book is called Cog but it's not like the others in that it's not a truly a bot as it as more of a framework with a heavy focus on the security side so they have a built-in some functionality that sort of addresses some of the concerns that a lot of folks have had about security and then they also made it so that it's feels a little bit familiar if you are used to using the command
 so you're able to pipe commands together and you know just a lot of the Syntax for operating the the sort of the chatbot portion of it feel very very much like you would expect from a command on some pretty much catering different styles of the programmers are people basically people who are very comfortable working from the command line but also understand or see the value in the benefits of a few more holistic chatops coach
 as an engineer I'm focused on the functionality of my application can users upload cat photos to my app can users see each other's cat photos that are being uploaded I am more focused on building a new features then things like security or error-free code and now I don't have to choose between a new features and things like security code is scope Jax helps JavaScript developers secure their source code as they build applications Jack's analyzes your GitHub repository as you are building an application defined areas of your code that can be improved weather that is a security issue or some kind of error go to Kota scope.com SE daily today to get free usage of codiscope Jack's that's c o d i s c o p e.com SE daily you can get free usage of Jack's on an unlimited number of repositories my job

 bodies being restarted cuz one of the things that I heard in the O'Reilly spot podcast is that but don't have a concept of a 404 so for Telemetry is kind of hard but I'm wondering like if I'm using humor in it gets restarted because somebody had a new functionality what do I see well I wouldn't say that the user experience this is terrible and it's kind of what you would expect of just any application or any app or microservice that isn't running when you're trying to rely on it you know you ask a question in which is basically Running Man and if it doesn't respond right away I'll I'll run a command of just you know it's basically just a peeing so if you bought painting and if it doesn't respond to that then then it's time for me to you know how you'll pull up a terminal and try to get into that supposed to find out it's not so you end up just sort of trouble shooting up just as though it was any other service Pie's party ramp
 structure and if it just needs to be restarted that's a simple as well in most cases it's just as simple as restarting the he bought service which is just an ode service in and once it's up young takes just a couple of seconds for it to come back up and then I'll hop back into my chat tool and try to Ping the bot again and then and then as soon as I get a response I know I know everything's back to normal minimal the amount of time it needs yeah I mean I can't think of any for me it doesn't seem like a terrible experience, just if you think about the bot in terms of it being a you know it's just just another service running on some server somewhere just like Apache or nginx if it's not if it's not working properly you just go in and restart the service say hi to me I've always thought of it as just another another application then if it goes down you can probably get pretty pretty creative you could have you no one Bots sitting on your in your infrastructure that sort of just monitoring all the others
 if it is to text that one's not working and you can go in and try to restart the service so there's some resiliency techniques that you can build in to make sure that your boat's always running or at least has a higher probability of running but the the process of restarting it isn't in my opinion all that terrible for example it's a using humid is it compatible with
 Flagship child in other chat platform Zori or is there a layer that you need to write No it should be ready to go so that especially with you. There are disorder plugins I guess you'd call him I'm not sure what the actual name of them are but it's You'll Go in all of by the but by the way all these Bots have really great instructions on how to install if you just do a Google search for you install cubot you'll find all kinds of stuff and then I'll show you him once you got in the Box established and it's running you can access it from a command line then then you'll have to go go find on GitHub you'll find an adapter basically is what it is for the boss of the be a slack adapter there's a hit chat adapter there's a fire flow talk all the all the ones that are very popular and then you install that adapter and once that same place then the bought and slack or you just you go in and from within the
 chat tool yo tell it what you're trying to do basically and those two will just start talking it's a really simple process I'm probably over complicating it with my description but it's essentially another piece of Open Source that you download from GitHub and I want that set up it's pretty it's pretty straightforward from there that's pretty cool and when working with Bots would you say that you need to know something about artificial intelligence or not necessarily not not at all with these because they are they're strictly just pretty basic inputs and outputs as far as the bot just runs a script based on some variables that you're going to pass into it so if you you use some sort of variable or language that the pot doesn't understand and it's just not going to do anything now I do think that probably in the not-too-distant future mostly because of the the activity around
 a lot of chatbots that are out there their they're not really the same type of box that we're talking about but there's a tons is a whole community of people that are building chatbots for a variety of reasons but I think because of that that push that that activity that sort of you know just there's just a ton of people doing that I think that they are going to start leveraging some of the open and available access into I'm like what's IBM Watson IBM's Watson or some of the other sort of artificial and natural language processors I think that they'll be able to sort of Leverage those tools are leverage those services to make it so that you can start talking to your boss in a much more comfortable and just natural you know style and the pot will be able to understand what what it is you're trying to do and I'll do it for you but I feel like that's still you know where I don't feel like that's going to be happening in the next couple years just because for the most part we really want a strong
 troll over the variables that are going in and I'm I don't trust that you know maybe the boss is picking up what it thinks is a different word just because it doesn't understand my accent or doesn't understand the language that I'm speaking so I do think that that'll happen but I don't think that's anywhere in the very near future
 particular recommendation regarding the language used when working with Chad Ops like some rules like do not use abbreviations or talk like you talk on Snapchat hour, there's lots of people have their own sort of methods that there used to be so when you said language I was thinking at first that you meant like that programming language and of course it started just depends on the body you know where the bottle depend on what language you want you know developed Ruby or python but you're more speaking to just our own language with with the bar. And yeah I think for the most part there's some standardization I mean I can give you a for example within victorops when people are going are being paged the the sort of syntax really that you would use to tell the bot to acknowledge an instant is really just a three-letter you know characters are acronym or shortage I guess I have a c k for ACT which is just
 acknowledge in instant see you type in akan then the incident number and the bot knows what to do with that but that's really up to you as the person who develops the script for internet interacting with victorops you can say you know when I type in act this is the behavior I want to happen but you know even though it is sort of up to you as a developer to change it however you want it there's there certainly sort of a industry standard for some things especially like with an incident management act and resolve those types of things and then if you think about using GitHub for example if you're going to use cubot to access GitHub pretty much the same syntax you would use from the command line to push your code weather that's you know commit or a pull or push or any of those types of things it's going to be the exact same language or the exact same syntax that you would type in your command line you just type it in slack now and the valley
 what does that anybody can see those commands yeah it's it's pretty much like you you're sharing your terminal history so you know it's kind of pair programming or you know just somebody sitting right next to you being able to see the exact commands that you ran your sharing that across everyone on your team so whenever somebody does push you know some sort of commit to a branch maybe you're a new person to the team and you're also not that familiar with GitHub yet you'll see right writing in the conversation you'll see exactly how your teammates are doing it and what the results are so you're able to sort of learn and I get caught up to speed and have the same where in this is everyone else simply by by just putting those actions into the same place where you have conversations about it and earlier you mentioned an example where there's a server that went down and then the the bud just
 no still needs to restart it so I'm wondering are most of the systems that are currently in place and just a list of hard coded instructions like if this happens do this or is there some sort of machine learning more deep learning involved bye bye but systems so the example that I use is is not it's not in kind of machine learning or anything it's really just a I mentioned the feature that that big drops has called the transmogrifier it's really just a rules-based think so we if you think of the service if this than that I'm it's similar idea if something on a certain Hoster service has a certain type of problem then do this this and this and the reason that that that feature even exist the point of it was that for people who wronged call whenever you acknowledge an incident just simply turning you turning off the pager is only step one now there's a hole
 bunch of other things that you have to do you have to start you know logging into servers and checking out logs and I'm pulling up grass and just you know maybe running some commands to check on different Services there's all kinds of things that you do while you're trying to discover what's going on and so we made it so that the the rules engine is transmogrifier thing but can actually do all that stuff automatically for you and if one of those steps happens to be triggerbot to go do something that's as easy as telling the transmogrifier to automatically go pulling this graph or this run book because I would have to go do that manually but that might take me 30 seconds 60 seconds or you know maybe longer to find what it is I'm looking for if the if the service the transmogrifier can just give me all that or it could just tell about to go do something for me that's you know that's a huge win for the person who's on call but it's not technically any kind of AI machine learning but I do think those things
 I just don't think that they're here right right now cuz one of the demos that I saw on velocity was it was about but I think it would be easier to have it in Chatham it involves the it analyzes the locks and then it just says there was a sensitive end and I think it's related to this other incident like the body itself is driving relations between the logs which I thought was pretty cool I think I think I was in that same that same show I remember right I think I was in on that same the same talk which is really cool cuz they were using Alexa and Alexa was able to communicate in with their with their service I'm guessing just over there a pie and quiri some things for the person who was talking to Alexa through a microphone that was in the remote control which yeah totally I mean they even called The Voice offs but it's it's sort of taking Chad Ops and then adding that extra
 essentially just voice to text type of functionality but it makes it for a makes for a really cool experience because you're just talking out loud asking asking questions in a very natural way now I'm sure that you have to ask the questions in a very specific way for the Alexa to even know what you're asking in it just doesn't understand simple simple stuff like that I think is where some of that stuff just doesn't doesn't work as advertised but I know the eventually they'll figure it out and it'll it'll know exactly what you're asking regardless of you know how good we speak a certain language to onboard new employees this is
 one topic that you stress a lot in your book so I was just wondering why is it a better way than having just a wee Kee if a new employee just looking at past chats isn't isn't there a lot of information and it can be overwhelmed or is this organized in some smart way or how have you seen this yeah I think it was going to depend on the company for sure and how large the teams are but I think for the most part now let's say for example you're a new person in a new engineer at victorops we bring you in and course you'll you'll get the standard onboarding we go we go around and meet everybody on your team and introduce yourself and all that kind of thing and then you maybe get a sign somebody to be your mentor to sort of help you understand the infrastructure and how to log into things and that kind of stuff but a big part also the onboarding process is simply to tell people like a lot of conversation
 happened in group chat so it's important that you pay attention and even be a part of those conversations within group within the group chat to land in our example slack and the reason is is that not only other conversations in here but a lot of the commands are too and so all while we do have a Wiki and why we do you know keep a lot of stuff for most everything documented as to how you do it there's there's nothing that can really replace sort of the Hands-On interactiveness in the hands-on experience of watching it all take place within group chat and so it wouldn't be that hard for somebody to go in and just pay attention the conversations as they as they pass through out the day and then very quickly understand that okay here's here's how we get things done around here so you know maybe maybe you're a fully continuous integration type of shop where you you got everything you know your pipeline is perfect but maybe you're not
 there's a lot of lot of places in between those two of those two ends of the spectrum and every company is going to have some some of their own Nuance about how they do technology or how they deliver software what it is whatever it is it they're doing and so by hopping in there and some sort of being part of that conversation you can pick up on that new on so you can see how well this is how we commit and these are the branches that we commit to and then I'm at the end this is the point where the quality people get involved and then you start to understand more about the company culture 2 in wide away so I think you know it's just sort of an extra part of the onboarding process that really can help get people caught up to speed very quickly you have to keep a pretty specific and lot of cases because if you don't think we'll just get really noisy so we for example we used to send all of our GitHub updates into
 are back in and Engineering Channel which is you know where all the engineers talk about I know what's going on is there building and maintaining victorops but because of the frequency of the code commits and all the stuff it just got really really noisy in that room and so people just kind of started actually stopped paying attention to a lot of the conversations in there because it was just so noisy and so what we had to do is decide to put them in in this conversation which grading too much noise and it's actually counterproductive let's create a separate room that's just for coconuts and then whoever is interested in that information they can basically subscribe to that channel but essentially we'll just move everything that's not important to the majority will move doesn't sound space and then whoever's you know expected to pay attention that time supper is interested in that stuff Bay candy and that will happen with a lot of different things you know you'll start off with just like your sales department and then sales can break off into you know lots of other different sort of subbed
 topics that not everybody wants to be a part of her needs to but yeah so it is definitely take some pruning sort of and it's continuous to it's not something you just want to set up and then it's good forever you got definitely come back to and make sure the rooms aren't getting too noisy and one of the things when I was reading about this and like you mentioned now keep keep the rooms very specific where the group's I was like it can be
 Wyoming like to get all this notifications but then at the very end of your book you're like don't worry about this there's a way to tune the notification when you get it just set it up so that you only get notified when certain thing gets mentioned then or things like that yeah one of the I mean a lot of people and then and I know a lot of people who just are not really big fans of using group chat and one of the reasons is because it's just too noisy they can't possibly keep up with that stuff or you know myself like I have a little bit of an OCD about alerts on my phone or unread emails run read no text messages even anytime I see that there is an unread something I just have this like inner desire to to go find out what's on red because maybe it's something somebody's ask me a question or or it's something important I need to know and people like me find can find it to be hard to get anything done if you're always thinking that every notification is important you you can't really focus on one thing and get into that flow so
 why is it that you know the makers of slack and hipchat understand that and they've made it so that you can go in and it's not only subscribe to the channels and rims that you're interested in but also to in the alerts serve a fine tune the alerts just for you and you can even go in and just mute an entire channel so that should never get any alerts for it but you can go in and customize it so it works best for you talk a little bit about the future where the where this is going
 what is your take on the notion of adopting a similar model like Google search where when we're talking with Bots we do it in a very specific way not not enough natural language processing way well I think that's going to be kind of honestly I think that that the the demo that you saw of Alexa at velocity New York I feel like that's essentially demonstrating that we're currently capable of doing that we're currently there if we want to be I put up most people I still think want to you know type in the commands that they want to use with a bot but I feel like that's that's where it's headed I just don't feel like there's a strong push to get there and I had this conversation with someone right after that demonstration of lostine is a sort of intriguing and interesting is that demo was I mean I was certainly impressed I'm just because of how how much basically is is a demonstration about chatops but I also think
 that a lot of people especially in our industry the software industry and sore sore it and general for the most part we're kind of you know quiet lot of introverted type of people in the end we generally would prefer not to talk out loud I think when we're at when we're trying to solve problems with our infrastructure and and if you were an in your you know you have other co-workers nearby you you're all going to be talking to you computers and you know who knows maybe you know your partner across the desk is his computers going to be hearing you and yours going to hearing his I just think that there's some things left kind of unknown about the experience of talking to the boss. I think we all sort of fantasize about something similar to Hal 9000 or to Iron Man's Jarvis or something where we actually have about that we can just you know have a carrier I just a normal conversation with and it'll do exactly what we ask and there's no no room for sort of
 fade or a misunderstanding but I think in the terms of like soccer development and certainly within i t and a lot of people working within the same room together I feel like that's going to be an uncomfortable experience for a lot of people but maybe that's just because that that would be uncomfortable uncomfortable for me and I probably would prefer to continue to type with my bot rather than speak to it yeah that's fine cuz I'm also an open space currently I keep to myself I put my headphones on and I just know I just searched at all day on the computer I don't necessarily talk to people until there's a reason I need to go speak with somebody but if I'm just doing my work I kind of want to just be had sound and and just doing it last question what would you like to see improve in the realm of cherubs well the security aspect is definitely the biggest? On chat out right now especially for the larger more Enterprise people out there they've got
 for good reason they've got concerns with using chat tools like slack because those conversations may contain intellectual property and some sensitive information and in the data for those conversations are not going to be stored on their own servers are stored in the cloud as part of slacks infrastructure and that right there is reason enough by they just won't be able to do it so there's got to be some you know some ways to sort of solve that and then and to be to give atlassian her that they actually came up with hip chat server which I've never use so I don't know functionally you know how well it is yeah it's sad I meant to address that so we can be in on prym chat server so you can have hip chat without using hip chats you know Cloud hosting and there's some open source chat tools that talk about the book to that that you can do the same thing basically host your own internal chat service but there's that part of it in terms of the security and then there's also how do you secure your box so that
 it's only going to run things that it's allowed to run and it's only going to allow specific people to tell it to do those things so the joke I always make is that you wouldn't want your in a front desk person person who answers phones and you know let's in visitors that kind of thing you wouldn't want them accidentally pushing new code to master just because they got curious there's got to be a way for people to sort of be held responsible for certain things and also make sure that if Jason's going to perform a certain action he actually has the authority in the authorization in the no systems clearance all these things actually do that thing and there are some ways around that and there's some some new metal ware in in here by the sword allows you to connect to an ldap or some sort of Access Control service that way you can run some basic security but I think the security part is
 the one that really needs to be solved before chatops really takes off but I see some promise just because they're there are teams that are working on that and there's also some larger Enterprise HP Enterprises a good example I'm some larger companies who are doing shoutouts internally and they've found ways to deal with their own security concerns so I know it's possible I think it's just a challenge for a lot of people right now that the basic way would be if you are a part of a certain group or a channel right yeah I think it's just going to be in most cases are you part of a certain group service Security Group within your ldap so if you're an engineer and you're within the Engineering Group you have control or access to to run certain things but you can also do it on the user level to request a command to the bot
 then the body itself can query a database and saying is a day 9 x group then give her the result like a shot it's not as easy as you're okay that's all that's all yeah I know that you can do that that one way that that's one we can do it but there's in some cases two people are using rather than taking it that far because they don't really have commands that are all that sensitive or could cause problems but they still want to make sure that the person that's running the command is allowed to go do something like Google's two-factor authentication just so that they can make sure that you know somebody isn't running a command that they're not supposed to but we don't necessarily take it to the same level as as using ldap well Jason thank you so much for coming on the show it was great talking to you about Chad Ops

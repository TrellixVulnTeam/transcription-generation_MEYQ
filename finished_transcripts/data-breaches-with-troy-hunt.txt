Transcription: when you hear about massive data breaches like the ones from LinkedIn Myspace or Ashley Madison how can you find out whether your own data was compromised Troy hunt created the website have I been pwned.com to answer this question when a major data breach occurs Troy acquires a copy of the stolen data and provides a safe way for individuals to check if their credentials have been stolen Troy is an expert on data breaches and he works as a regional director at Microsoft our conversation explores passwords iot security stuxnet the dark bizarre world of data breaches it's a really fascinating conversation I enjoyed it a lot before we get to this episode a few quick announcements if you're interested in advertising on software engineering daily send me an email Jeff at software engineering daily.

 Troy Hunt is a regional director at Microsoft and the creator of the site have I been pwned.com Troy welcome to software engineering daily have I been pwned is a website that allows users to check if their email or their username has been compromised in a data breach tell me the story behind starting this project so going back to 20 sitting at do we have the same people in multiple incidents with say the same password or another good example of something like the baby. To break which has password he needs does that actually disclose the password itself which may even be referred to as well and at the time of the well it's it's really interesting that we keep saying the same people I ran over again you know you get this one I didn't say multiple incidents I wonder if if a bee
 who sings the table Trixie have this service would I can go on search and and say their exposure and and a diabetes 152 million record break in 2013 was really the Catalyst for that
 can you explain where you got the data for from the Adobe breach and what put you in this situation where you were doing this type of research lazy the daughter was everywhere in certain incidents an incident like a divey Oromo wrestling in San like Ashley Madison last year the Dinah gets redistributed really really brought late so often it's it's haunted so it's it's out there it's reduced rate of pay to pay it there's no sort of putting the genie back in the bottle if you like I can be really really easy to come by lodgements information like that
 so it's on like Tor sites I guess pastebin other public facing sites like that well I'm an oversleep is peer-to-peer is being redistributed between clients but they'll be links to the Torrance on places like pie Spain out of get rid distributive I Twitter look Amanda had a lynx get redistributed right is there enough okay so let's talk a little bit bad have I been pwned can you explain what the site is for people who don't know yeah look it's really just a. Of breach aggregation service side they are at the moment I think it's been a hundred and twenty something down to breaches in the side so maybe we should just mention is one of them LinkedIn got breached Myspace Cup race when they insecure and it starts it does become a broadly distributed I kind of data my light it into the side and then you got to the site you went to your email address and it says hi you appeared in
 this incident will that incident I probably would have gone change your passwords and all the rest of it and just as a precaution as well I make sure that sites that I particularly sensitive so something like Ashley Madison which can have lost changing packs on the people who are in that. Of Rage I not publicly searchable I see you have to go and verify your identity and then you get a link to your email address and you can see your exposure so there's always a little bit of a challenge for me as well about how do we balance out the usability of the service and love the barrier to entry but also make sure that we respect people's privacy and then not so to put people in a position that could jeopardize them
 so if I search for my email address software engineering daily at gmail.com it will turn up that my account has been breached on LinkedIn but my Ashley Madison account will remain private unless I verify my identity through the service if you had an extra medicine account
 yes hypothetically indeed so these big breaches like companies from Adobe to LinkedIn to Myspace how do these companies typically get breached
 Philip is not sort of I guess one wire that is always the attack Vector if you like but typically we will see risk such as signal injection so this is a really well 9 really well-established risk that's being very comprehensively documented for a couple of decades now yet we say Time and Time and Time Again single injection floors in software a the best Spike software that an organization is built for a full day Ryan specific business purpose always say it consistently in the products of the shelf so we could take you Lisa it in cheap or free form products and that's the problem then is it someone guys at and I get themselves one of these foreign products stand up when I saw it and start collecting use the data and then I just leave it and they never updated when there's any sort of a security patch your other uptight that I should have noticed protective security so single injection is is a really really common one all the time
 not see anything from default credentials on an FTP server through the open FTP through the inside of threats I weigh we might have someone inside the organization that works out metaphorically with
 show sequel injection many people probably have heard that term but may not know exactly what it is can you explain what a sequel injection means yeah I'll give you a really good soda simple examples side you got a website and in the query string of the URL you say something like I D cause one now underneath that some way in the code that the developer said Ike I will when someone goes this website and they say you know widgets? I'd equals one I'm going to now construct a query which says something like Select Staffing widgets way I'd equals one and that one is going to come out of the query string and we gain to build that up in a sequel query and the problem of sickle injection is what tends to happen is in the card somewhere there is a string some way which is defined as something like sex. From widget way I D equals and then I got Castle in the Sky Texas
 it's really use that string and then we got it can cats night on to the end of that strain the ID out of the query string and and this kind of makes sense in in the context of will look what this is. Of your website was going to get this piece of information whack it on the end of the string that the problem is is that if they not actually validating that input and an attack it changes one to something else imagine that they have one and then I put side semicolon to close off the statement and then I say drop type of widgets right shouldn't really simplistic view of it but that would execute this auditory pace of SQL and there are multiple different types of sickle injection attack but in its most basic form you might for example say it mean if we make it a little bit different and say something like I rather not equals one you put in a select statement in the air with slicks the first password out of the Fist table and tries to cost of the password as an integer
 how to spell going to be need to just saw the database throws an exception the web application doesn't handle it very well and it shows that exception in the browser and the exception contains that the value of the password because I have to buy service like mice Krewella lexical 7 I will be very very friendly and tell you exactly what went wrong and when you return that to the web app and then you disclose something internal and a lot of these just boils down to the simple fact that they not using Trammell tries to Cleary's and Olivia Maya programming languages had this construct of parameterisation in at queries way rather than just typing that one and adding it to the end of the string and then the next line down doesn't know what's the Clarion what's the data we have this construct we we can create a query and said look there's going to be a perimeter here and I'm going to pass that primitive through is as a separate object as a separate logical unit of the query itself and you not going to be able to Simply break out of that. Of context and change the structure
 Cleary
 so does this type of Attack lead to even companies like LinkedIn or discoveries where you imagine they have a significant security team that are observing the API things that could result in Sequel injections even companies like LinkedIn or are subject to sequel injection tax are there more sophisticated tax that are leading to data breaches at places like that yes as I said yes to everything so if Festival that there is no real hot items that larger organisations or any more secure than smaller organizations over civista and what we find is that ultimately we end up with with groups of people sitting down writing code it's if it's humans and less humans work for the largest organizations in the world and I've seen some of them in there
 budget organization the world to as well as sitting there working in so the one man chops with it with just sitting there building code on the run so the size of the organisation really doesn't have any influence on that which which is really it's a shame because laundry organization so obviously have better access to resources such as security claims and penetration test isn't tools that can help or my fist they're not really saying that that that changed also that you sent me. That's part of it the other part of it is that we do see most sophisticated attacks in cases where there's a larger value if you like in compromising the organization so I think that's only like Target where Target got compromised tanza magic credit card stolen by virtue of butt of an HVAC supply so the third party that was connected to the network to do the solar heating cooling and everything else but they had enough access rights into the type of organization that
 some actor compromise them and then pivoted around until I got to the somewhere I can grab cats
 okay so given that it is so easy to hack into many of these organs are easy but it happens how do these companies typically respond look up variety wise and then I guess incident response foot for one of them at a time is is really interesting when you look at the Spectrum of of how organizations were so to beehive hit some of them some of them try to cover it up we sing cases Highway organize I should say look we actually thought it was better not to tell anyone yeah you thought it was better for you not for the People lyrics Madonna Bridge so that happens sometimes and of course depending on where you are in the world you may be subject to regulatory requirements Which Wich have mandatory disclosure laws but when you take them I'm talking about so small organizations or a country's outside that the sort of typical Nena Soto bu us Estrella con of regions often the laws were a little bit more relaxed
 and often the propensity for organisations to want to disclose it is not quite the same so we say that on the on the one extreme I guess on the Other Extreme the most positive responses we say we're organization side he's what happened he's what we know he's what we doing to fix it and the quad transparent about it and in reality we saw the same most organizations it's somewhere in between where they don't want us to show their hand too much in terms of explaining what's going on impact because often they doing forensic investigations as well to figure out what on Earth actually happened to that they replication I am compost site we often say them just not quite understanding that the impact on people in there so good example Bay they went tell you how they hatch the passwords and it's important because a lot of people got what I want to know this is more technical people who then understand how good or bad if you like that approach to cook
 graphic storage was that very often organizations and not slowly getting the fact that look disclosing something like that he's not really a security risk in any way that they just kind of in a climb up the corporate face is communicating now he's the press releases he's the mehdi statements that's it basically seem like the more disclosure the better end this is not necessarily an intuitive notion for companies I have seen a talk from you and you discuss this one company where they responded to a massive breach of user accounts by silently forcing all of their users to update their password I didn't say why they just said look up to your password you might want to just do it why doesn't this response makes sense to be honest this was one of the worst responses
 I really don't think it was I think they stuck I think it's this was just an outright ice covering exercise that we do not want people to know that we've had a. Of Rage so we're not going to tell them because their excuse was if we tell people we've had a daughter breaks in the heck is a gun to exploit their accounts faster you know they can to get in and do it now which was just a ridiculous position to type because the reality of it is as soon as his daughter is exposed at people's accounts stocking compromise not necessarily the accounts on the side of the self which wasn't Piggly high-value but the Tigers will take those credentials and algon check Gmail and Facebook and Banks and other places where they have a value and what these guys did by not letting people know that their account was compromised is they left all the lies attack Avenues wide open so if I had a said hi we've been compromised and customers to go alright the penny shoot now I need to think about where ever use my password what
 I'm out of exposed anything that might have been exposed of value on the site itself things like this bites in gender is another soda Paces information that you use for identity theft purposes if I had a sort of said that and individuals than could have gone and mitigate the risk somewhere else it would have been a very different story but in this case I of without a shadow of a doubt convinced that would just trying to look after themselves and other customers
 you mentioned that the public perception of what a hacker is who a hacker is maybe like a guy in a hoodie or somebody from Anonymous these perceptions may not be correct in most cases does the perception of what a hacker is differ from the reality of got some Google Images search and it's just a such a kind of home fights this kind of funny right and that come back I like hoodies and grain strain and got folks mass in binary and stuff flying 11 the screen and this is the perception we get and the reality of it is often very different and it was a really interesting place in the UK last year where I had a very large Telco I'll talk talk go hacked and I forgot hack those statement in the Press with who's detective says yeah and I
 if we go to this very very serious cyber crime incident we think it was rushing Islamic saba jihotties and festival and scaring people like that is a really really scary title say clearly that is sort of trying to set the timing of of how dark and Sinister this is and then it has it all came out in the wash in the following dies and wakes it emerge that it was actually 15 year old kid he was Sheamus in his bedroom because you're asking to be right when he was 15 year old kid hiking stuff and then there was a couple of 16 year old kids and I was just was the reality it was children breaking into stuff in Children of really fit to it breaking the stuff because they curious that got time on my hands I don't really have a sense of social consequence and I can go and download free tools like sequel map and then say, can just go through in and replace light two places they just put in the URL by side guy all the data comes out and that's that's it I infect in that talk I'm doing next
 I am going to this is this is a script and my six-year-old son he's going to show you how to hack a website and pull the daughter out because he knows how to copy and paste and that's about the extent of his hiking trail rest but that's enough what if I did this interview with a guy named Adrian lamo a while ago and he's just really interesting character who's actually the guy that unmasked Chelsea Manning as the the person who was the wikileak ER but before that he was this hacker he was like a hacker for hire well actually not have to retire he would he would just be a friendly hacker he would hack into places like Next Time Warner or Citibank or these positions like back in the 90s I think and he used basically he would just like go to a
 goes and log into a computer there and just click around and find stuff in this is when he was a teenager you didn't even need a terminal it was basically just curiosity and kind of counterintuitive thinking that allowed him to hack into sites I think like another misconceptions that many times you know they don't necessarily even know that much about computer science or software engineering a sustained osub really rudimentary a hammer and everything looks like a nail to them and eventually they find the mail yeah that's that's true and then certainly there's enough information that they are as well for paper very effective doing that one of the other things that we've seen works really well in this sort of hacktivist genre of Hector if you like and then we typically talking young miles sort of like teens or early twenties some of them have a sort of greatest sense of GTO purpose if you like so you know sometimes I generally have
 this desire is that we seen them a very thick of it social engineering as well so really really good at finding up a company eliciting information from them pretending to be the victim to get little bits and pieces of danta I using really creative ways of gaining access the system so it will stay on the one hand I'm conscious that a lot of them done actually chipmunk technical capabilities I on the other hand they can be really resourceful and really creative high school I would have friends that would create the others big fleets of sock puppet accounts and artificial am accounts and just have these networks of multiple identities communicating with one another in order to do stupid pranks and stuff but thinking back if they would have replied that stuff to rudimentary hacking they probably could have gotten
 somebody's Financial credentials or something like that let me talk a little more about the kinds of tools or programming knowledge that a teenager needs to be equipped with or maybe a six-year-old like if you only need copy and paste do you do need copy and paste in conjunction with some other off-the-shelf tools or what do you need in order to hack a site like LinkedIn or Myspace or Ashley Madison I guess festival for all three of those incidents that is not public information on how they took actually happened so we don't know and I'll speak Isis exactly what went down we could certainly speculate but I guess so they getting back to that the question of of had a head of these large online web presence is get hacked a lot of Ace Frehley available Automotive tools I mention sequel map which is extremely powerful accessible online free download Running and there's also a lot of tutorials out there and in the case of something like sequel
 infected Mercury coding course next week I'm going to show you this one of those things you can do with a product like that he's you can say to Google to look into it so Google Duo paying a Google search that retains Ivory particular result often results that the owners of the site and may not one thing found she can do a Google Duo can say something like I give me give me all the URLs for. Gov websites that have? ID equals to a Christian Primary in them and now gunpoint this automated tool at the results and then all this is just found it in the one come on so the one come on can you use Google to find potentially vulnerable sites and actually point the sequel injection tool that a and it's got the Prime Minister Ralph at 3 torr while you're doing that so that you get anonymization as well and once you sort of tile these things together Suddenly It's it's one come on this very easy to prepare that's easy to find on the internet this plenty paper done tutorials on this
 and you said it going and and that's it you know you go outside and play it had said there is actually a vdi side during this very good guys doing a very ineffective attack but he should have sent this text a while so give me outside and play what's running on a man these people that would dealing with that yeah that they're obviously not exactly a mature adults sounds like basically if you create an insecure site and it has some modicum of popularity such that it gets indexed on Google your vulnerability will be found it's not like you can serve hide from it will certainly have to work on the assumption that it will be found and one of the fascinating things about the web is how easy it is to find information which we know her like oh my week we can go and Google sup but how easy it is to find information very specifically around vulnerabilities so if you go and do a Google search for things like that
 Google hacking database which has Google Docs are these carefully crafted Search terms that turn up everything from database backups to password files and also to other things and then more recently one of the things that that's really fast on about the incident in then you can blow O's on this fight is to use chaudin so that's Showdown Shodan. IO and shut-in is a search engine fit inside of things and it's continually crawling in snake crawling through the ipv4 address space and then Port scanning and sign what ports are Ivan what's running on this service and it does things like that you can do an image search which show is screencaps of all the machines that have sciatic pain ovarian save running many of them with Anonymous access and I will then misconfigured remote desktop instances and you scroll through they screen capped in you're saying everything from private webcam through industrial Control Systems where you can then just
 just click the click the image god of the other dates for the details about it see the IP address say the port the typing typing up your end of the day and say or I tape a session in the Navy but control of anything from a Water Filtration plant through to a crematorium she's one of the ones that shine up there and and that is it's just it's by scary and fascinating
 wow okay so I do want to get to the internet of things a little bit later but talking more about these regular old hacks where I'm a hacker and I acquire a payload of usernames and passwords is there a straightforward way to convert that payload to money
 what is a few different ways we say this typically happen in one of the ways and the distance would have popped up a lot recently with the lights of LinkedIn of my spies is the entire data breach gets monetized so we saw a little while back at LinkedIn in particular was was listed up there for about 5 Bitcoin I think it was at the time and I thought I said two and a half Grand in today's money two and a half thousand you at those and that is one of my so you know he was this. So I have it for sale please give me Bitcoin and they believe that gets sold over and over and over again other times it's it's a little bit less direct so we might see people using that started to compromise and account and then I possibly send that spam and they've been charging for their services to its the same span of the times that they might be even more nefarious way when NASA was getting into sort of the identity theft from a friend of mine in in the US just recently had his SIM card stolen and then this is a metaphorically stolen as well with someone had enough information about her possibly from the Outerbridge
 Coda Patelco and pretended to be her and managed to get the number transferred to another provider and so now look up the phone number that I can do things like when I get phone calls from the bank about I you sure you want to transfer this money is a Tacker answering and I like you got for a transfer the money right so it was seeing lots of different mechanisms of monetization at Bay
 wow okay so the story of the phone makes me wonder so I was going to ask if the password is an outdated security security mechanism maybe you can tell me your answer that I'm guessing yes but in any case what about two-factor authentication because I don't know give me your Spiel on on security enter the passwords in two-factor authentication issues there I'm in wanting transwood being an outside of concept it's sort of implies that there is something new with it that replaces the sand and the reality of it is not we don't have a replacement for passwords and as much as some organizations like to climb that I've now got the right solution of the built the thing which will kill passwords it has never happened at probably the closest we've got to that he's having less than by bet your social Logan's so you can go on use your Facebook with Twitter or whatever it to log into it to websites rather than creating user credentials
 so suddenly that it is not a POS I think that we going to need those passwords for a while multi step verification Allure two-factor depending on how you look at it is a really big thing in terms of Pi the security controls that it gives you a Bath & Beyond a password because they even even in the cases we have said is SIM card stolen which could then circumvent sign SMS by the second Factor authentication that is still a lot harder than just needing username or password you know this is no longer an attack of sighing let's take this 360 million Myspace records and just start scanning Google in my spice whatever else the same if we can log on with credentials rats and now there is this other thing that's needed
 but what was saying there is that as a multi step verification becomes more popular there more attacks against it as I even just within the last week at least came out and said look we really need to be moving away from SMS by small step verification you know we need to be moving to things like say wolfy will you have a soft token on your device so it's sort of a continually rapidly evolving Landscaping at the moment the best thing we can do is use strong any passwords which is a really old line because it's it's kind of true Angie's multi-step where it's available and the end on that form appoint as well so I'm not as long strong passwords you're not going to be out of memorize days and everyone that says I can memorize every single password I use in every single site and it's genuinely random and it's long and strong that they're either lying or the right man right now it's one of the two
 are we still need things are password managers so we made last possible 1password will they sort of products which allow you to have one strong unique password no one else knows and then an encrypted khon that every citizen

 these social login to order using Google login we want to cut Social or not I actually have kind of A Treatise where I believe this is actually a reason to let these companies track your location and track your different things on a more regular basis because when your lot when you're attempting a log in to Facebook or Google they are checking your login against an ensemble of different things including your location data do you think that's a reasonable argument
 look up I think that there is probably an unhealthy skepticism about a lot of things at the moment I'm on the way and it clearly one of those nice things people say to get caught paranoid about is tracking so they're very worried that the bank track because Google is and everything in Facebook isn't everything and so on so forth and there is inevitably degree of that I think the question is people got a soda gaikai will it yeah what is what is the realistic impact of that so is it that they they they saying what I have for breakfast in the they knowing deeply personal things about me or is it that I'm getting ads that are just a little bit more Tyler to it to what it is that I do and in all honesty I think it is way more the latter than what it is the former and I appreciate the desire for the conspiracy theories and all the rest of it but when you saw the look on face value inside there is this option here for website to say rather than creating another bad username
 you can use something that you've already got the squad solid where they do do a really good job security with Alexa Google and Facebook as well as opposed to trying to create something new which for most people is going to be a new account with a reuse credential that's then going to be stored with a site that is not going to do as good a job actually store in this information and because it's reused when that's like it's hacked it's going to put the Gmail account at risk as well and it when you said to look at things one of them old kind of balanced perspective I guess like that suddenly it starts to make a lot more sense so I think we will sort of possibly possibly Elsa come to the realization particularly with the younger Generations that have these internet 19th and I never having none of time without internet there's a great of tolerance for tracking and the fact that that your activities are going to be very online Century going to be joined up so I don't think so as as we get more people that have grown up with that and
 is this a have been around for a little bit longer to become a little more custom to it that concern will probably win a bit
 right so we grew up on perhaps half of our lives or 1/3 of our lives with internet and the other half without internet and in that percentage of time where we did not have internet we are also exposed to things like 1984 and Brave New World which we have perhaps over-indexed on and believe in a little more than I feel like those books presaged of time that doesn't seem to be really coming to fruition maybe some elements of it but I digress
 if if a financial institution gets hacked is it a straightforward process for the hacker to drain somebody's bank account
 look as it is sunny variables here in and yeah I'm just so to think for yourself when you doing online banking all the sort of checks and balances and security control think about the time this way a patchy troubled of a seized and Garfunkel for my bank they watching this somehow monitoring what is normal behavior in line I when things go wrong thanks have an enormous array of security controls in place to help protect customers and very often when it goes wrong you know it's it could be painful in the bank so so very good at doing fraud protection and been so the same people that money back if if there's a muffler on their end as well perfect example of my wife had a credit card somehow of times recently I just a credit card number and fraudulent transactions pop-up we learn about it Bank gives money back scenes in Utah business as usual that's why many cases it is pretty pain-free there are other cases of course with things get a little bit notch
 Devon Rex leasing accounts drained of money but usually that's a combination of of bad practices only uses behalf so maybe reuse credentials for example and various different attacks such as theft of Meg Stripes which which unfortunately you guys in the u.s. is a still a little bit too fond of chicken pens best of Beats like that recently we've seen some really ingenious a text for very large amounts of money that I related to Swift so they said it's this banking system that allows you to change of of money across countries and we seen at the tax in the tens of millions of dollars sometimes I which is at those numbers more against the banks themselves than the individuals but it it just sort of guys too shy that they were so again I'm always going to be people out there that have that had the creativeness and the capability
 to work at WISE to expect money
 if there's magstripe attacks I've seen these things where is basically a hacker walks into a convenience store or supermarket and installs a mag-stripe copier reader thingy on top of the pre-existing payment thing so like the place where you swipe your credit card they just big plop additional device on top of it and nobody notices which is a impressum IV Press is not the right where the engineering perspective that's pretty clever little. It's on the cob but then they might combine that with things like secreted cameras in order to capture the pin that's being answered on the card as well and some of them I don't know most effective
 banks have anti skimming devices that that are normally physical control said devices that for example make it difficult to fit a schema over the top of it and attack is just got back I will you just you just moved by so now we going to raise raise up that little and we kind of Traitor more about skimmer just a few weeks ago actually those are really interesting one and I think of some reason it's lame and this this this person's using it they find and the same look I just discovered this have look at this in there in this like really busy P Otts or something and they woke have it to the to the ATM and it looks like a normal itm and my grab the slut we put the card in and I jiggle it until it pops off and there's like an identical one underneath it and this one is obviously just a fraction logic to fit over the top and it's so self-contained the same battery pack and everything in and that's what it is in a 3 I am someone walked by and I'll pick that up the know they'll take all the Cod daughter and and then they go
 wow
 have you looked at stuxnet at all
 so that sucks and it's a really interesting want to know if I guess people listening if they're not aware the background they at least was this is malicious software discovered it messed me up at 2011 which ultimately transpired to be soft way which was designed to impact industrial Control Systems running nuclear uranium enrichment centrifuges I in Iran and these at the popular sentiment is that it's likely is Riley us combined attack which was designed to make the centrifuges Espina de at space that went into which was detrimental Iran's nuclear capabilities and that was really really heavy duty full on what we would call the cyber warfare bunch of a bit of time where it is nation-states using digital exports against another Nation site which is it is probably not unprecedented because it certainly being digit
 welfare in that regard but the sophistication of it was was just amazing and when you saw the rape case they staredowns of how this software actually worked and the fact that had to work across gaps as well to see it's not like you got to show then and you switch fan ukulele you rent in Richmond and are on and you just get this into premises or not not connecting thread of the web which would involve those sorts of other social engineering tricks and then other mechanisms in order to distribute the pilot two systems that I could not do I talk directly to and that is it is it is fascinating and it's also kind of scary as a bit of an insight into into way we going to be hitting this is sort of thing in the Future 2
 yeah and the there was this movie that came out recently I encourage listeners to check it out I don't often recommend movies on this podcast but it's a movie called zero days that's about this stuxnet Fiasco stuck and one of the premises of the movie is that stuxnet laid this foundation for cyberwar this recipe for for cyber-criminals or you know Rogue Nations to follow and is basically so if you can find three or four zero days and coordinate them and you have a giant software team you too can execute a feet on par with stucks that I was watching some music I mean I guess that's true but the way that they presented was was fairly alarmist I felt like
 actually like the watching the movie I actually felt more secure than my perception of before I knew more about stuxnet cuz when I heard about sex and I was like oh my God they're hacking the centrifuges they're blowing up stuff and in real life but when I actually saw the movie and I realize how much engineering had to go into it I realized I actually this is this is about is hard to do as like creating a successful startup seem like actually or did you get the perception that that are systems really are that much more vulnerable maybe you don't need 3 0 days and a huge team of NSA genius hackers I would really like to think that I can you play power plant is much hotter than a side up simply because there are quite a number stops at David have done quite well that's just what the file but I would hate to think of her that many nuclear power plants being a look at it depends on the level that you looking at and when were talking to sound like
 last night and we talking about state-sponsored hacking with huge budget the nsa's got 11 or 12 billion dollars a year with a budget for example of money that kind of level of sophistication is massive and I sort of feel quite comfortable in one regard that it look it's not 15 year old kids sitting at home doing that yet on the other hand having full recognition that there are nice and Stripes that I'm always friendly to the likes of the u.s. in Australia that I developing these capabilities but that is really it an extreme end of the security spice and I'm back at the other end you back at the 15 year old kids hacking into multinational so just on a bad job of protecting their assets and when you look at that level and you look at how bad so much security is online and I mean I see stuff every single day where I just checked my head and go thinking
 that's what scares me a little bit more because I know how bad that's just so much of the wave really is at the moment thing that happened in this sucks that movie where they describe they're talking about stuxnet it's really interesting is the virus the stuxnet virus what it does is it records the data that the centrifuges are giving off when they are acting normally and actually recordes that data and then replays it while the virus is screwing up the centrifuges themselves so just expect that is actually something that totally terrified me cuz I realize wow that is a recipe that you could apply to all kinds of iot hacking in circumstances that are not air-gapped the good type of circumstances you described earlier with iot and that just made me think I know my God these I have these systems are are a disaster
 happen or maybe they're not I would tell me what your impression is of how secure the iot systems that are in place today are what are the big challenges for securing the oncoming iot bright future
 well the reality of it is often a pretty bad and I will give you a couple examples of that one of them I was involved in La this year in fact I was running it at the security class in Norway and part of what I do and they seen these workshops is we look at how you can inspect the way that you're my boyfriend is talking to services and one of the guys in my class has always been spied cuz he went back to his hotel room and he's pulled out the app to control features of his Nissan Leaf so then it doesn't leave his little electronic vehicle very popular and place setting away and he uses that to turn on these heated before it gets in the car pulleys trip history Chickie's battery status you know stuff like this and what he found is that the only means of authentication in MN identification of which vehicle to talk to I was the VIN number and the VIN number is is Festival the thing that is printed in the windscreen at Woodleaf icing of the vehicle
 and second of all it's the thing that you can really really easily in Yuma right so you can just keep incrementing buy one and then you get another vehicle every now and then and he came out of the closet and anxiety was pretty excited we kind of went through and dissect it and went Yep this is actually actually the case you can control features of other vehicles you can mechanically turn things on and off in a car by just simply adding one like this is the level of sophistication can you count yes I kind of have you can control someone else's vehicle and that that's a really good example of just how bad it can be in terms of the ease of finding risks and also the use of exploiting them and then off the back of that what soda made the whole thing was it was we can get Nyssa to do anything about it so I was talking to them very very early on I think I am I am out in the next Dyess pipes in the week after explains I put it was a month later
 so very often you find that these organisations adjust reticent to actually act on some of these races well they didn't think it was a big problem once it was all over the news headlines will invite photos big problem and then I decide what the service but it just sort of guys to shower as well I have how little importance many organisations put on security not just at the point where they building assistance and they said they should be thing about a practically but they even once they nice something is wrong and dustrial companies are becoming technology companies they have to and there's all this pain and friction associated with that we actually had a full episode about car hacking a while ago and that was another terrifying
 the RAC VIN number is not the way to authenticate yourself into a car what about what are the credentials systems for iot are they look anything different than the Paradigm we have now have you're saying we don't have anything better than usernames and passwords is that what we have would wear controlling our assembly line or are printing press or whatever we're controlling with the internet of things will look at you've got more options available when you talking a physical devices as well I mean you could be doing things like he's chewing certificates and then you've got to have the certificate on the Lost otherwise otherwise the connection might be made but like let's just remember where the bar is as well as the stuff that's going to explode hidden things like the nice in case it wasn't that they was wake of an occasional bad password Choice there was no offense ocation that is where the bar is right so we've got to get to the point where people assign hang on a second like this thing
 the arm connecting to the internet they that I care for weather's been gone abilities the cause of bone abilities or even a toilet where we sing own abilities all of these things that are simply client devices talking of the Whip and in that regard it's no different to what we had 20 years ago when it was browsers talking have rights it to pay and in particular particular making his old particular calls and expecting put the responses in a particular style and and now we've got is you've got cases where it look it is in my both fine with the rich Client app it's making HTTP or https request and it's getting Jason back and you know the security price for that is really no different to I'm here with a browser clicking around on links and what we go to remember is that all of that communication from those devices is easy to discover it's easy to manipulate and people will look at it
 yeah it's we're nearing the end of our conversation went talk a little more about data breaches cuz it is the topic that you are what is a topic you are an expert you obviously have have I been pwned which is your pet project in at how how can organizations get better at handling data breaches do do organizations need to be engaging more with the data breach ecosystem what are some techniques that a large organization should keep in mind to proactively be ready for data breaches well one thing is exactly what you said actually protectively be ready because what times to happen is is a data breach always comes as a surprise. Said no one is expecting to wake up and find my daughter like a pie spin but one of the things that's really important is do they actually have the resources available when that happens to it to act act expeditiously and act responsibly and even live
 things like do you actually have the ability to a my loyal customers at the drop of a hat now This Could Be Tamed or even hundreds of millions of people and sending that many miles on a on a sort of emotion devices can actually be really hard that's just one simple example of course the other thing is is actually having the ability to go through and dissect what has actually happened with his incident so yeah I can I can I go through and pull the relevant logs and pull the relevant history to a try and understand what actually happened you know where do they where do they come from how do they get in what did I do once they're in there and it is interesting also to have a look at the Y some organizations are evolving around I think is you put it in guiding with this. Of haca system so for example Amazon and several other very large Plies actively obtaining data breaches going through that and scanning that's against their existing customer base so Amazon has been sending email site
 in the LinkedIn. How you were in the LinkedIn. Average with sign credentials that you used on Amazon as a precautionary measure we've reset your password that plays gun said it again and I find that really interesting because we're talking about mainstream aboveboard companies actively dying in obtaining hacked doctor but in an effort to better protect the customers which I think it is usually positive thing of us in it down in ways that I don't think he's very positive as well but it's that that is a really interesting Trend beautiful impact of your website have I been pwned on the data breach ecosystem
 look at it it's interesting it's probably probably had multiple impact. I think the thing that kind of stands at most to me though is win. Win a data breach does become broadly socialized and people know that it's happened we do see that having downward pressure on the price of the Dodge when it's being sold on black markets and part of the reason for that is that the dancer is most valuable whilst people are still using the same credentials so you have everything about sodas zero hour after an attack were in and then attack it has his daughter every username and password in the presently works on that site I lied proportional going to work on other sites that's really really valuable and then as time goes by people start changing passwords particularly once they see Chris about it and it ends up on a site like haven't been kinda ends up in the news and people guy oh wow like such and such just got hacked wow like a bit of change my password now the value that account
 only goes down and when that happens on mass the value of the I rolled out of reach guys down as well so I would I sort of like the the fact that getting it publicity in this way makes it harder for people to go and exploit the information and then inevitably makes less valuable to them is on sale site close off I'd love to know what you are trying to accomplish with those courses what are the things that you are trying to impart upon the viewers of your courses so I've got and we'll go with my surveys is particular to try and help technology professionals understand how these risks would so there is some very high-level courses for example it's so decide what this is the mechanics of a sequel injection
 and it's consumable in small soda box information at a high level does get very down into daytower it's like okay so you're an ISP. Net developer and your building application this is what your code should look like and more importantly so vulnerable card looks like and even more importantly he is what it actually looks like to exploit it and this is one of the things that I really like him potty and Papal in my microcells in in the workshops around as well where it's like at this is the way we attack actually happens he is had to do it now that you understand it you're going to be a lot more invested in actually protecting a systems and I think that's really important because very often we say people so decide oh yeah and I should be resilient to Sequin jection but never really kind of getting wider such a big thing that's what it do a lot of in these events courses and events right thanks for your time this is been a great conversation I really enjoyed it and I particularly enjoyed preparing
 for this episode videos are super entertaining I love your site it's a great public resource so keep up the great work and thanks for coming on the show awesome thank you very much for the invite

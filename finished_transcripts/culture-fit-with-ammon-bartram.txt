Transcription: culture fit is a term that is used to describe Engineers that have the right personality for a given company in the hiring process lack of cultural fit is a term that is often used to turn away Engineers who are good enough at coding but just don't seem right for the company as today's guest almond Bartram says lack of culture that usually means lack of enthusiasm for what a company does almond is the co-founder of triplebyte a company that is debugging the interviewing process triplebyte has interviewed thousands of Engineers and is discovering which aspects of the current hiring process makes sense and Witcher based on Superstition or distraught tradition we had a great conversation about what culture really means and how to hire effectively I really enjoyed this episode with almond and I hope you do too

I'm at Bartram is the co-founder of triplebyte he's joining the show for the third time on welcome to software engineering daily hello thank you for having me today we're going to talk about culture fit which is a topic that has been discussed a lot in software engineering circles I want to start by explaining a little bit about who you are and what you do around triplebyte people who don't know you near they might not know this stuff so you'll triplebyte is a platform for helping companies do better hiring so talk a little bit about what triplebyte does just for people who have not heard of the product before and explain how the hiring process is inefficient and what triplebyte is doing to try to improve that so basically we were company and we help engineer's find jobs at the company's I answer what we do is apply to us
we interview them and then we introduce them to about 200 companies including Apple Facebook Dropbox on all the way down through you know cruise boat ride in cars and then just a tiny startups that are just a few months old and he's able to do a much better job matching can be found is that the the address to look for actually very pretty significantly but they don't have a great way of telling applicants this and what they have to do is just reject everyone who you know they are not even aware exactly that I know if they different Motor Company so company a might think that you know you really care about you know complexity analysis and anyone who applies who can't talk in depth about you know amortized time complexity engineer
they don't realize that there are you know dozens of other comes out there that will very happily high are great people who you know maybe aren't Souper Salad on unsuspecting office that's what we can do if the all the different strengths and what we see then is that that matching the the offer right at the at the company's goes up by about I 2x so can I get offers after about twice as many interviews as the same companies for the engineers this is really useful so what you do is you centralized the hiring process you are company that focuses on the hiring process and the advantage of getting all of those of have building a company Tyler and hiring where in Des in the past every individual company was doing it's hiring alone but you know I figured you know that you're you're a cloud services company and you also have to figure out hiring that that has in efficiencies for both the company
and for the engineers that are going through the hiring process soap for the engineers that are going through the hiring process you know if you're applying for jobs you typically have some set of requirements do you want out of your job but for most people it's not like I want to work specifically at striper I want to work specifically an Amazon I've got some set of things that I want to be match with a company it's like an online dating site almost you know you don't you don't go after once I mean some people go after one specific person but you would rather go into this pool and be match with somebody based on characteristics that should great the engineers for the company's what you're saying is because you have because you focus on hiring so much you have a lot of insight into some of the proclivities towards error that certain companies had for example unconscious biases like figuring out what are the unconscious biases that occur Wiley in the hiring process is some
you're well suited to because you see so many different data points to overtime you can grind out these biases that are our ever-present what are some of those unconscious biases that affect the hiring process well then when we can without their skills and what you see is that imbalance to the credentials you know Duke o'death where you might expect rights of people who buy Mighty as a group of people who graduated from unknown state school but graduated from MIT and so you know if you you know just say okay Brian only talk to you missing the programmers and yelled at by ascends episode of infecting the process and so you know for a given level of performance companies are
smart likely to hire someone if they have survived a name brand company or name brand school on their resume and so I think I think we're the biggest ones we specialized and it's just you know Finding helping people who are great program to maybe you know how you feel because of present way to work in the country maybe they were there for you don't got any work that defense contractor in and you know Visual Basic say and had an incident with my leg up over the screening process that would not have spoken to them if they didn't have some of our validation this blindness the you're talking in the background blindness are you saying you don't look at resumes you don't look at background at all is there any screening process for people who come through the door I got to the split the first step in the process is for an automated program in quiz but we do when we do things that we do not know we don't we don't even know the name to the top of the screen but we don't know we don't know who they are if they work for you know 20 years or 3 months we don't know you know what's going on at 2
that was in the process of the beginning was it I mean you you did you realize overtime that oh actually looking at a resume actually just causes by us that confounds things you actually just want to test people for Gem a program from the beginning of resumes it's it's pretty abysmal so we have read that going and we decided to try to come up with a process to directly measure scale and so we decide to come to force ourselves to get better at that to totally cut off access to the kindest back. That's okay I like how we like if we know nothing about a candidate you know what's the what's the most accurate way to determine if there are still programmer you write about these high signal and low signal question so once somebody is in the door for an interview and your that you're interviewing them there are questions that can provide a high signal as to whether this person
be a good engineer engineering hire at their also low signal questions where you're going to ask them a question and whether or not the answer correctly it's going to have no impact on whether it'll be a good engineering higher can you give an example of each of these types of questions sure it for now but it's the first depends a lot on what the company is looking for I might I think I just took two companies do look very different scales and so for example of a thesis that they want to see if that this pieces right probably makes sense they have a reasonable cultural desire to hire a chemical Engineers a great rule of thumb is
questions that require a single leaf of insight are very bad brackets and not just because I end up being extremely noisy and so an example of a question like that on this the real question that sometimes is the question is imagine the stairs and a small Step Up 1 Co-op two steps and the question is imagine you're on the end step of the flight of stairs how many unique pads are there are you could you have taken from the bottom step and you know if you think about it..... The answer is the Fibonacci sequence and you can you can protect yourself but if you know it's if you ask him if that question you know the answer and I feel frustrated
will you give it away and there's no signal back a different question that someone might ask you know is I don't know let's say it takes to make these addresses the answer right so it gets stuck on one step you can get a little bit of glue to help move forward but and I can still have chemistry don't get past that point in his later on and so I think you're the second question is far better cuz they're so you can throw a natural how the candidate you know is moving through the process and you know it annoys people get stalked by give me some Clues and not totally invalidate the question I do this rule of thumb about his questions that that can be given away to a question where you have to ask you to feel you have to worry did someone give away this question to the Atkins weekend ahead of time
that's possible right there some a single be no small thing of information smoking or something fuse for you if you said that they could have been told that's going to help them for the answer the question I think it's probably a bad question a better question is a question where the answer the question is you know 45 minutes of programming so there's very little that they got quite a bit done short of prating the program ahead of time to give them an advantage I think at this point most listeners understand the process of triplebyte a bunch of Engineers come through the door you interview them you figure out how to match them with companies is a lot of complexity to this process and we've attacked discussing that in previous episodes where you've been on the show so people could listen back to those so let's zoom in on culture fit because this is for anybody was done and Ferb engineering interviews or a lot of engineering interview she's probably been rejected once or twice for something whether you know it or not that was internally described at that company that rejected you as cold
troll fit what is it term mean or what do companies perceive it to me when I say to somebody else I didn't hire this person because of cultural fit what is the unspoken language that's going on with his head turned actually mean that question so sweet and pretty excited technical screening and Sophia when can they to go through a process to do fail interviews very often that if it's a cultural Reasons I'm in Sarasota. Spotting that we went back and interviewed all companies accept me about what they eat what they look for and what we what we observe is that it's an extremely overloaded term it doesn't mean anyone thing so it means would have the whole grab bag of non technical reasons that a company might want to get to Canada so anything from you know we thought they were an asshole you know you know stuff
will you eat what you want to do for the three specific stuff to you know this company has you know we're bank and we need programmers who care a lot about security and are very security mind in this person was he was a great programmer but they weren't you know it seem like they're going to move fast and break things rather than thinking about security but the interesting thing is that aren't aren't about the differences that's awesome pretty poorly defined on it so I think it's quite useful to dig into and break apart is different parts to talk about each of them separately

 right triplebyte has a post on the blog trouble by blog about how to succeed at conventional engineering interviews at you you know you in this post you basically say your treachery will bite were trying to change the interviewing process but in most job interviews you're going to have to deal with this process if you're an engineer and there are some easy tips that you can follow that will make this process a lot easier even though it's stupid and it's stupid to have to adhere to it that's the way that things work and the number one piece of advice you have is not around learning any specific algorithms are going on Career cop and training yourself is actually be enthusiastic it's thick that's the number one piece of advice you imply that the companies that reject a person for cultural fit 9 times out of 10
 that actually means that person does not have enthusiasm for what the company does and that actually like if you want to classify that as cultural cultural fit that almost sounds like a characteristic of humanity as a culture that's the specific companies just like why would you want to hire somebody who's not enthusiastic you just said they would want to do that yeah I think I think from the point of view of a cab. How you can pass more culture for interviews I think the number one piece of advice is it definitely be enthusiastic right and so you know the answer more precisely Resorts company ahead of time and come up with a list of questions that you think you are excited about that you can ask about to show your excitement and that's green extinct load arbitrary but it actually it actually makes sense right there there's a bunch of flies with it but as a company like you totally do want to hire people who are
 what you do I think that's actually a positive aspect of culture fit is that it's recognizing that there are things other than just flashy technical Brilliance that matter I'm in Sofrito for example imagine as a hiring manager I give to candidates is patently brilliant and you know logic problem you give them you know they will they will crash in seconds and they can you know right the hardest I'll get up with you know but they're a little lazy and unfriendly and you know when your company there a job but they'll probably you know I work 9 to 5 and you know not answer email flowers and not care about the company right and Mackenzie to is a solid programmer right there they're pretty good you know the something of the something some master not up on the other candidate is but they care a lot about your company does and there you know they find it deeply exciting and they have just this great you no work ethic
 Reebok Sandra Padilla and Ian are not sleep don't have to answer right and you're almost certainly the bedroom play at every company and I think anyone who's ever been with that part of it is acknowledged skills outside of of capital billions. No matter the difficulty Ben is coming over how you actually measure those skills in a way that's what you're not being totally destroyed by confounding factors and the way that they connect to the ambiguity of the term cultural fit is cultural fit actually just code for things that are universally true like universally want somebody who is enthusiastic but maybe you don't know how to say that after a technical interview like you can't you can't you have to have a technical interview and your you know somebody who is a candidate has come into your office and they've gone through technical interview and you ever read like well you know they got the question right but I something
 may I don't know if he's a good cultural fit or she's a good cultural fit is this just code for things that are universally true that we don't know how to articulate I think I think it's usually break down to three parts part one I would say is soft skills so it's not that basically everyone cares about right so can we taste ability to work on a team General positive attitude and it kind of about our company does and those are not under under under part two separate part 2 is specific choices that only makes about what traits and white what type of employees they want to have
 that's what this is for example in a company might decide that you don't want some company and its employees to bleed in decision-making and twice once at the store if you know filter for outliers On Believing up the right way to solve a problem is gathered data look at the date. Nicola sturgeon as opposed reporting it from totally product angle or I should have a feeling you'll have to break things right you can do that as would have a specific intent look so they want to buy a store to sort of productive hackers as opposed to other purchase engineering is an example this is this has a particular focus on friendliness
 and you know they will reject people who ever else would hire I just because they're you know only as you know I fix iPad from this rather than 8 out of 10 you know I went to stripe and I did three interviews there in a day one time and I did another one remotely but I got a good picture of the Covenant interface with five or six people there in a day friendliness is certainly a characteristic that I would use to describe all of them and and you know what else to say about that stripe that was an incredibly warm and it said there's something I can't put my finger on that made me really enjoy the visit to their office and I guess you could encapsulated as friendliness it sounds like an underrated or so I should underappreciated element of that company
 yeah interesting it at all because of you know certainly one of the really rising stars in people compare it to Amazon but it said it's so fast so okay but you know now you're talking about differentiating characteristics of these big companies I did I did a Show recently with a guy from Google who have been there from from the early days and you know he was talking about how like I think this is like move fast and break things was not something that was a characteristic of Google like Google is like figure out the example he gave was if there's a problem with the Linux kernel that's causing your Hadoop job to not run you don't write a script that makes the hood Duke job run properly you fix the colonel dog and like at Facebook it would be like figure out some freaking system that runs correctly make sure you can do it in 3 hours break out
 duct tape can you tell it is a totally different so there is certain things that are cultural fit that are specific to companies that are not BS yes and I think the third out of sorts of the 3rd or the third category of things I think I found a culture but he's the kind of guy that just is the pattern matching right so it's not ignoring a the first two categories so soft skills and then specific intent filtrate a company wants to have just does this candidate feel like a Grizzly ride in the password of the rent money future friends with and this is where you see so I lost my back the extra few people at Google about that but that that the decisions in most not take me to is are made in the first 30 seconds right so that's that's what you're seeing just does this person you got call feel like
 PC sites paper wow the worst reinforcing you know by today against people don't look like from using the past by IP pin do you believe that do you think that happens in the end engineering interviews where most of them are decided in the first 30 seconds I think engine ago so yes it goes if yes and I think no one's at 4, so we are really lucky and that most Edgenuity was are Apple still assessments you know you may think someone looks stupid but then they say if they really your problem change your mind
 don't have that is not really a and so in that case yes I believe in yourself respect to look at your own two feet is it making process when you're trying to do to an interview for you know for a sales role or something I think you'll notice that no not all the time but pretty hyped be out that that the thing you're thinking face I can send it but you think at the end it's funny how many times out of all the engineers have interacted with where I just think like a my first impression is prison like this purse is so Dopey and it's like so stupid and he's always eating that stupid sandwich and this person is obviously an idiot and then I interact with them on the level of code or like I talked to them about some systems problem and then and they just like say oh yeah it's you know it's just it's this this is how you solve it I'm like oh wow that's brilliant and my opinion will totally change
 based off of some technical confirmation of the engineers that I encounter the longer the time I spend with them the more they have a chance to expose that side of themselves where they're really smart about something and my opinion of them improves overtime I don't know if there's any correlation of your own experience so you know ahead of time I think about it and it's pretty easy to trick yourself into thinking that you would have done better on the question then you actually probably would you know the reality is that people don't apply and then try to be bad but it's good to stay humble and realize that
 you know there is a super high you know false negative rate it's very you know it is relatively easy to make a smart person look stupid question you know that they haven't thought about and you know one thing that that it was to choose to do hate home projects and then also a longer take home project and look at the difference in quality you know you know you know an hour or two in there on the spot person when they had their you know what time to go to think about it was really quite enlightening just people who we had written off as bad but then turn around and like to really if you don't really impressive but a little work yeah and I feel I think it's some people who are on the interviewing side of things they're interviewing a candidate there's so much power it's not your fault this is like the craving to make somebody slip on a banana peel and just like you know you know you could
 figure out it was a Fibonacci sequence in the stair stepping and I'm sorry you know I know you flew here from Montana but I have to send you home and I hope you had a good time visiting the Bay Area and come back when you're come back when you're when you're a grown up and suck people just want to reject you're looking for reasons to say yes or a no reason to say no like it if you want you want to find a reason to say their goodbyes debugging this process seems like very much a psychological process you know I was looking at you some into the processing you said there's one quote you track what the interviewer is thinking every 5 minutes throughout the interview what does that mean like how do you do that I swear if you was over Google Hangouts
 and as we have beautiful feet on creating a titration tools that that over like every 5 minutes there should I pop out the access for our current document and so will be found that so much more concrete measures of you know progress on a problem and things like that I mean Alexa tap get it took your problem are much better pictures of how they'll do on other music companies but kind of the measure that was interest was was was the last go back to what I said earlier that the technical technical questions the impression the lot over time when I when asking questions so when you put in a check like that it's important because the interviewer realizes they are being examined on a certain axis and now I caused them to consciously counteract that bias
 like they might realize I owe you know I'm being graded my sentiment is being measured every 5 minutes throughout the interview maybe I should be more open to changing my sentiment so maybe there's some like Heisenberg uncertainty like a beneficial Heisenberg uncertainty principle thing that's happening there any reviews appears to be breaking down the skills you looking for and being clear you're saying you're going to judge you know I'll do the thinking there's a question and you know right there and picking out on the scale from 1 to 10 that appears to do so much less much less biased measure of Scottsdale gets back to me so when I think the solution to the to the uncertainty in bias tickling call Jeff it's raining
 who needs to be very precise about exactly what their mention what they mean by culture fit sofa covers to say okay let me care a lot about soft skills. Skills undervalued go to the technical billions in interviews questions before I think it's plausible that so okay so companies that hire company and so companies end up heavily processed toward Attack on Titan good people in order to avoid hiring bad people and they usually do that mostly on technical axis and x axis and I think that's probably right probably cut back in a good 5 10 percentage points on Tech Alexis and then throws make up the difference I see you're still passing number of people on the culture found on side
 Sasuke access significantly lower stripe you could probably just check people for friendliness and then say like okay your friend you've met the friendly quota and then you bring them in the door and stripe has so many different roles whether it's engineering or customers or technical customer success so many different roles you could just do the job matching after they passed the test for friendliness arguably yeah I agree lot with the prosthetic and it also you'll be precise about so the second category right so there's a specific traits that that. You are look for your company so it's just being funny about that I really interesting question is what extent
 what's a good idea right we have all these examples of successful companies that have soda feces about who they want to hire it's actually helpful and I'm not sure I think it's listed as far as I don't have a specific thesis high point being you know it's really hard to find good people sound like and I can find the possession of the majority of companies don't know what their own DNA is like they don't know what is a good person at this company at the negative of it but the negative or the positive raising is what they care about is you know Tech ability and soft skills and they if you know not just hard to find good people and so they could
 not for the narrow the field by saying you know we only want you know people who are extreme out loud in front so we all have to go out and get it to you or you know whatever it is and I'm up in the air about about 4 I think

 well you know my my perspective is basically if you got a if your company has a good product you should just like people who come through the door that either they have a good resume or they show a lot of enthusiasm you let him through the door and doesn't work for triple by probably but you let them design their own hiring process you just say them hate tell me like how old should I rate you right now the bright lights give me because you know some really good hiring advice that I read this is Encore up from a guy named Lauren Hoffman who he writes a lot about startups and hiring in building businesses near it's really interesting but you know you wanted things he always says you hire for for strength not for lack of weakness and I think a lot of the with the engineering hiring process these do with a screen for a lack of weakness or they try they screen for weakness it's like they're looking to detect your weaknesses and like some people have really weird strengths and if you were to be able to expose those
 to the hiring process you be like oh my God you would be perfect for like X random part of our company that we didn't like companies are getting so weird like a good there so many nice companies doing very nice things because of the way that the internet allows for you to scale up even the most Niche products you can find all of your customers for those super nice products so if you got a nice role in a niche company then why would you have a general or you got a bunch of Niche roles in any money why would you have a hiring process that's like peanut butter likes super generalize so I mean I realize it's not a super like scalable or recipe style way to do hiring but I think the best way to hang is like call somebody up that strike up a conversation with them be like okay what are you good at like what you going to come in and do trying to do
 that that's what we're trying to do is solve that problem by getting better ourselves at identifying all those different Niche so there's no she works at a company the problem with taking that approach and what are we saying pulling on standardized and so let's say you know I'm looking at three candidates you know I asked them all you know that one you know you know is great graphics they want to do the demo for me that's doing something no fun thing and you know when the browser and you'll candidate to is how do you decide and how do you sign over that's fair so it's always a week if you then you know you're the first I've just started balls were into it you know and you know it and talk about it inside and subpoena got call and that got call ends up being
 24 the problematic by to see back in and so if you want to give each candidate the option to you know I totally agree. You know not like not like a week this problem is how do you do that in a repeatable standardized way that's taking these sort of the problematic by a sound decision and also a second problem with that is that communication ability to give people a total freeform interview often salesmanship and communication ability on their part ends up dominating the actual technical ability talking about crooked in the past often deal to pitch that work effectively is influences perception more than how Tekken impressive to work actually was that the ultimate sauce scale
 it is soft skills then then sure but if you need if you believe that that both things matter in that and that there young like that you know that the heart still matters as well as like I think the solution is to not have you be totally free form but they have a bunch of different approaches right but different tracks and so you know you have if you know you know a way that your people who are focused and aware you even people who are you know very proud T-Mobile and and then having you know enough enough of those tracks the process of standardized and that's all but the biggest companies are not able to themselves you're talking about this idea of like where you you hot what's a you interview like 5 to 10 mobile Engineers over there like if your
 show me the Tire Guy mobile engineer the way your kind of presenting it is okay you interview 5 or 10 mobile engineers and then you getting a room and you discuss them and you pick the best one from that group of 5 or 10 but my experiences that actually what happens is its ass more of a serial process and you encounter one person and you interview them and then you say okay why are they better than average or are they going to be positive Roi enough and then you say mad the other night and you move on to the next one is it is it more of a serial process or is it more like like what you said you get a pool of candidates and then you get in the room and you discussed and it's like The Apprentice you just choose the best one most most most other places in in the economy hiring is literally just like a one roll you know if you and people and companies have
 make the decision but I think that ends up not being conceptually that different are you still at the other way to put was a little bit busy but in the past is this person you know in the top and percent over some bar you know what other people think they're going to be you know gate Fry Company even though the decision for each individual person is you know I don't know higher rather than to take me to a group it's still at the end of it still I think best to view the hiring process at the price as what are the you know a sword and comparison process an engineering scale
 let's get back to two cultural fit so what happened with Uber Uber you know they were it seems like their strengths are also their weakness their ability to ruthlessly grow fast and it seems like they selected for that in what we would classify as the cultural fit like are you the Relentless Cutthroat Uber engineer who will get it done at all costs that's ended up undercutting the company cuz perhaps it got too much of a concentration that is there some kind of lesson here either for engineers or for companies who are trying to build their culture properly weather weather intentionally whether it makes sense to intentionally screen for certain traits
 and then you know in 10 sleeping for a certain difference is that when you're intentionally screening that means rejecting people who are very strong right so so much and I think we were is a case of that back fireing right so we see you that you know you know Facebook I just let you know if selected for you know you know the Packers and stripe you know slacks for super friendly people Uber select in and that your both allowed them to your skeletal you succeed in the market and overcome the local you know all those things but it's the comeback
 I'm pretty hard and so I think you know what is that Uber messed up by focusing too much on counterfeit honestly right cross you know it's just a set of you know friendly people with good soft skills and did not care so much about selecting for one personality type you know when one of you is that this problem that happened is also a distinction between Uber and Facebook because so Facebook at a certain point like will you stop hacking on everything right like we got the business it's worth it let's just chill out like move fast and have stable infrastructure they changed their cultural messaging Uber I'm not sure if they change the culture messaging like telling people all right let's go let's drink a little bit less let's not be so aggressive these are perhaps like cultural
 Exeter hard for people to change. I think they still very expensive as of a few of these to you know your grass event still out there like maybe that culture could be useful again if they get into flying cars you know there's like a lots of regulations around what can you do in the skies like maybe that will be useful again when it went like maybe first-mover and also like personally I haven't stopped using Uber so it. I mean maybe the jury still out on you know whether or not this company is is really so stricken with with issues or is it do you think it's has ever given this case study enough time to Bear out whether or not this was a mistake that they create this kind of culture well I believe
 what that there was an article last week I believe they they grew substantially I believe more than left last quarter so they are winning in their space I think there's some danger that were being a little bit to Cosmic and thought you brought him up here you know what I meant about you know people who are sexual harassers and like didn't make decisions and not there maybe they were still have the recipe out there but I'm afraid of these problems right and also actually debt-free me at that way like maybe Uber can ameliorate the culture just like Facebook ameliorated the culture to stability maybe if you fire the bad apples you create some examples out of people some scapegoats you
 can retain the aggression of the culture of the unique aggression and find a way to hone that aggression without having the cost of sexual harassment I don't know if I had to bet I would I guess I would still bet that success okay alright some other things I was doing research preparing for this episode just thinking more about triple Diamonds the third interview I've done with you and I'm still kind of understanding what the company does or what the larger mission is and you know what they are you are you planning to scale to other verticals and do you think that this these kinds of hiring by a Seas where there were talking about culture or were talking about technical aspects do these extend to other domains such as law for accounting things like that yeah
 what about I don't have as much experience with Laura or cutting specifically but I think that they are these problems and buys to actually worse in most other fields so you know we're lucky and not programming interviews are still you know three quarters still assessments for someone to come in and told him you know blow away on the scale assessment and overrule stuff I have some friends who are teachers teachers are hired 80% location ability you know what you need for improvement of the best crock entire economy review laser focus on right now but you know if
 in some hypothetical extreme 6s case yeah I would love to expand this to your everything is so much of this data Gathering seems like you're figuring out a way to provide structure to unstructured data cuz I walk into an interview at a company like Google right like I did an interview with Google 3 or 4 years ago and you know Google is as sophisticated as it gets when it comes to hiring and their idea of a data-driven hiring process is like at the end of the hiring the person like writes down some stuff on paper or make baby they're typing throughout that the interview but even then it seems like the data is not very well structured how do you provide structure seems like the best way and this is like pretty far flying would be you record every element of the interview and then you like put it into a neural net and like heaven
 did like that sounds orwellian to some people but I would actually I guess so let's do it like they have not discussed Google Google definitely move the bar. They still process questions they still have you know the majority of engineer's to be impossible to really be rigorous about making to the evidence being asked a question and figures about that you experimenting with the date of recording
 of people who basically your iLive time and so what that means is that you know we have weekly meetings we discuss you know what we're waiting and just got making changes and just the cast for the next 3 months and then go back and see if it correlates with your company's and it's extremely messy complicated process people young people have all kinds of different strengths weaknesses in skills we we put a lot of energy to experimenting with one of the one of the concrete things we can record that are protective of companies
 yeah I overdrive to close but what are some of those things like what are some of the stats for the data points that you've started to track like things that you can eventually plug into the neural net so the simplest ones most productive is just concrete measures of progress so give a person a problem and again it's right making a problem that's more sore than one give Insight spelled out clearly and I just met. Of time and they're obviously I'm going to need to have some sort of you know they got a measure of for simple process quality and we also like recording subjective numbers and objective numbers so the measure of quality right will be you know did they write tests did they you know you know
 you know what to do to to the problems you know this you know that can be changed it will still work for the city sex and refracting some judgement right cuz they're there I can get pregnant you might not do some of those things but in Balance we find people who have got a better process get more check mark people who don't have to measure of progress is just you know how many bees test fast compare we have a subject so do I feel like they ran a professional process after I watch the program for an hour and do I the interview feel like they're productive as I want to put them for an hour and we have those four different numbers that we see you know can plug into you know what are you go to time it so you know we're not using a complicated you know multiplayer no that's for using you know simple linear models these things correlate with doing well
 old actors that so far at the objective measures new universe is always to talk to you and I'm yeah I've got my eye on Triple by side I look forward to more shows as you guys discover more and it's it's so fun to watch because you're attacking this area that's like basically entirely Superstition and just like gradually dissecting out what is BS.
 it's it's it's usually separate yeah just people have people have soda first okay thanks for coming on the show thank you Jeff

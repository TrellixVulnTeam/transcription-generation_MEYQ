Transcription: building and nurturing a developer Community is hard work but it is vital for the growth of a country's technology ecosystem would communities coalesce around programming language is tools or programming methods what follows is a network of conferences meetups and other similar events Juan Pablo buritica VP of engineering at splice has spent the last decade building developer communities in his home country of Colombia and across Latin America as well as running distributed engineering teams he has helped to launch a number of conferences meet up and more recently an online meet up providing Advanced technical information for Native Spanish speakers in today's episode on returns to software engineering daily to speak with Carl Moon Ozzy about the benefits of having a distributed engineering team and hiring developers from developing nations he discusses how Columbia came to have the largest Spanish-speaking JavaScript
did the world and the importance of good communication when building software with a team of developers based around the world

 so fun thank you so much for joining me today on something today in Davie you've been here before just before we begin to see what you doing now you want to show sure I just joined 12 not just recently he's about 6 months ago I joined a company called spice to lead their engineering team last time I was here I was I was working at ride which was a car pulling start up its parent company got acquired to move forward pretty quickly with which flights which is a music software production company we built it's it's similar to say it's somewhere to get help for musicians on. Yeah that's something I would definitely want to talk to you about later but before we get to that your buyer for medium states that you build effective this week
 teams and Latin American communities what does that produce look like and the other one just happens to be what I've specialized my workout right eye I became a software engineer by kind of accident and then I ended up being fighting myself in interview leadership positions word Tech lead positions are management positions and then I eventually Embrace that but the process I assume that you want to know about the weekend starts with the SML communities and how you going to be out doing that I mean I guess my first question would be from your work I do. What would you say are the key ingredients to building and nurturing a successful committal Developers
 it's just leverage local communities in set Serta set role models in places where they can share their knowledge so I've been doing this for about 7 years since I've done any different capacities I started with software compensation organize now 8 events or 9 events in all except for one in New York right where I participated once gorgonize but I hosted the first open source technology conference ever in Columbia that was in 2011 and since then I started a lot of the local work at end up leading to starting several meetups from here from New York mostly focused on being interested in her like replicating a lot of the work when it's also happen in other countries in South America and the Caribbean in Venezuela
 chili so it's been it's been pretty successful in general but there's there's there's just been a combination of things we've done mostly from the state's downwards and also locally so in that process as you're welcome how do you measure the health of a group of over at Greenville, know why the community what things are looking out for
 the things I'm constantly looking out for our
 first of all the the most how many times did the attendance to the to the events I think how fast J's, Columbia sells out is now my my truck right now this year for event to be published are ticket batches and they sold out within the next 10 to 15 minutes and we sold 180 tickets did that matter so that tells me that there's a lot of desire to belong there to attend it's also like it isn't affordable conference but it's still expensive for the region so it is a sign that there's that it is a very healthy local community in doing so what would you say all the challenges of building a community from scratch when you have no kind of place to start in terms of conferences in terms of meetups in terms of culture of having that Developers
 so there's three main challenges but being in a different language arts an additional what's the first one is you need to build an ecosystem and you're actually literally need to build the community so the initial event is usually means breaking a lot of ground finding a venue finding content doing a lot of local marketing and then being consistent I remember that the first the first Bogota Jess meet up at like 5 or 6 at Candy's we we still made it every month on the same date and we kept it being consistent until more people found out about it then it became something constant but they now it's been going for 6 years
 so the first one is is that establishing some regularity it in access to content that the second one which is very much tied into it is finding constant the people are interested in Latin America and I don't know if this relates to other developing nations but finding people who have interesting experiences from software perspective are also interested in Sharing for also all in a position that they their work allows them to talk about what they're doing is extremely hard so unless you have high density of software companies are software experience in in in in your locality you're probably going to have to give a lot of those talks yourself it's one of those things that we that we did a lot of our of the organizers until we motivated a lot more people to join that's the second challenge with our challenge is finding a team a team of volunteers orc organizers were willing to do basically
 free work for those love of the art it's also like the leading the teams volunteers is a little challenging cuz there's no compensation liquid you haven't please you tell the bell I pay you to do this but in an open-source communities there there's no pay so it's it's sometimes hard to find people who are really experience so you have to have to swear like deal with with whatever with whoever it is very interested in very motivated and lastly the majority of content in for software engineering is an English the majority of groundbreaking or very modern contact is written in English so the blog post the talks everything is is it a good she even documentation that makes it hard harder so it has like an extreme difficulty level to any communities that are in Nations that don't have a high population of English speakers
 so this is something you've done for the past 7 years and in that time which language is in terms of programming languages have grown to have more active members as in America Colombia has the largest Spanish-speaking just community in the world at the end of language is also with a quite active membership reciprocity leading we've invested a lot of effort into Oscar is also very common the science skill so delete I'd say the JavaScript other than
 the Java and C sharp which are usually very enterprise Enterprise The Sire languages in in in something it's very strong and that America mostly from an industry desirability JavaScript. I think in there there was a Brazil has a very big Ruby Community Argentina has a very healthy Ruby Community are the Chile Uruguay it is evolving like it is happening in in across the globe with were there were Rubeus there either moving towards go or moving towards rust or at least there is still a lot of Ruby invented paint shops in in development in the region but I think the communities are becoming a little more diversity language that they that they understand I think Peyton is growing and then
 I think I'll tell me the worst specialize in right there so I think Argentina there's a couple of mobile only conferences and meetups Elixir I have seen a couple things are there a lot of interesting functional-programming overall it's it's very broad the interest Retreat we were still haven't gone to specialize its possessor Lisa just probably happen around JavaScript Frameworks cuz there are a lot of a lot of different individual meet up for ever or react or angular or meet you or node so that sang of a mature Community which would relate to and in your color is it when you have more than one meet up of the same language but that specializes in the specific either Tom or cross-section of it it's a sign that that there's enough density for
 enough interest for this specific technology in and that there's that is maturing but you can I think New York has
 probably over at least over 15 JavaScript meetups if if not more so Lobster San Francisco and my boss doesn't have at least more than two was just try to see that in in in the American ain't what I see growing that lady JavaScript this very healthy I think right now we have 12 meetups in Columbia I think we have over 4000
 for $5,000 I know I actually know I think it's around 2800 members in many Gs is around the same that you're probably a little bit more so just in the to make meet us when we have around $6,000 that rotated attendance Joe a blog post you wrote in 2015 and in its you made the argument. Columbia did not have a lack of Engineers but rather a lack of companies with attractive in different cultures why is having a good Indian culture important
 what I found in my empirical experience is that Engineers more than anything are interested in and learning or we're driving by there today but we were of course in Edina in a segment of an industry that is having server Bonanza so we can get to pick and choose who can get to be very picky on where we work out cuz there's enough of work there's enough money going around that I can afford to choose when you look at the region of letting Mike up the majority of industry jobs that are available are too kind trust one enterprise-level Chopper Banks insurance companies very very Enterprise C Level and software development and the second one is
 it's consulting or software software up factories what we call them there there's a lot of Outsourcing and and and near show me where you can see it in the market in the States has a better off shrank and that's why it's called nearshoring right now we're on the same time-zone we're culturally similar he also speak English and we're also cheap in and that's what we thought we were selling outside of a region that that just means that those that's the two options that you have there are companies of course in and now they completely more and more start apps that are either technical in nature or or service-oriented that have interesting
 positions but then we haven't really copied the culture or like healthy cultures have software so we don't develop a lot of communities we don't of course there are exceptions or I know of a company's there's a few companies who I respect an Indian culture level locally but it is not the the norm where there's a lot of respect for the craft or a lot of respect for their contribution or a lot of respect for the process of building software and I think when you're competing right if given an option that you have two identical companies and one respects the craft of software it is in my experience and that's why I have to go for it is more likely that people will choose the one that respects the craft than the one that respects where that offers either a higher salary or different problems
 that comes across with cultures that are very engineering-driven cuz we're probably going to automate a lot of the processes were going to write many things internally and investing in optimizing many workflows rather than just ship a product like build a product or someone else and then ship it and not see it grow or skill so that's that's a very short summary of that very long article so should we didn't say that when companies sometimes complain about having a lack of good Engineers should they look at fixing that couches before say that they are there are no good Engineers because maybe they're not coming to them because they don't think they respect the craft as you have explained
 actually I think some of what the Silicon Valley culture has spread around the world is at his disentitlement towards engineering Talent is affected people believe that they deserve great engineers and the day in just show me your GitHub but our company doesn't contribute back or we have no open source projects are we've never even sponsored $50 for a beat up the attitude is very entitled I was like hey it's because no one wants to work with you is a big problem and if you can't be self aware of the of the fact that people don't want to work for your company and it's not that you can't find them or you can't attract them or there's nothing really compelling what you're offering is the first step recognizing that is the first step towards actually fixing your culture asking for a good hope profile has become almost at fault but then if your candidate and you ask for for the gift card
 well of a of a company and you looked at they have zero open source projects and there's been zero contributions and people are not allowed to do contribution to open source on the time and they said they like they've never there sir like software open source the beaches that use all the technology available but they haven't even invested in their own neighborhood to give back or pay it forward so I took to answer your question I think the first step for people to actually find great talent and be able to nurture insertive recruit is recognize that they are not entitled to Great engineering if they are not didn't. But in order to to attract great Engineers they need to go to be attractive
 spring framework gives developers in environment for building cloud-native projects on December 4th through 7th spring one platform is coming to San Francisco spring one platform is a conference where developers congregate to explore the latest Technologies in the spring ecosystem & Beyond speakers at Spring one platform included Eric Brewer who created the theorem Von Vernon who wrote extensively about domain-driven-design and many thought leaders in the spring ecosystem spring one platform is the Premier conference for those who build deploy and Ron cloud-native software software engineering daily Lister you can sign up with the discount code SE daily 100 and receive $100 off of a spring one platform conference pass while also supporting software engineering daily
 I will also be at Spring one reporting on developments in the cloud native ecosystem I would love to see you there and have a discussion with you join me December 4th thru 7th at the spring one platform conference and use discount code SE daily 100 for $100 off of your conference pass that's SE daily 100 all one word for the promo code thanks to pivotal for organizing spring one platform and for sponsoring software engineering daily
 so what's the experience that you have of creating them coming so developers have you come to have a framework if you like which are they doing is elsewhere can you use as a template for also having that with me just get started as well because last month or two months ago I was going to a salmon. Beyond in Africa and he is a coconut what's it called at least trying to develop the Zambian committed of developers and telling me that that things are fighting hard to do that she had done she have a friend that may be used to help them ministration to grow their I can meet my sponsor
 I do have a recipe I've also been meaning to write this down somewhere and then I'm going to have to do it over the next few weeks but especially seeing that we're talking about this in a puppy become a little puffy but the pie recipes is the following I have something that I personally call my infant fund and its I motivate local people in Latin America to start a Meetup in IA tell them that I will fund the empanadas and the beverages for their first event in addition to that I will give them the following advice first you find a venue that will let you have 10 to 20 people together in an afternoon that is easily accessible to people in in Indy either in the industry after they're going to work it's very important salivating find a place that you want me to buy this food from and help me make it happen second find one or two speakers locally in your community or even
 how to people overseas who may be willing to give remote like Skype talks or hang up talks because that may also be very very attractive to bring some people interested in your meet up.com is very easy to set up sometimes expecially outside of the United States that has a cost sometimes you have to just have a little simple Eventbrite or other kind of event management systems to set it up for the first time to make sure that that you're not committing to something that maybe doesn't develop but finding a place where your people can sign up you can keep their addresses so you can build and use that eventually is important and then that's it that's all you really need to make sure that your first event happens right two speakers are enough make sure that there's content it's relevant that you can try to have a theme then make it happen to go at least 30 days in the future
 open a Twitter account open a Facebook account and just start telling people as much as you can about this there there's like social media in the industry tell your friends don't share if you get 5 people that's a great start because what you have developing is a small study group of people who are interested in the same things and who are willing to free personal time and collaborate then try to get one of those members who attended to help you motivate them to give a talk about something that they're doing at work something that you liked I really have learned more
 about software bite speaking about it and it's very easy if you can cars other people to do the same there's usually something that they've done in the past locally will have any time and then the last part of the recipe is consistency make it happen every month even if only 3 people show up it will either. I think maybe you ready to go but if you're not good enough answer you there there will be at least 5 people who or who will become regulars and you have a study group there and then you can probably start motivating experiment once a month or let's try something different it is it will build if it becomes Dependable if it is the third Wednesday of every month you know that this event will happen even if it rains if there's no power of the people will meet and talk about softer because they like
 I've seen it work more than 20 times with this very remote places in Latin America so I don't see why it can't work in any others this is sort of the recipe that I that I found it I'm in doing so should the person doing it to be prepared as well for the financial cost and I say this because important if you have heard you mention that it took awhile for your promises in Columbia to become profitable so can you speak to the the cost financially of doing such an endeavor
 show me tips are much more affordable than large-scale events it took awhile for Bogota to get some regular income mostly because it's local companies just don't understand. The benefit of community and they they they assume that what they're if they're sponsoring a meet up there immediately going to hire a lot of people and they don't and they just get disappointed and they don't really have a vision by try like if you can't afford it and you're really as invested in your like in a privileged position like I am where I could donate a lot of my time and some of my money towards the cost then do so but at that there's there's a risk right there is why I like small meetups is because they're manageable and you can do it in a very DIY fashion if you can convince a company that has a conference room to loan it to you try to convince her about like hey I want to meet this I want to meet here once a month
 talk to a local bar talk to a local community center that will maybe University try to keep it at zero food that's why I sponsored the first first meet up ever its people people will go in in in in enjoy some food together if you can get your community to chip in that's also you so sometimes I know that in developing nations we don't necessarily either have access to credit to like digital payment methods that's a big problem going to be like that like for supper we can't charge $2 to attendees because not everyone that I think the credit card or debit card credit rating is like 30% of the entire country so it's just we're just leaving a lot of people at what charge of the doors are you like hate there's going to be a doctor to come in and we're going to give you soda or water or something try to keep cost at a minimum of your really you want to invest in it then try to
 try to keep it might as well I don't like using the example of my conferences because I definitely lost a lot of money or not lost invested a lot of money that I never got back but but it took it took five years it was my 5th conference was the first one that was that made
 Petmate money because they were non-profit but it was very different in your van Dyke organizing New York of Empire Terrace it was equal Charlie Robinson great at fundraising but it was very different like it was very straightforward to to sell our sponsorships people really understand the value of it other than just recruiting in Columbia on only until now sound of a permanent sort of sponsor for a venue which was super challenging and if you imagine in the city of 12 million people with a lot of Industry you would expect it to happen faster so I don't want to destroy hopes but I do want to set up the fact that it's difficult and it requires perseveres it's it's intrapreneurship ship which Indian did you do all the work and you're you're just left with the satisfaction that you motivated and you you open spaces for other people but I'm very very proud of what we've done and I haven't done this by myself there soon
 behind everything but it's yet there's no glamour behind Community Building know it by products of your work when communities is that to you gain access to Facebook app developers across the region and a few years ago you gave it to work at Otakon about what time I tried putting $18 to the sweet message and you said doing so will gave your company an advantage why was that so I stayed in in the software industry where there's this drive for diversity in this drive for opening and hiring talented there's all these interests But ultimately building software teams is really really hard
 and the majority of the networks are very very top right there is very popular companies that attract a ton of talent and everyone wants to work for and then the rest probably either less experienced Engineers Junior engineer genuine to neutralize experiences or people who are probably not initially interested in and you are industry like if your bill if your building and insurance start up you need software Engineers but not everyone is excited about insurance so you're going to have to sometimes compromise on on different things and one of the advantages that I were or side effects that I really wasn't planning for because I wasn't planning to become a manager or wear anything of the Year from my kameez was access to a lot a lot of talent
 have people who are passionate about software have probably not have access to great opportunities locally so they don't they're not extremely experienced but very very good. I've been able to hire much faster than I would have normally compete in a different level and also diversify the backgrounds of my oppai tees Coos Bay generally been very Latin American Heavy but culturally you have had people from very diverse socioeconomic backgrounds for very different racial makeup Jenner makeup. It's ultimately yes like for example right now I think five minute for five or six of my engineers at spice are Colombian but they all have some they all come from so many different backgrounds that they had a lot of very interesting experiences to our team in behalf of
 where we come from giving me
 access to people who are not on the radar of large companies where I can help him grow and it does seem out of that they grow get some really great people to work with me but for supper right now I have a flock of Colombian developers that we started with our community of which is like only invite and invite a friend invites you into it and there's a thousand Engineers there there's a thousand Colombian we reach the we're about to reach the slot limit wanted to open to open it up a bit there's a lot of cultural development that we have to do but in general you wouldn't even imagine these people who argue that they're so like in the country
 which specific leaving come from the industry or the government they would never believe that there's a thousand people who are interested or Professionals in South Shores in the same space when it's right there
 so I splice a how does the makeup of your team being sleepy heads how does this affect how we actually engineer and actually do the work that you do everyday so the only thing that that is effective communication it makes communication a little a little more explicit yes we need to overcome it again together like there's we need to use the right channels but I do have one concern the only concern I have in my team is time zone so we work on the Americas Samsung Pacific to to Easter sometimes there's the language barrier and I think in this case at spice we are an American company I do want to build an American team as much as yes I am Latin America and I have a bias or the reunite I still think that I don't think I like I like you a lot too
 this country and I want to I want to figure out how to replicate some of the committee your recruiting stuff that I've done in developing nations and how it maps to under the regions within the United States so that's something that probably in the long-term I would like to to try to see how how I can do but ultimately as long as we communicate really really well and we use a proper channels to communicate like we don't broadcast a lot of information on slack because we have a saying it's like as for gifts and that's like only casual conversation happened since like and then you need to say something important send it by email or have a call if you need if you think that the tone is not coming across properly cuz you may be right in a in a passive-aggressive manner that those things are the only really not the faculty would challenge you have to be very
 conscious of how you're communicating or what you're communicating and where information lives because it seems just get that for free just by being in the same location so you don't have to focus on how you share information that's what companies work located grow after a certain size
 they have a huge Communication Breakdown because once you have 40 people in the same place you can't keep everyone in sink and your entire communication strategy breaks out if you're always conscious of the fact that there's a physical limitation at did you have to commit information to writing and you have to broadcast it and share it it actually makes it easier for you to grow so I think it's been the majority of cases I like having people next to me right I really love the people who I work with and I wish I could have everyone close to me all the time but I think I think it's a
 it's a trait that I'm going to live with

 so over this place and what is your text that and then what kind of changes are you currently texting at the moment comes of engineering challenges
 far are very vanilla that we try to keep it as standard as we can because we are more interested in solving industry challenges then just playing with a rock a lot of interesting Technologies are back into zalgo we've been through math rcto has committed to go for a very long time I think we've been using going production for for very long time he customer review backwards bring me a lot of different so service is there a we use elastic search for some stuff we have on my sequel database that we rely on healthy everything is hosted on AWS
 we have a native app that we actually just rewrote it was a native objective-c in a native C sharp app but we just launched we're about to replace the production installments for Annapolis electric so it uses electronic of the interfaces HTML and CSS and I guess there's a bridge that communicates VR PC to a lot of Michigan sorry gr pasito a lot of those low-level processes and then there's the old Objective C & C sharp code the word slowly going to replace with as much as we can and then our web stock is a mix of angular 1 angular torus E5 in the next day or two and angular 4 to do at the time we would use one or two or the other but I'm very happy to say there's like over the six months we've last six months we've been investing a lot in the interweb sack produced the low.
 from about 6 seconds to under 1 1/2 in the majority of our web slice.com doesn't load that fast yet to put within the next 3 weeks I'm pretty sure it will we were betting on angular mostly because we believe in a lot of the things that that it was set to like early on it and now it's it's pretty green in our in our software so we're going to invest in you as much as we can we believe that way we can give back to the community as well and then and go so let's say I happened to get a job at spikes and I'm basing the UK what's with the onboarding process be like for me and how long would it take in the system but have set up a moment show
 the system that I have set up at the moment is very draft it right I think one of things I haven't been able to invest in a lot yet is more of these are boarding and scaling processes which is one of the reasons why I'm hiring management right but the way it would look like an able to actually look for Angie where she starts she starts in a couple weeks so I am right now planning a 30 in a 60 in a 90-day plan for her so she has your objectives of what she needs to learn about our stock or a product or company at different Massa so you basically you're basically giving a plan of these are things that I would like you to know by certain amount of time you'll be given homework on some of it I'm boarding things that you said we'd like you to research as being a startup that has moved very fast it also means a lot of people who wrote the many other things are not here anymore and we have to do some archaeology
 after eating new I'm bored he's ass archaeologist and his historians software historians the things that are not clear the questions that are not clear for things that are not serious you're probably right you're right in those questions so we can answer them for future employees and it's also as much as you can can help us answer those and that there's a rotation into our support and tour in January 14th which is this site this comes from my
 kitchen background which is basically you you I like doing a rotation around different disciplines to learn to like how some kitchens rotate people through stations and support is how we used to cut the entire company's bracelets not only customer support but it's also if marketing need state where they need to send a new campaign or if they needed to HTML template or we need to look at some mixpanel event that wasn't hiring probably like it that there's there's a a dose of very interesting tasks that are very technical that no one side of engineering team can control and it gives you a great overview of where everything stands Stir of course not by yourself your you go on duty with with one of our Engineers who is experienced who who knows where everything is and you have the support of everyone in the internet with you but you were probably spend there are a couple of weeks until we can decide what product Timor
 product product YouTube you'll be working on or what feature you'll be working on and then you move slowly to that attend about of those meetings and coordinate a lot of those things in addition to that you got to participate in all the technical discussion that we have which are what we do all our of our technical discussions over RFC so we basically every every time one of our team members to do an important engineering change or update or feature their ass to propose to the change to the team in a pull request of a of a technical document that doesn't really need to be very heavy nature but it needs to explain how a certain thing is going to be implemented why the approach is being taken in an indent open opening discussion for a couple of days for the rest of the team to give their opinion ultimately they are responsible for implementing an atlas rcto or or myself see you either a high technical risk group is this risk you should leave people are very independent
 and it will be for that so you get to participate in very deep technical discussions early on and also see the past decisions we've made and this is something we best think that becomes a lot more valuable we don't have it that we have like 15 or 20 Ortiz and some that are still open something you haven't really paid a lot of tension on but there it's an interesting insight into how we how we work so you got to you got to see that from day one as the following to that question as well when would you say is the best time and they give it was Korea to join a remote and everything so I can put my case I would have been a 1/4 for the lost you so would you say that offer a year is it is a good time or maybe I should wait a bit longer or is that no time to join a team North 40 in your opinion
 it depends how the supporting structure that you're that your company has I prefer not to bring it to ride my my a couple of Junior and juniors why are you tired the hot people locally to support them who could they could go work at least 3 times a week or two times a week and they can have guidance and not feel lonely so it really depends on on that I am not a fan of bringing it experienced Engineers into very heavy remote cultures because those are very least expect a lot of self-management and self-discipline and everybody to sort of communicate really really well and sometimes you're just not
 either you still or don't have the expectation set on how those things work and it may be may be a disservice to your I think it's just unfair to expect from a height weight of couple of years until I work work for the team and really got in a sense of myself and how I work probably start trying to get like a hybrid Road where I can work from home at least once or twice a week before I really I really moved to a tour or fully remote position there's so many
 Unwritten rules about companies especially companies that are moving super fast at participating and being completely immersed in all these things and I think it's very very important then because I choose you out like I'm fine with not but not be used with all this thing is is useful but if not and you make the you have The Misfortune of joining a company that may not be a hundred percent remoter very remote friendly you may just feel either isolated or be excluded from important information in that just frustrating
 and I don't know print actually what's than is the process by which a splice you come to decisions in which all your engineers remote and remote for including that should be off being foolish about as you and Matt's and then other leaders are making choices of options and their matches
 okay so people who feel included in decisions it is generally specifically about hiring or about how we work with me technical to see if I got to go about your daily duties and weekly and monthly kind of Spence I guess as well
 look up so we we open spaces so that there's there's two kinds of our communication there is a Porsche communication the poor communication right just like in systems I expect from more the senior or more experience Engineers to be able to Bubble Up information so that I don't have to go quite yet and that's part of it so that that is not a part of them feeling included I expect that the entire team is bringing up information as soon as it goes I of course have spaces for them like my regular one wants where do I find I started doing my check and make sure that everything is is working well for everyone but everyone is expected to keep they are piers in the engineering team up-to-date the things that are going to try to so but I will try to do if its tactical decisions that's how we use erc's if it's project updates we have sometimes stand-ups depending on the size of teamwork was running theme
 set ups or emails or just different mechanisms to make sure that everyone knows whether it is in regards to me keeping everyone included every 4 to 6 weeks I have an engineering staff meeting where are you sure to share a lot of the information about where the company is out with a couple he's going where our team is out where a team is going open the the questions for of open questions of the team in addition to that we have a biweekly or weekly town hall for the entire company so that's where the entire team gets to see where we're at it's a company how are progressing who is hired was coming aboard just have regular updates of what's going on we have engineering update product update a business update locking up date and then we just end the call with every week every office letting one of our team members update so the New York says something and then everyone who's remote say something about their day or what they're doing to the weekend that's her stuff
 and finally we organize our our our technical teams in what we call it working groups these are more disciplinary so we have to fart front end working group in the back and working group and the Cure working group of these these have regular either weekly or bi-weekly meetings that are more around specific problems to to the team so the back in time we talk about specific either a pH changes or database discs are growing or elasticsearch is being difficult to be talking about performance or updates were verifications or or that's what they look very assertive maintenance-related and same for QA then we have we open those places for people to give their opinions about our existence tragedy their concerns think that we should really solve it and enjoying your level and then Matt and I are involved in all those a different layers I think not covers a lot more of those specific technical needs and he guides the team with updates
 the markets in a more of the people end but that's that's how we ensure that we have those faces and I think as we grow we're not through that many right now but as we grow a lot of these things are going to have to be committed more into written medium become a little bit more synchronous we had we haven't had that big of a challenge with would you say is the current states of the Latin American Tech ecosystem
 I would say it's rough I think it's nascent but it's rough and I also I think it's very difficult
 to group the entire region as a whole because the local Dynamics have a huge impact on on the maturity of each ecosystem I think Argentina is particularly Argentina and Chile are particularly very Advanced culturally and technologically I think Argentina very very different than I've always had a very different cultural
 set of sense of self that the rest of Latin America are you can see that in a lot of very creative approaches to stick Knology or more music which is a Latin American eBay has huge office is there and it is just had a huge impact of the reason that they survived it, boo and in a lot of the investment there is very visible Chile had a pedicure eats governmental program government program that's called start of chili for the just invest bunch of money and they're bringing is not just local but also International that's brought a lot of external expertise it's changed the mentality of Chileans is how their personality and I think it's it's been really interesting Brazil Brazil is a continent on its own
 how to make a very large population in two very different language that have a lot of very there are very assertive developed developing Nation one of the largest economies to the world show Columbia Columbia is moving forward a lot of the programs that the government is trying to find or Finance for Less intrapreneurship driven more infrastructural I think we like a lot of infrastructure as far as like our mail system doesn't work so you really can't have a successful should've delivery services and dark history of money laundering money transactions that prevented just requires us to have a lot of difficulties around moving money and that just makes local
 companies it has a lot of obstacles for local companies to transact online and in general there's too much focus in exporting labor right I think it's too convenient for companies to hire services near Shoring and because it's more affordable and cheaper and it makes so much sense in but we're just on the wrong end of that I think it may be a short-term but answer for a lot of people quote for those companies we're not investing a lot of deep technical knowledge and has lost a lot of talented lost a lot of town and unfortunately I think I know a little bit less about through as well I wouldn't believe you and it would but I'm sure the cops I've seen very similar patterns of nearshoring or offshore writing a lot of software factories and less creative arts an interesting pattern and it is there's a lot of social entrepreneurship which is
 and I see a lot more interested in products that have deeper impact social impact then but comes generally from the from the valley
 Mexico a majority of its talented leaves to the Bay Area but they also have a very very different culture approach Thornton lodging it's the great products come come from for Mexico and in general Central America is it is similar position to probably Columbia hour or where they were that there's just a lot of Outsourcing I think one of the patterns that I would like to
 break away from is the what I call what is it how we called the tropical ization of Silicon Valley which is basically taking validate validated models this is models and I just rebuilding them locally so there was a local group oh and there's a local Uber or there's a local seamless there's a local SoulCycle there's a local classifieds there's a local everything and it makes a lot of sense because someone else if there is can build a technology improve the path but at least nothing
 to the talent and just a lot of money to those who call be it's brilliant from a business perspective it works but it's just it's just something that I don't like about it I interviewed a guy code on Christopher Charlotte Florida and he has a good deep knowledge in the Middle East and he said that sometimes it is good to have those copycats because once they grow and maybe have a big IPO like can in the internet and the Beast those a company chords to. Com which was Amazon them to be switched over see some differences with original setting but when Amazon for the company this year. That leaves more developers in who knows who they need a company and starch are smaller companies and as a result that leads to more talent and mold growth and more sharing of Sanitation I mean do you think maybe sometimes coping is a good idea
 I think it's good to learn I don't completely hate it but I think it's
 the little company that had exits at Easton Columbus that I know of have not left anywhere else other than the founders they're really have it so that their the cultural since there's no competition that end the local investors really don't know a lot of about the better practices of investing in welding you all your employees should be really well that's it and they should thank you want this to him before it really hasn't happened I don't want to talk about any other country cuz I don't know a lot more about it but I haven't seen anything left behind because usually that the founders here are not really tactical they're usually business people who saw the idea that they hired engineers local 3 just pay them for it have terrible business practices terrible engineering cultures they sell the company they exit
 but that's it so there's there's no like the difference in in in healthy ecosystems is that founded in can you please are usually technical or they know a lot about like that they come from Silver Star backgrounds where they've seen the the cycle before and they they they become when they exit their becoming Masters and they found again and they do that I have to see that to Call Me Maybe maybe we haven't had enough Cycles but I've seen people who have exited
 that's it I want to be proven wrong I want to believe that it's possible I just haven't seen it and maybe it's just going to take a lot longer which is a want to meet up for providing Advance 10 conversion Spanish what problem are you hoping to solve with your meetups online
 so there's four specific problems and trying to saw one is that there is no access to very recent or bleeding edge content about technical knowledge were there its software engineering software design software architecture design in general UI ux visual design and
 fentanyl in other disciplines there's not a lot of bleeding edge content in Spanish accessible so I'm trying to bridge the gap a little bit there I I don't think that that it's a sustainable pass for Black we're not in a great spot to learn to speak English in the regional everyone so at least I think if people become interested they probably can break the barriers easier if they if they if they see what's possible without their second is the density problem as much as we can have a healthy JavaScript meet up in Columbia in the Amazons there's probably one but you let this year there's probably one or two people struggling also don't want to be insensitive but there's probably less people who can have this experience who who who are also at a place where they can share it so bye
 by starting Carla I think that we can increase accessibility to people who don't have any local resources as far as this I think finally it's the actually not only to local experience but also to break down towel or to bridge the gap of experience there's not a lot of people who are encouraged to share their knowledge at work so we have great we have great companies probably backs that have super interesting challenges of how to solve a specific problems but employees are not encouraged sure and there's not a cultural sharing experience even if it's not business-critical or very specific about like it's an intellectual property so hopefully we can we can expose a little bit more that excrete production level experience to other people and then I think finally setting what role models we're used to seeing people from other cultures all other cultures
 teachers it ain't it's it's it's probably further to to see yourself if you see this Silicon Valley engineer who has a degree in computer science and stand for it works for Google and has been super successful and relating to that experiences a lot this much further than seeing someone who looks like you who speaks like you who likes very similar things like you and who is also has saw the very difficult or has encountered very interesting experiences and I think it's
 it's something that we're missing cuz even if you she like international events including I'm not going to deny Jay-Z of having people from developed countries come to talk to us come to teach to us and there's this colonial aspect that I feel very uncomfortable by this may sound rough but by bringing white people to teach us I don't think it's disabled I think we have to we have to do this for ourselves a little bit more and maybe at some point we're we're leading Industries right now those are the four the four challenges that that I would really like to at least I don't think I can sell them but I move them a little forward that Debbie Debbie, and since you started to meet up what's been the response from the community and the developers who have signed up each month
 it's been slowly growing of course wish it was much larger is right like but but but I think I don't remember but it's the first trailer has over 1500 use 1500 use that's that's much more impact that we could have on any local meet up so it's it's very positive or Steady Rollin I think we've had 5 episodes so far and that's 15 speakers but now those videos are published know we're starting to publish individual videos of each talk we had some great talks we've had some Okotoks but the cool thing is it all of them have been in Spanish of advanced technical knowledge and I think it'll continue to grow in the same way that we've grown or Local Natives it'll take some time as people get to know us and we're also
 moving away from the Columbian specific region this is aimed at towards anyone in Spanish speaking countries it is at a different time zone than Spain trouble you so difficult there were still recording the content and it is available to everyone so hopefully it'll it'll pick up more thank you so much for one and thank you again for coming and so on we look for to see if I can see thank you so much for your time it's been fantastic you've had some great great questions and I really appreciate the effort invested in this thank you thank you

Transcription: 10 years ago building a highly scalable image delivery service would have required millions of dollars and upfront cost and hours of work configuring Hardware server infrastructure today it is possible to bootstrap this type of service with minimal investment today's episode is about building a Content delivery Network or a CDN for images and video my guess is eat I lock on the CEO of cloudinary and cloudinary story is the subject of today's episode we discussed cloudinary early product infrastructure how they are protected it and how they evolved as a company sense then we also talk in detail about the Venture Capital what landscape of Silicon Valley today and how to strategize about raising money full disclosure cloudinary is a sponsor of software engineering daily

Com SE daily now let's get back to this episode
Utah Johann is the CEO of cloudinary a service that provides a back-end for image storage image manipulation and image delivery eat I welcome to software engineering daily they just want to meet at the end of 2011 when cloudinary was getting started what was the initial vision for the product
don't let me give you a little bit of a backstory for basically so three founders myself down enough friends long time friends over from 20 years ago me back when he was okay and the belt I think what's a full use before you started cloud in her me and sour we're working on Venture was something machine learning cool stuff about music rogation into Financial sales we we we actually started part I'm working on on on on Salton Sea shop we were nowhere Let's help other intrapreneurs like us build their own product and it's a really small being so we loved working early stage guys helping these guys actually get their product up and running any tune turn out to be our or full-time job we got another job or third friend and then
I found one board but basically you know really small team will always 6 7 8 software developers helping entrepreneurs from scratch right from the napkin stage or two to get that up and running
 we love that we're good at its end we actually helped him in like 4 years this team to six seven people we helps / 3 startup companies build their product into ant from scratch and we learned a lot during the process in in one of those he will learn is that the tutu tutu you don't seem to really get product out there fast good solid product out there you really need to focus on the other the core of your product rather than building for some amazing at identifying all the extra stuff that is out there that we do not want to reconfirm it from scratch so if you don't build your own Linux software longer use Google analytics or mixed battles you use New Relic you don't feel your I don't know you real-time communication stuff you use pubnub or push you or or or Firebase
 and I think that that's really was interesting that that one day Nadal just looked at our infrastructure by the interest rate that we had in place built and placed because we're working a lot of projects it's so common stuff came to get in there but in a way here for us. This is something that is common for every startup out there so why is a solution for that end in one of these areas was looking at all the stuff that we've been building and say hey there this is awful I wish it was some good solution for that
 because I got to go talk to you you build what you need at the moment but we needed we can do a lot more but but the thing is that that look at it over there I think part of it is it is so some commonalities in and it took us a little while to mean that but but we name that images media in general but mostly we spend a lot of time handling images uploading stuff when they're normalizing that story that is backing up all the housekeeping behind that tagging difference fast Luke ratings and work on your website so so we said hey this is this is our issue I'm glad you sold out issue for us and consultancy shops you know customers
 it will be back for ourselves and you know we feel that by by chance helps other people as well then that's awesome you know if other developers would like to use that that's great and this is how we got started okay so you accidentally stumbled upon an idea that other people weren't working on and there were other companies that are there are always have been well not always been a long time there been you know CDN there've been companies that handle images to handle some subset of the problems that cloudinary we ended up handling why weren't those companies that are now cloudinary competitors why weren't those companies solving the the other problems that you ended up arguing with cloudinary
 what question and I was just getting started which was a great you know entry-level CDL if you can use to speed up some some some work use imagemagick because this is what you use when you want to manipulate images and that's a hassle to install of that was I don't know how to adjust remind school early days of canceling it out of its development computer and that this is what you would have been using like we we we are we we love ruby-on-rails when I use q u wave Jam to actually upload stuff because this is how you and this is this is how we would have done stuff so you do use all these existing solution so some of them are our actual companies managed solution such as a city and what you can build your own City and that that's not something you can use it
 Kathleen oldies music from scratch loss Solutions usually it means just bringing in the existing stuff and in and do that yourself manually I think I know keep in mind that every company out there has images right every website has tons of images that that's your stage left your graphic design images videos everybody has a solution in place so I'm not sure that the people realize that that this is
 it's a huge phone right there be so busy now so I can soft rocket science you can build your own infrastructure to manage you really just you do realize you had fun once you start to scale up but then again you are wasting time I wish you was a solution that does all the basic things that I need with images just make it you know I would have I would have seen a lot of cool too. I don't care where the supposed to be images what format of the energy is I want to just getting out there what are the common problems that web developers have when they're trying to serve images
 so I think the different type of solutions images come from you have a social website that date that you have lots of user-generated content by people are uploading stuff and then there is just it it's it's it's it's better off of having Jam images uploaded different formats different sizes about that are Peaks according to what not so you have scalability stop that you need to handle in the house right so if you have news website you have your own continentalism play say they are anyway downloading. From a third-party maybe buying photos and they need to upload that to somewhere and they have their own process and how to make sure that the Right image images get on top you won't even search party so if you want any, so we can you are bringing in tons of photos usually from third-party so that's again that scale existing Sewer Authority in Port everything over and then each and every company has
 its own flow managing the images in house usually it's something about you know our Direction maybe getting your logo on the images approving the images scrapping bath and stuff like that and then it's you know once you have all the images in place he passed all of your if they are you got it on your system they look okay so they just want you to Showcase no just a technical matter of getting them out there on your different devices right you want them on their website or application process of other consideration that responsive design company has its own requirements but he's basically take that deliver just as fast as possible so you know that there are different formats different browser suppose different image formats nowadays and anyone that they even shut off you must correctly anyone that deliver it so with City and salt
 got to stop at the end of the road right so there's things here there's one there's the fact that we are consuming images in a different way today because we have different screen sizes for half of the standards for design have gone up so people at uq you simply cannot have some an image that is the wrong size on the screen at your your cut customer will navigate away from the website immediately cuz they won't trust you cuz you don't have to design and then on the other side there's the fact that there are more developers than ever and solving the problems of developers has become a quite a big business and that it sounds to me like Cloud nariz vision is kind of at the intersection of those two things it's like you've got changing consumer needs and you got an increase in in developers and the developers need higher level API that are more well-organized to
 to solve their image problems would you say that's accurate it is accurate sand in these amazing infrastructure behind the scenes if we can use to build a pond and build really amazing Starbucks right you still there no unicorns out there really really amazing Solutions and the amazing things you can do that with with less resources that you can have from it off images specifically so just heading to that the equations that you just are really part of your core business right you you you you you sell a product wanted to look good but then again just getting the images out there the bits and bytes and making them a computer good it's just something that is very, just want that to happen anyways and and we see that the the recent lot of know how they're so I really
 count the website that I I look at images images are really optimize it's either delivered the wrong size or just not talking like saying stuff like a web key formats people out there it's amazing you should use that that's a 30% reduction you were human sized just out of the bath for Chrome browsers in Android devices that people do not know that and it's it's it's it's it's it's something to learn so nice to come so bad that you can bring all that snow house into an easy easy to use interface something that people can use something that they want to use and do that at the affordable level right that they can you actually use that make economical sense then then then we have a winner elaborated on the business case of cloudinary and I really want to come back that's interesting discussion but given that this conversation about software engineering let's talk about engineering so tell me about the first architecture of cloudinary
 it's a it's a good question and then any question let let let let me let me there so before I answer that one one interesting thing about clown or so tell me what is a bootstrap company right it's probably have so nowadays we have $100,000 sign up for the service we have 3000 ping customer something like that we were working with everywhere between the coolest thought of sand in Fortune 500 companies two companies profitable it's growing we're doing really well we loved it and he said that it's a hundred percent so we grew the company from what without getting an external points this means that that the product sold itself and fuel the are croaks and get there there are
 there's a certain mindset for a blunt wrap Company by so-so-so architecture that that was a question so so just keep in mind that we knew what an architecture highly scalable architecture for such a solution should look like having said that go with the blue stripe way it mean starting smaller in growing from Derek so we talking about canarias always has been so Ruby on Rails for our back and infrastructure and then we use a double yes that's our you know call Solutions over again first infrastructure couple of ec2 instances elb classical balancing and then you know nginx trivial ruby-on-rails is back and it was basically a couple of servers online and for again early stage we grew with our with our customers so when you have
 as I was saying I highly scalable conference what you look like it will we raining but it's what we saw the really smoke from their turkey and the engineering practices that fall from a philosophy of bootstrapping but to go deeper into the the engineering side of things first like you said used in genetics in the first architecture I'm pretty sure you still use nginx today so for listeners who have no experience with nginx but have heard of it a lot like weed there's there's been a number of episodes in software engineering daily wear engine ex has been mentioned but we haven't had any episodes where it's been discussed in depth so discuss engine acts like what is it and why did you use it in the first architecture platinaire E help calling Saul my rcpo and good friend
 help with that but let me just say that so so and again in the next life Waits amazing web server Works tremendously well so we can both move your radio so we have the most Trails there passenger just running the resources behind the scenes and he said that you know has someone that work with a battery in the past just a lightweight installation pool product that still wasn't replaced in the last 4 years of are growing so that there's a little bit of flexibility in weather capabilities and just piece of white over there is it easy to Solebury configurable but other than that
 help child... That's where our next together with Amazon S3 and AWS Cloud front so how did those different Technologies interact
 so
 what's the beginning writer. There are a few different components for for for a service that the managers you were assets right you have unwanted you were uploading you sucks you need to take care of the uploading stuff needs to go to storage and then there is very rich set of a p I took it as a concept of ppis you can you can you can use the whole solution rights act like I'm going to listen to design some like that lots of different solutions out there but you have a very wide Richey AP I said use whatever you want from the service you want to use the service into and it's really easy. That's a common use case against a lot of cold out. Seen a lot of cold download stuff the new stuff we have a good week old world base transformation account which is really cool you just want you to your door again mentioned our Direction cropping stuff a station based on TV station over releasement in and you get that soap
 you have a very full Rich API Larry can just drill down then you can manage things separately or your own having said that there was also completely wide for the solution so this was something that again something interesting while this was maybe initially supposed to be a complete an API that that you can use for your own Solutions
 you obviously have a management Council Rock you want to login you want to see what your solution is all about some statistics about the service error reporting stuff like that and he said that we added to manager images just take a look see what your images are actually doing which was pretty cool because usually developers you don't really know what's going on what what what what you just were uploaded or not so seeing that graphically going to your console seeing your the latest upload images you got a lot of things I need you to death and this actually group that we saw you behind the scenes again usually built on top or only the I so you can build your own you want but then again you have you wanted for that as well and then them. What are the components of the actual transformational manipulations of the images right so you uploaded image you want that's stored normalized some process happens they are so the image is actually stored according to your
 exact specs on a user may have uploaded a huge political is SLR but you don't really need this or 30 megapixels in it right maybe we'll be able to storage safe on your requirements Works faster and easier so
 2011 you know you got this back in bills and I was he really a product for developers and well not entirely for developers but many of the development of the people who are using our developers and since you have API requirements for all those developers you know you need to serve people who are using PHP or rails or Django and then today there are even more api's that they will be using what are the challenges of building api's and Integrations for all of these different platforms that want to be able to use your service
 great question in a struggle for us so so are you said that that most people develop recetas de Leon are we see more people just using that big because again using that for their own in concert was great to look from the side and see what people are acting using the marketing people are using that because you can suddenly take imagens do also so if I don't know what contains for marketing wise or lots of really cool stuff it just you don't have it you're basically imagination was great but it was a hundred percent for developers it was all about making that easy wanted a fun project more than one product at the video place would love to use Bixby
 nnn this means
 easy to use means that that you know everybody uses is when we started what's up with Ruby on Rails was really clear that you needed you know at least a restful API and that you can do whatever you want basically you can adopt that will do to your butt buddies requires work suck some effort and then we have the ruby-on-rails integration was really great ruby-on-rails ruby-on-rails integration white ones are there this is web development platform integration with that Reuben Trails Phoenix AZ language on sale for used carrier wave packages that I used to manage what type of replacement for that and when we have that's running and it's really great but that's ruby-on-rails what about you see you said it so there's no GSN there is BHP in in in in there is where was Django in Python
 there was. Nathan and each and every one of them one job is a job or was Carla and on top of that he's playing for supper what do you support and we obviously want to support everything so approach we took so far what would you try to support everything gets help from the community so are our actual sdks are all open source are there available to download a lot of time in and making sure that are AP eyes are updated together with RSD case it is a struggle are supposed to get a lot of help from the community so so you Fremont New infrastruktur meet you or something you have a solution for that some of that is you know you don't think the community some of that sweet we just bring in we we we will make it into the official packaging them filled out from there so we spend a lot of time on that a lot
 cloudinary grew in the early days what were the first skill ability bottlenecks do you started to hit
 okay again bootstrap concept so you want to hear these bottlenecks right now so that tells you where you should focus your efforts on right so it and then we rarely knew in advance so it's a good thing that the actual areas it will we're going to hit send then then the first thing that we really need to soak so it's a good thing and we love that obviously had a lot to do with the image manipulation front right then and getting to it I think it's still by the way still a work in progress progress it will always will be right this is this is our thought process behind that but getting the cyst service due to the situation which you have a complete auto scaling solution that is fast adequate that that support. That's maybe a little more than outside as well as but I guess are big
 struggle but at that was a big part of that in parallel you have the database in database infrastructure and how do you skill database how do you go from there is it there no sequel that it obviously wasn't in trouble silly as an end once again as you grow new features are made a parent so better search capabilities around just cuz one of the things that we offer our customers is either way we're also their image database Aiken store meditate and then querida images on top of that they can do that directly from their front end right so that that's that's eating also receiver more how do you spell in are things that were very treatable to us that will happen actually didn't so to this day for example we are still using Charlotte my sequel clusters with one when when we were sure that at this time
 it would have been turned into a complete you know no simple solution so we have no sequel databases but not for the main data and stuff so so you know what you you
 we learn as we go. Why didn't you end up having to having to switch the switch from from sharted my sequel to to some kind of nosql solution to reasons for Civil Works Bicycle Works and what is a note seriously so it's only think about my sequel we know the limits of the service so the solution we know where we are going to hit the limits and and now you have two options right you can you can go to a shorted solution which of these works really well because we have a lot of customers different customers like you have thousands of customers so it's easy as they are that that that require no sequel approach elastic service
 either we we we we need to be on The Cutting Edge right so we are holding yourself back in a way saying hey but but this is so cool we can do this and that but then saying yes but he's down at the critical feature right now is that a crystal requirements it is it's a good question about specifically about what we had we had some some some some less than optimal experience working with that Sandra was our are chosen solution at the time just
 the way we did things the specific requirements with that we have from the with with Cassandra
 tried it just wasn't working for us unfortunately more color on that like more and more detail why Cassandra wasn't good for you
 we'll meet up for that but that's this is exactly okay well sending this probably at the at the cross section of technicality and and business cases in 2013 you switched from using Amazon cloudfront to Akamai for your CDN why did you do this was back then but then I'm getting caught from the opticor with with the the other namus off of Del City and solutions has been there for for the last 15 years or so and he said that back then we talking to two and a half years ago some like that 3 years ago
 we had issues with Cloud photos of issues first of all it wasn't comfortable enough for us so for example Edge base decision-making solutions that we needed really needed what we currently do with cloud from Super example of a give you one example so well and you can tell us basically this is my image the same as don't want to show me too I don't know 300 by 300 do face detection add this photo mark But then again you decide what format the image needs to be at why do you do that because it's almost a piece of silk Romper also supposed to wear b and end at the superior let's go look for a sexy. Solution Superior format to jpg if you are an Internet Explorer jewelry users view this CD image of an interest or you want to deliver a cheetah cakes are which is again babe but let's hold equivalent of wet be on the Internet Explorer 2012 sport
 either of these formats in which will be a JPEG how do you take the guesswork from the developers work we will the way we do that basically is we tell you that use a single URL single URL a plug-in with all those formats Auto a photo and cloner will make the decision for you so it's single URL you know if we do you need to vary the other than the actual web browser so I can't was a huge problem couple of years ago when I started adding adding accepted as that we can very accordingly according to the you don't got that sell some specific identify that this is a Chrome browser need support sweat bee and we can deliver it be based on that not a different format so that we do not mix in accidentally offer and Firefox browser it would be a photo wasn't an option so it was okay so that's
 what's now what we have this amazing offer our customers. Call from the support that so that was one of the reasons the other reason and I think it's still there which is completely weird two reasons first of all Alchemist brand name right so so just let you use cloudinary so one of the things I should say this allowed to use cloud on our free free tier you can just sign up for that love that. Just just use the service she was small it's free you see how come you said you're talking like right now, I probably would have been there to talk to you if you weren't I don't know 10 Farrell Ice in bed with and then thousands of dollars a month now you could get a, which is huge right you know what I can do about this is really cool and Amsterdam
 the weird thing is I come out which is which is a relatively inexpensive solution was beginning to be more affordable than Cloud front of the time because the way Cloud front is actually calculating in and many other or calculating your cost because it's based on usage so well how come I just you know it's about the band with at the end of the month call Franz principal is geographically based right so great but if you look at how the guys are playing at the South America or Australia of the base price at you you actually think you were seeing something that we realized again really late on in and I'm not sure that the people actually are aware of their butt butt images are you know your average image way
 is usually around if you were doing your job right is for you to be around 15 kilobytes in size fuse again web be in soft use cloud will be less than 10 kilobytes on that level if you just punch in the numbers because because one of the things that fall out front. The way they price or Services based on requests in addition to bed with rice you have requests any varies based on geography and varies based on whether use SSL fabrication PS traffic or not and some other stuff you have call Sprint elevations in case you would need to only the cost per request which looks Tiny Tots like zero in lots of zeros are after that but if you actually punched at the end like you have saved my butt smaller images
 and I don't suppose increases Ellis athlete Dominator car so we're paying more on our request then on our bed with and when you have a solution such as I can which is it looks it looks costlier but again what do punch old that these little things into the equation you just happened it was actually cheaper solution for us at the time you are an interesting spot because you can kind of you take the fixed cost structure of Akamai and because you've already got a bunch of paying customers you can serve it you can serve non-paying customers with Akamai level service at a freemium deal we simplify seeing things for us right where we we thought initially hey let's split that difference difference in LCD but then again it's much simpler easier and everybody wins so so it seems like a good
 okay it's just really interesting change so another scalability change that you made in 2013 was to use Amazon sqs why is SQ well that would tell me what is sqs and why is it useful soaking service every possible three letter acronym that this Amazon Price Rite of Spring this experience using Amazon services that time already there man is the sequel like a database online but but decided to to skip on that we are huge users of Amazon S3 right we use that everybody uses asked me today I guess it was all resources in Captain's House and stuff like that obviously in tons of other Solutions try along the way we use SAS 4 for email sending
 and much more than that by the Amazon offers really amazing Lego pieces you can just punch him together as for sqs itself good question I live that's all I will say that this is not her or main so you know this is a big one for jobs right when you think of a job and cooling system is basically to do with with the actual who does the actual image manipulation because this is where you are but not for the main squeeze of jobs people who actually does the manipulations and seltzer
 there are hundreds of tools for looking at user data Google analytics optimizely mixpanel customer. I owe all of these tools can be useful for figuring out how users are engaged with a product unfortunately many of these tools require you to write domain specific code in order to gather the data and set up your Integrations what if I told you that there is a product for reading code only wants a single API a tool for unifying your data and Performing analytics on any platform for Marketo to MailChimp segment is that product segment simplifies your analytics so that you can collect customer data with one API and send it to any of hundreds of tools for analytics marketing and data warehousing with segment a developer can satisfy all the stakeholders at once from the data driven account manager to the app happy marketer to the data sign
 who needs a data warehouse with a clean schema thanks to segment your CEO will fall in love with your newly efficient Integrations with tools like zendesk intercom and appnexus I'm falling in love with segment just talking about it thanks to segment for sponsoring software engineering daily if you are listening to software engineering daily and you have not tried segment give it a shot at segment.com and tweet at segment to let them know you heard about the product on software engineering daily we wouldn't be doing this show without the sponsors so thanks again to segment for sponsoring this show now let's get on with this episode diagnosed the architecture a little bit in the business case let's talk a little bit about the day-to-day the operations tell me about the monitoring that you haven't placed you understand the sea
 some health and the types of teams that you have and how you organize those operational teams
 okay so I think maybe the number one
 priority for us he is is is operational basically we we we strive for a hundred percent out back for the service so I was saying images of really your core business right you just one day at work but this is exactly if you just wanted to work what he stops working this week this will be the first thing that you noticed right if someone something doesn't work on your website they are if they images of stop uploading to clock in and ask Laura behind the scenes this is where you will you'll feel it will be extremely painful right so this is our and always been our number one priority over there and it's not only about the DVD availability it's also about about upgrading the service right we work process in which you are adding additional pictures into the service and they are always happening with chlorine you features that are rated all the time we're up at 9
 put it on then how do you do that and still keep that same you know I'm amazing. But I'm going on around there again and we were very tough using existing amazing you speak them in logstash to tumultuous things Cabana in more and more Integrations between Arabi at than other and in our own stuff we use twilio we actually had a ear is an interesting system twilio actually obvious will have to call us in the middle of the night anytime more sorority is is is is higher than x in case we don't have anyone old coal specifically their swords of elephant things after me we can buy these things to help one for the system and try to understand what's what's up and what's going on
 and also for we had a pretty great traction I think this is a good opportunity to to roll back to the conversation about bootstrapping cuz I feel like the idea of bootstrapping a CDN is not something that would be possible in a pre AWS World maybe you can tell me whether or not that's true and to what extent you were able to architect the system to be able to essentially run at low cost and then be able to scale the system as your your customers scaled
 supercilious said sorry to you I wasn't accurate so right so so what are the most expensive thing growing on his is getting a product to Market building a product that is so I can report it is valuable enough to give some value to a customer's at either respect the devil you know open the wall of sand in mp happy to pay something for it to actual value to a customer but to do that you need to build a product natural product bring it out to Market bringing the frogs out tomorrow cuz usually very expensive so and n n n Eddy takes time so there is another thing here that we were extremely lucky with but getting was called a product Market fit right so you have a product out there you know you will be able to find that in the area that will make you both make you happy working on that
 Weather Service in both will make your customers happy so we can take some time that's just an excuse to bring something in the end the conversation started you talk to the customers and then they will tell you why it's an awful idea and what we need to do something else but you can do that something else right wheel by and whoop a lot of money to do that so easily for companies you need to build a product and then you need to have some spare cash so you can you can talk to customers be out there showcase will product get people to stop using that start making money or do the actual switched if you have to do with why I think the other the numbers are allowed that 70% of the companies are actually on the people think either first year we've been on Market RP 15 on technology so
 it takes a lot of time time thanks a lot of money and you need the right people aboard to do that to me to build a product its marketing it's dead right so so it's costly so nnnnn really easy play before that you know will how costly will be so the first thing you do once you have this I didn't even even and even before that if you are at least you know how to erase some fun before that you know the first thing that you do is probably get some fun so the first thing that most companies do you sell to the BC right you need to get the visa number no selling to a customer service of the BC get money can you be able to to to establish the other the vision that you have your hat
 now let's talk about Connor for a second what happened there because we were amazingly lucky on so many fronts so rudely base that's Founders time right there that's our own sign that is on the line like we are not getting paid we're doing something else so for us several things happen for Civil War 3 technical Founders to the most amazing software developers I had an encounter and keep in mind at what we've been doing in the past few years before that was helping entrepreneurs Builders Opera Solutions so we knew how to build a tan when you have to go that's relatively fast accurate um low-cost so it's only our time we need to get an external consultant c22 consulting job to help us with development in we do need to bring in rugby expensive ruling on developers or you know whether the solutions for that as well right but the whole lot compensation question about some options versus a vs Cell
 but but we need to do that so we have a product rule young and then we're lucky enough to be working on a personal pain points that we could validates ourselves to our first customers for Sprint customers were customers of our consultancy shop that we were we could talk to them and tell them hate we build that we know that this is what you think about this will save you time so we can get your amazing solution is ridiculous it would have cost you ten times more than someone else so we we have the market validation we we we we build a product very even wave area for the play because we did that in house ourselves and we knew what we were talking and we already got so so we got a bill Edition.... The initial plans in place and where the position that we could have taken some time off for our day today you got that is another big thing
 work or time that that's that's money right so it is money it's not you know what would you say bootstrap it does say that you didn't take that extra money but but Founders time is is my would have been working on this thing so we were in it we have lots of different things working for us in that respect and got us two positions that were able to get some initial funds rolling in from our customers and we were able to hire our first couple of employees just so still not taking money for a cell but week we got to sleep aid Harbison full-time jobs in in Brooklyn just in and getting paid by by by our customers themselves which is very powerful stop and continue from there
 Eddie said that won Wimbledon point with were always asking the same question is now Define to raise funds this is this is a common conversation with us every couple of months let's stop let's look at our budget for let's look at our plans he's not the right time to raise funds are we are we missing an opportunity by not hiring I know some people faster because being bootstrapped Big Sean a certain curve cuz you raised 4 million I think recently know so actually we haven't we have an investment for bbp but that's a secondary investment as opposed to Prime an investment that's basically small liquidation event let's go to that and it was was fine and so are in it. That's a whole different discussion why that's an interesting thing to do in your downside risk not really cuz we didn't do that for the money what we did do cuz for us again we have
 an egg in this crazy bootstrap thought process is OKC
 crazy relative to the crazy addiction to debt that startups have in our in our current ecosystem like this is going to seem so perverse to me is this obsession with with raising money and you know obviously there are times where you want to raise money and it certainly makes sense in many contacts but we're basically having a conversation about how you can bootstrap a CDN and if you can bootstrapcdn what can't you bootstrap and I think that's a conversation that people aren't having enough I think some people do have that conversation but it is one worth having side I just want to disavow value of the idea that I I think it is in anyway crazy to bootstrap but to the same effect I am extremely curious about why you would want to liquidate for million dollars worth of the company if it wasn't to protect downside risk
 so yes let's answer that's what one of the things that when you look at a VC company money is one thing that you get from them. That's probably if you know that the play music while want to grow and stuff like that but you also get a lot of other things right you have a financial back behind you if you need it up when you get an Advisory Board which is which is amazing people that are out there you get amazing connections and who had skin in the game
 yes definitely know we always wanted that but how do we do that without paying the tax
 so we don't want to relinquish control of the company not not not not in the slightest we didn't want to they look taller or employees right there this is this is a very we should have been for everybody we didn't want anything to change so what did everything but didn't want to pay for that in a few months ago we got the opportunity to do that because Gloria was doing again we're going very fast we have money in the bank we are lots of customers everything working in the heat was extremely rare right bbp name that one of their Judy candescent they never did such a mess before and it was only because and and we were in. That would be expecting basically this is because we're okay we're doing okay which seems really silly out there but the first time that I'm mats in this case Adam Adam Adam is RR
 bvp partner that is responsible for European Israel colonies originally silly as an Israeli company office in Palo Alto from where I'm talking to right now what company is Adam we have an amazingly on board so we had this person with the end up inside to say hey you know what I'm with you I just want to be on board and in a few years when you want to raise some funds to talk to his first which was basically. That the deal that we currently have with that
 nice but doesn't change a little and ended by the way the reason entire conversation about what you should do why you should do that as well write it it helps distress remove stress from the founder of which is amazing just as know that that he felt an all-or-nothing thing right now there's anything feces understand that that you never eat around nothing boost your company any company part of that is just get that for the founders get that for the team just just distress think long-term right it's all good it's something All or Nothing things when you do need to make a decision about liquidation it's all good so so it is important in other ways, but this was not about getting funds over the product product is again Harborside good or not but there's always say a little bit crazy but it works and it's amazingly well and most other companies
 as I was saying it's not about we have tremendous left early on with because of all the bowls all the guys are rolling out favor in that but usually it's not an option but usually that that's it that's a painstaking long process of building a product reaching a good thought of getting initial traction and then grown from there and by that time you already raised at least two rounds you related to be around that you were actually breaking even and then again you have the money in the bank what are you using that for and then you're dipping into you know Billy Joel CLC marketing team your you know not profitable and longer and then the process repeats itself so I feel it's cliche at this point but I would be remiss not to ask a nurse we're getting we hear this narrative over and over again lately that winter is coming and likes VC
 money is going to dry up and again and again it continues not to happen and my perspective on this thing is that there are so many fundamentally good businesses at this point that this whole winter is coming thing is is not it's not really it's not the way that is portrayed in the media so much less subtle than the reality and the reality is that for for the good businesses like it seems like it's all it's the funding environment is almost unchanged from from the old days to today is that is that an accurate so yes it is and what happens if you watching the market by the week so let's let's give some credit to be Pure Morning Tori the Cloudy index they had that to Heather.... Major Cloud companies out there the other day and in the end what you just saw the link Tenzin and you relaxing and stuff and just a couple
 that was a huge dick we're talking about 40% of the market value just you raising and almost a single day right for the waiting was a single day and what is but but if he gets meet maybe it is but we think it is. That's what if you look at the valuation valuations one that. That's what one things that are important to Founders right side of this is how much I make and hopefully this is how much I make and how much you're going you're not going to know nobody can predict the future but then again the multipliers just dropped by probably fruit 50% snow everybody right so the at the top of the list yet but I guess you know August of last year some like that it's that we're now at 50%
 nations in in in money is much harder to get by to get right now so it is
 looking for talking a month ago that that that that they would have been a hundred percent true right now something that things are are are slowly stopping still there is a lot of money on the table lot of money is available out of my Pieces Just dilutions Rock processor on my charger right now so there is a change to portray was that there is a higher floor on how bad it can get then people recognize do you think that's true
 like in in terms of how bad it can get it's not going to get to 1999 bad right because it's because of the fundamentals of the businesses are too strong for that to happen and that's what people are constantly be moaning. They're so afraid of is a good question so whether there is that the last you at least last episode of got funded was easier to do it's going to be harder this year so something is going to happen but later this year because because again money only lasts for a year or a year and a half maybe 2 years that that's a lot in this audible right now what did you ask for a year and we're talking about so you know mid last year was amazing and this year calculations was dropped by 50% right bounce back out nobody can really predict what's happening but then again what will happen in a few months at and where anybody could go but but something is
 is is about to happen and that's what aspects I got to eat was always a question in an app that goes back to the booster part of the things that you can raise money raised as much as possible right now because winter is coming right nobody knows what will happen if you a few months from now few years when I get it right now put in the bank and you have it for a four up for a rainy day having said that where we're at right now so we have a growing companies actually profitable right so so where the position and that it again that's a high wheel polishing stuff like that were keeping us are profitable are the positions we can we can slow things down keep that very healthy company but is that the right thing to do was the right thing to do was raised just a huge bunch of money as as we we got some some cool opportunity to do it again rainy day and stuff was control and another location but but that doesn't the company is
 let nobody can know what the right thing is but what I'm trying to say I guess about the pieces this is this is this is this is how things are done right if you ask me what is should I boost the company that said that the answering in I think I think I don't know 9 times out of 10 would have been no social Billet product of the product you need to spend a lot of time with that so so get some valuation for you get some validation for yourself you know that this is what you want to do in the next 3 4 5 years of your life if minimum right but if you like that and if you like what you do you want that done and you're ready to enter the right thing to do any basketball nation that that the reason Market out there for the 4 for your solution then you don't nine times out of nine times out of ten
 go get some funny money because you won't be able to do that any other way you'll be with your back to the wall in a year from now because of everything and stuff zero money in the bank and you going to make some bad decisions better yet to receive money right now so we were good juice case we managed by so far but
 yeah let me know what it Where do you like about the philosophy of just like raise when you can it's just it it has the underlying philosophy of like the goal is to continue playing the game you just don't want to get frozen out under any circumstances exactly in for us this is exactly I can play but but keep in mind that that for most companies it's not an option for most companies it's not okay we can stop right now or we can let's do it differently you are always losing money and this is what usually happens software-as-a-service solution every but everyone out there is
 but the vast majority of the vast majority is losing money on monthly basis you do not have the option to do anything else but plan for the next month and ground so so is that a failure of the way people are structuring their businesses like is that and is that a cultural addiction to running a debt whenever baby that's it is a big question yes if you need to to to to build most people out there that do not have that do not need to use initial fans are other people out there
 companies Angel Investors species that that's know how to invest this really really risky money and it will love to be on board with you there was a cost to do that it's some of that is is is keeping them...... Control which makes a lot of money into your company that they want to know that our money is well spent so this is it is how it is so it's all good well that's a great way to close off super interesting conversation lot of lot of discussion about fundraising and business less about running an image CDN but funny funny vine CBS next conversation I'll have to have
 oh okay well thanks for coming out to soften during daily it's been super interesting talking to you and I'm really happy to have we had card marries a sponsor over the fluent weeks and I'm really glad that some really interesting product and I'll be following you guys closely thanks for coming on the show thank you so much and will be actually at school and so if anybody wants to come and say hi we will be sure I will come by and talk to you thank you so much

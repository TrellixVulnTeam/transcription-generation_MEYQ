Transcription: Apache Cassandra is a distributed database that can handle large amounts of data with no single point of failure since 2008 Cassandra has been widely adopted and the software and the community around Cassandra have grown steadily a software developer interacting with Cassandra uses cql because Sandra query language still a DB is another open source database that has been created to be totally compatible with cql by complying with cql the internals of Scylla DB can be a vastly different software rewrite from Cassandra Sila GB use a C plus plus where is Cassandra uses Java Sila GB improves upon the performance characteristics of Cassandra by optimizing for Modern Hardware and a dorla or joins the show today to discuss how sylheti beat does all of this for 2/3 I am looking for sponsors if you're interested in sponsoring software engineering daily or you want to advertise on the show please send me an email at software engineering daily at gmail.com and if you
Joy episode please share it on Facebook or Twitter the show grows by word of mouth and the listeners have been very gracious and sharing and I hope that continues also if you have any questions about the show any criticism or feedback you can always send me an email or you can just say hi you can also just wait at me I'm very open to talking to people who listen to show after a message from today's sponsor we will get to this episode Sila TV and Cassandra with dorla or
 I had a crazy idea couple weeks ago it's a photo sharing app that only has pictures of cats when I finish my photo sharing Cat application I will be deploying it to linode because Leonard is the fastest hosted Lennox provider I don't want to get locked into a proprietary platform it's going to overcharge me as soon as my LPS popular I just want a fast Linux server with simple pricing go to lenovo.com SE daily and get $20 in free credit today plans start at $10 a month so my free $20 will be plenty to watch my cat photo sharing app once I need to scale I can use tools like a node balancers and backups and Lynyrd has built-in dashboarding and metrics so that I can see the traffic to my linode servers and I can understand how many of my users are posting cat pictures and looking at each other's cat pictures
 go to lenovo.com SE daily and get $20 in free credit today that the plans start at $10 a month such a great deal thanks to linode for sponsoring a software engineering Daily Now what's going on to this episode
 Dora or is the CEO of Scylla DBA database that is compatible with Apache Cassandra you're welcome to software engineering daily hello and good afternoon or whenever you are thank you for inviting me
 absolutely so let's start by talking about Cassandra and then we will get into still at DP so I think it's confusing for some people so commission over before what Cassandra is and why people use it
 Soca Sandra is nosql database nosql stands for not just SQL you can ask Larry Ellison because he says recently that the work early so no sequel databases well because it's simple that you're so I bet he's right as I was specifically is one type of panel layout of data bases with him the no sequel that they can get sick mended into sub families as well you can find other document store databases like mongodb and couchbase which are kind of stimulus and used to wear their nose real document but so Jason objects which is really good to get started but later on but they can bike back because you haven't given a lot of thoughts for the or schema and that's why you'll gets probably
 place value bugging them later on discovered that the schema actually resides within your data and you can have difficulties that's what I did to that Cassandra is part of the family which is more of a table but more like them the regular SQL database but without transactions and without joints so you can think about just as a table with columns and rows specifically Cristiano Ronaldo still at because it's just compatible has a wide row structure of copper that soon but basically means that it within your cells in the table you can store them not just started feel like feels like in string or binary blob you can store their tiny table
 Sansa sub comes inside of them and you can manage schema and canceling the transactions and Joints is that you can scale out very very very well Cassandra can scale up to thousands hundreds of thousands of node in the singles cluster to best of my knowledge it's the best distributed them distributed database or the distributed infrastructure out there because of the rest of the gang Don scale. Match
 Endwell just to to to be sure it's it keeps all of the results consistent in disc so it does it's not an in-memory solution because data gets written to the disc and that leads me to another subset of the no sequel family which is the memory type of key value stores like men casual reddish which which allows you to keep data in the cash and respond pretty fast but normally they're there either schema-less just provide key values sometime they provide more sophisticated verbs and normally they don't they are semi persistent so data isn't synchronized immediately to the disk and there's quite the biggest the lag and also there is a limitation that you can store more data in the disc then your Ram size so everything
 has its advantages and disadvantages does not have transactions and will people here that makes you can't write to it or you can't delete from it would describe what that means like when you say Cassandra doesn't have transactions what do you mean by that so I actually have a some type of transactions that are recently new know. I think it's around 2 years old but they they are called LifeWay transactions but if we are most of the users don't tend to use them so let's talk about the loan transaction type of exercises which is the most common once it means that you access the database and you store the information there but they didn't on the transaction way so it sometimes it's
 quit drinking and I am I X X actually spend that today for a customer so when data reaches the database Cassandra has a configurable replication factors normally wouldn't just stored at 8 in the single node but you were going to replicated into other nodes and normally people just choose the Quorum soap once the data which is the Chrome wolf substitute for your class rather than the client gets an acknowledged back and describe what happens however this isn't quite a transaction because let's say you started the Rite process and the coordinator for this operation which is the note that the client access first client connection
 yes to picking another but then you know it can be a coordinator so when the coordinator start sending the rights to all of the replicas and stir in weights for a majority limit safe it's a chrome let's say there is a sailor and the entire network failed for some reason and just a single server accepted and actually managed to write the did Ada and all of the other servers failed so of course the client
 a by either the coordinator manager to send a negative response to the client or did the time didn't hear in timed out so the client assumes that's the day I didn't reach the cluster and it's okay but actually the day. Be rich one nodes and when the classes will get reconnected the date I will get propagated to the other nodes in the classroom because it wasn't a transaction are you can think about the transaction transaction fees do phase commit so there wasn't any two phase commit here and that's why they do that which is a single know it's concealed be there in the database so that's saying something that's users should think about
 I try to think the distinction of your drawing is when we talk about transactions in traditional date of as you can tell me this is correct or incorrect we think about transactions in traditional databases we think about these Atomic like you said toothpaste made a three phase commit or whatever where you have a strong consistency guarantees and with Cassandra it's more of this app and Only log of things that are happening across the data and nodes just catch up as they get the chance to and the the the delete process you know that the add the delete process uses tombstones and that's the eventual consistency version of a delete but the main point is that you have this eventual consistent transaction log of things that eventually propagate to all the notes in that is in contrast to the strongly consistent two or three phase commit type of distributed database would you say it's accurate
 Squad records okay so if we ease into the conversation of Scylla DB we should talk a little bit about the query language that Cassandra uses uses a query language called cql why does Cassandra need a unique query language why can't it use an SQL variant or query language like Mongo
 I'm so sick year old tries to mimic the more sophisticated feature-rich SQL verb so it's kind of similar and D4 familiar with SQL you feel like home relatively fast however it lacks features like Jo-Ann's and some of the aggregations on there and that's kind of a limitation again those features were dropped from the database delivered in order to allow better High availability scaling out so there wasn't intentional software given to these things I think that's as we go along then there is a convergence into database world so the cql language evolves and you can see things like a secondary indexes and materialize used you can store
 Jason or Bassin extract Jason objects it the where Clause evolve ncqa also I think there's a fairly good chance that City weather in SQL won't be that different if we'll look at the medium-term future and if we compare what is Sandra had in the past it was almost to schema West and when the thrift protocol was used and there wasn't no good language like seek you out so we eventually it's a good Midway a compromise and going forwards I think that's what eventually will see ask you out almost a full SQL form and I mentioned before that's a nice way to transactions existing Cassandra so many times you may
 Knott's need transactions for data that is about recommendation engines is social information data coyote data but you would want transactions for daylight, user ID password etcetera so good that's why I like my transactions were added nice thing is to see to observe databases like phosphorus where they try to add more for Jason verb so the debts why I claim that converges is starting and did all of the database will move the winning languages and the winning verbs with will eventually be more calm anymore databases
 what are the shortcomings of Cassandra
 I'm so that there's a couple so first no joints and no acid so but I think its users are used to it it's ended that's why there is no sequel databases Beyond and just normal last year else but beyond that there's a couple of things first good customer uses log structured Mercury it means that up and only mention that deletes translate to actually writing data which is the tombstone butts being the background there was no magic and it makes rides very very fast however it's it's it's comes on the expense where there is it should be a background process called compaction that needs to be in the background the database needs to marriage all of the copies that were written to a single key just do to keep the latest and
 is form and collapse all of those tombstones so the disc will want get filled as a ricer a relatively fast on the expense of weights and also on some expensive Administration burden because a database a person or that person needs to manage into in the database so that's one thing fast rides on the expensive rates and some admin. Second of all it's uses job job is to take language for management but notes for Ice video as given to the developers a relatively fast start but the S8 evolve them it's just a pain and Cassandra developers try to constantly move objects from the hip to
 if it's over off hip and that supports defeats the purpose because why do you drive on the first hand you do that too little it the framework kind of the memory management so they don't get to enjoy from the features that you have a provides and they do suffer and in Java users suffer from very complex tunables they suffered Juju garbage collection which eventually reach a phase it's called stop the world and the entire all of the threads need to stop and make sure that the garbage collection with Ron and clean the memory and is the is the amount of ram consoling Chris and not to mention new memory model like a non-volatile ram approaching
 then the problem will continue to grow and grow and so that's quite painful for a for the user so I watch it and eventually translates to large latencies unpredictable agencies and also the performance level that the single notes can provide on that's good cuz I know uses off-the-shelf Java and uses good generic mechanisms that comes from Lenox like the page cash which is terrific for cashing accesses but since its generic and not to tailored then it's not ideal for performance and
 right so so you've touched on all these shortcomings and many of them are eventually leading to some severe latency that you have improved upon in sylheti be in Sila TV is a no sequel column store database that is compatible with the cql query language so this is essentially a database that is Cassandra compatible you can drop out your Cassandra database and replace it with Cilla TV that's at least the claim so explain why you started building sylheti be so good the I'll try to shorten the long story in the past we built a unikernel called me when she's still a project that we support a or try to support him in best effort but it's not relevant to see her today and we we
 what did you run a variety of throw clothes 108 was optimized for Java mainly not just but for Java and and it was one of the sexiest workload we wanted to support and while our choice V operating system and and we had their own Colonel I had to really fast in slim Colonel with the r on TCP IP stack we want we saw that we we managed to boost the reddest performance by 80% and when we executed Cassandra Zen did the performance gains were almost lost what would they were sometimes games of 20% more but sometimes it went away and we will Reserve that enough resources are given to Cassandra Cassandra can't utilize all of them
 so we understood that there's a larger opportunity for improvement we know that some companies that's from a thousand plus a thousand machines at the time Google Engineers published The Benchmark refusing 300 Cassandra virtual machines in order to reach 1 million operations per second and coming from a system programming background most of us came from the KVM Project Baby hypervisor then we we knew what a motor machines are capable for off and ridiculous like a single machine can can do this type of performance and we prove that that's what we thought before and that's what we proved today with Sarah because we have Benchmark the show that you can get to 1.8 million C to F
 request for second and that's quite dramatic Improvement
 social is approach to know SQL design obviously you mention the fact that it takes it takes advantage of the fact that Cassandra it or Cassandra like database takes on rivers of the CPU hundred percent of the memory but the zilla's approach is also optimized for Modern Hardware what are the trends in Hardware that has shaped your strategy with Cilla
 so if it's goes it's because the following but there are multiple things so the first one is multi-core CPUs speeds stop increasing frequency and then let's not argue about whether more love alive or not but frequency stop rising and it says what we have more cores and it's very challenging to a to utilize all of those cords what when I was managing the project the performance team didn't couldn't find a benchmark that utilize more than 40 to 80 chords because the Benchmark itself wasn't scalable so it's it's quite the challenge for software the designs that we took with Sheila is is the design that uses short pier corn ocean
 it means set apart from the fact that we do Sheridan like many other distributed systems it. Old do shouting in the castle level and we do the exact starting that uses within like nodes we use additional level of shorting which is transferring from the user it charred has a core of it self storage people called threads per core and it's the exact thing but extended so are shards has a single court or more accurately hyperthreads they have their own memory so we divide the memory bear Shard a logically and in the memories always knew Moloko because I access the local memory that resides on your socket is way more twice as fast than accessing remote more memory on and some other socket and
 local IO devices like Matic unique or sometime in the future coming up multi queue storage devices then we would access devices directly by the core and yeah I dear is to to be lock less because it's such such an internal chard Owens its data so there's no need to lock the data know there's no talking whatsoever boxing x86 are pretty expensive first when they're contendant and the D'Amore course you have them the more contention than that you have so there is a likelihood that somatic or I will own that lock and the other cords will just go idle and neither is there is no contention and their looks are a heads find granularity just obtaining the lock you need to lock the bus and it's very expensive so one mechanism is the Manticore and took
 the answer Freddy's sharper Court that's one
 show you have mentioned these Hardware characteristics that you're able to take advantage of all of by we are protecting some of the things that Cassandra does in Sila could Cassandra just be real architected to take advantage of these characteristics or is there something that is holding Cassandra back from from doing from taking advantage of the same Hardware trends that you mentioned so did the answer is yes and yes so the developer observed naturally they observe observe the design we are open source in most of these open but it was so many of our internal discussions are opening our presentations and probably the stock as well so they they they try to
 we all see text Cassandra and have this move away from set up and have the similar threads per core approach without regular polling we know that there's some active work about that however that they don't have a chance to reach the performance level that we had bit because when you using the sickest fast like we do instead of java then we have direct access to all of the Machinery that and direct system call Access and full control of the machine when we compile the clothes we check in verified that the code is sufficient and we don't do just there no wasted virtual function calls etcetera Etc so I believe that's Dell improving time but not to the level of performance that we got
 so I think also one kind of edge you have is it still as starter from scratch in C plus plus so obviously there are things that you can do it C plus plus you can not doing Java but you can touch on the the difference between these two so I guess first like why was Cassandra written in Java was it just that it's like you could just talk about why Cassandra new job and then why what does C plus plus provide for these purposes that Java cannot
 I'm so without opening a religious War religion or then always super slices is a low-level language was well Javas high level 1 level programmers will always have the benefit that they may need to make may take awhile to long time to develop but the outcome supposed to be better why they chose the job how many big big dater project starts with a job out there a good things that happen in Java where it's relatively easy to share code and share packages like three of them and patient and you can just put actually loads at Cassandra jar to some other project to and right now you merge the two so that they are a
 benefits coming from the Java World in C plus plus there are libraries like boost which provides you grades basic building box but not to the level of Elsa and proseccos like thrifts etcetera but I would choose us over and over again and again it's it's
 no just a personal choice but it's the more rational Choice when your goal is to maximize the machine resources we just started to to speak about recent strands in the computers so it's just one of them and again Java has a problem with it because there's always the state of garbage collection and soak the world then it's increase your amount of memory where the Java Heap is relatively small the standard collector I had like a recommended heat off something between 8 to 16 gigabytes and that's it later on with G1 then I think G1 came to 64 or 128 GB
 okay. But that still isn't that much recently Amazon released 2 terabyte machine and I guess it's would just grow with the non-volatile technology is so that it's not just the multicore it's the memory as well and accessing devices directly we just started with the performance world so we didn't call her dad's but we support two types of Ohio's tax we support the Linux TCP IP stack that the sun doth one and we have any implementation of user space TCP IP with the same reactive model implemented in C plus plus I said we have which provides twice the performance when we we implemented Aprilaire prodigal like man catch day so we in the future we're going to
 it's already work works with Sheila but it's not Harden yet and we're both in the future will see another level of performance game a similar things are with the file system Wheels handful of Technologies are on the caches we bypass the Phoenix page cash and we plan of having our own fastest and so would we want you to stand out of the Shelf I system and go directly to the block live Isis

 when were talking about Saudi Arabia what are you in these abstract terms let's make this a little more tangible could you walk through a reed and a right Wasilla DB and explain how each of these respectively compares to a reed in a write-in Cassandra
 alright I'll do that I think that might have Bella / is a way better than me so it's only about six and a reason right path but I'll try to explain to the clients has a read request and it's pixel coordinator which is just one of the class or notes sometimes coordinator get picked by their proximity so did the the nearest know it will get picked it it's against similar rain in the between the two databases are identical in in that respect and the same client is used both but by both later basis so that the coordinator Parsons the secret request
 the size that exceeds a trade request and what we do is wish you a read that goes to the lack of disc and in parallel I think honestly would we issue agreed to in number to the number of which is the table is configured to order this specific operation because you can have your special operation may have its own configurable cymatics consistency so I for Simplicity so good Closter needs to collect a Chromebook to request a friend request from the majority of the service in the cluster the idea behind it is that since the
 since it's our eventual consistency database then I would like you'd like to consolidate data. Maybe more recent
 so did the coordinator coordinator starts collecting all of those weights asynchronously and when you get a large enough majority or large enough number then the answer propagates back to the crime identical with the two databases sometimes it's and it's goes even pay for more interesting cases if there is if betta isn't the same when I return from all of those Chrome for you know it's and there is a difference between the version of the data then the entire data set will get did the entire set of replicas that own this token range will get Garrett and consolidation with happening in the background and
 when did the Chrome will reach Consolidated a chrome of the servers than the day that will propagate back to the client pretty complex but identical in the two database know what's what we do is win for the Reeds we issue reads with o direct it means that we bypass the page cash and we manage our own cash it's a really important Advantage because if they are using the cash then will immediately respond back if there is nothing the cash then we were going to issue a synchronous dma operation for that this guy this guy says it will just read the exact object that we were asked for so if this object is it's a 512 bites in in debts I take this number because it's
 and it is sector of the disc smaller desks then we'll just read it this exact sector and that would be it now since we will we have the notion of threads per core within each of those threads we have our own scheduler so once we issued this I synchronize the email immediately slow relatively to the CPU so will immediately this schedule this context and we'll go to run some other contacts with us we don't have threads so these contacts are basically longer functions and are pores can are capable of running millions of Lambda functions we can do 1 million operation for off these Lot number functions so it's very very fast
 and when the disc returns then we are released the answer back to the client in the San Roque since it's kind of similar not just you can send her but before Thunder to a multi-threaded applications that uses the Linux page cache what happens is that a thread from from the listening pool get schedule to process the request and started shooting all of the request hopefully I synchronously sometimes not all of the network request for the replicas to to retrieve the the Reeds may not be fully asynchronous or may that they may still consume a thread so it sometimes if you have a lot of request going on then you you make an exhaust your thread pool
 in addition let's say the data is not in the in the cash the application Cassandra I mean the database application in our case doesn't have the knowledge that they nice not into Cash because the one who manages the cash is the colonel so it's just axis's just access the data but the colonel issues their page fault and thankful it's pretty expensive operation the thread get this scheduled to its heavyweight in terms of a CPU and also in terms of latency and if you have limit the number of threads Pullman this context of the threads will get blocked until they that will get back so you couldn't do 1 million operation / core of this exercises you can do thousand left them and that's pretty significant difference between the two
 Dutch earthquake comparison I think that covers a lot of the ground of how the two databases differ what about the scalability model how does Sheila DB scalability model differ from kassandra's
 it's up an easy question it's not you can turn offs getting out it it's the same thing so we have the gossip protocol with we have added the market data center a protocol we have snitches it's exactly the same and you can scale two hundred and thousand oaks now it's usually with our performance then there's no need to reach 1000 notes but you certainly capable of doing it
 okay so then a question that has less similarity with the two databases what about memory management sylheti be has no pauses under compaction or Garbage Collection in Cassandra how often does the cluster undergo compaction or garbage collection and how does this inhibit performance soap the two databases and it's not just said many database adults have active military and or just need to update new nodes steps joins the cluster have background operation it is opposed to the foreground of operation which are the regular and bio processing and semi transactions so what would they desire is that the fairgrounds operation will have
 today which one gets hurt by the background of operation because if if you're in the process of swimming data to a new nodes ordering compaction then most times that you can wait a little bit longer and you'll prefer that the foreground operation won't get no thank you weren't towards latency neither that's quite thankful Ariane Cassandra for instance eating all of those operations like compassion's repair and streaming Cassandra has static configuration for them and you can limit those operation operations like instrument you can limit seeds for for 25 megabytes a second in this way let's say that you have enough bandwidth more than that so you were guaranteed that is sort of a it's a week
 92 Toyota 4Runner processing won't want to go to hurt but it it comes in the expense that streaming will take a very long time and if you have let's a terabyte of data in your nose then eat weeds hours and days would go by until you manage to a stream it up a t talk to a new node and that's really the problem especially if you'd like to decommission in North Node in favor of the new note the same happens with compassion you you may not come back fast enough so if you could if you can if you put the thresholds too low then you'll fall behind with the background operations and you'll suffer it if you fall behind compactions then you'll have multiple stable files in order to Reed's you want to just wait a single file will you read a lot of fast sometimes.
 for single Reed operation the end that's horrible for performance instead we dynamically set this balancing and control this balance before we even a before we is in boots or arcilla Damon we ran a simple automatic strip that so basically it's a benchmark and the proposal this Benchmark is to calculate the sweet spots off maximum this concurrency if you increase the weather today in the best salsa related to your questions about Modern Hardware if you take acid STEEZ it's not just one rated widgets for Mattituck skopos doesn't send maybe a lot a lot more or smaller discs discs or units combined together and that's why you can access the this concurrently
 but there is a limit to the number of concurrent request of worst there there's a point where you add concurrency and you get better through foods and still keep your lower latency and Beyond the certain point let's say we be on 100 from current operations for in modern fastest then request would have just cute up by the disk controller are they may also be cured by the fire system code is well
 our Benchmark sweet sweet spot and we have an IO scheduler with insides in use of space inside silver which is totally transparent from the user now this sucks I'll schedule her role is to make sure that if we do not reach the point of Maximum this concurrency then it's goes in Full Speed Ahead and just a forwards all of the request directly to the fastest and then later on to the list so it means that if you ever come back then when you can come back to him a 1 gigabit-per-second if you have news enough have for groundwork workloads high workloads however you have probably won't close from coming from the background and forth from
 4 rounds then Araya scheduler do not feel the disc beyond the point of Maximum current currency and it has its own properties Haitian mechanic and we prioritize we have different classes for weeds for rides for compaction for repair and for streaming and dynamically we set the priority between them so as long as it's not that much to compact then will prioritize rice and reads and latency 111 get her to bed in and that's that that's how the system works and the benefit is is not only to have very good performance over the time for your background info for your for ground operations then there's no hassle because chewning Cassandra system for that is pretty
 a nightmare and even if you manage to do that then it will be accurate just for the particular workloads that you turned it or the particular machine that you run if the characteristics of your workload or machine change then you need to tune it's all over again automatically
 okay so will you talk a lot about the technical internals of still a DVD and how it compares to Cassandra I want to talk a little bit about the the business model and the first dose of the pride in the company so he is not open source in contrast to Cassandra's and it's not sure what is open-source so today I'm so sorry I'm totally confused about that out of success mode last September birthday Cassandra Summit so what was the been open source and return you can go and to just Mark is Stark or cloned get the quote
 okay haha that's Dustin we find out I'm so so then you know what are the what's the the business model like for sylheti be the company
 here would you didn't innovate much strength is in the collagen to eat in business would like to do for a business send as many as other open source vendors we work that red out to be 4 and we're familiar with the industry and our business model is subscriptions so those would like to Consumer open source best we welcome them and we we actually encourage them today there are sometimes we participated in alive and back then like we presented we discovered that the folks running the ceiling Productions where we we we didn't know even that they were using it so that's that's the open-source wait we actually have more than a single open source project there is the C lot which is a n end-user data base
 what you consume in the results of the ancient behind Cielo which is called sister and has most of the sophistication that's why I described and that's another independent open source project that we created for Selah a but one can take our project and Internet and try to replace some other old-fashioned system with it
 so that's the open source in in terms of business then where a company is DC back company in and we definitely need needs to to be profitable so we do subscriptions yearly subscription send in those first subscriptions we provide support are we provide a long lifetime guarantee and to Enterprise version of our database that I think is interesting about the business and just about the project itself is the fact that you can kind of take advantage of some things from the Cassandra Community because you are cql compatible and it reminds me of a show that we did recently with citus data which is a postgresql extension that makes distribute postgres easier and one thing that the gas
 from situs I was gone he said was that when you use the postgres extension functionality you can extend postgres and you don't you don't want to cuz you don't want to for postgres you don't want to work because then you'll lose all the support of the open source community and it's what I heard when I Was preparing for this show was that despite being a complete rewrite of much of the Cassandra functionality cuz it's all in C plus plus and you do all these things differently you can take advantage of things like because Sandra spark connector which is pretty interesting cuz you actually in this case you actually are getting to leverage some of the developing things that are going on in the Cassandra community so I'm just curious to what extent that is the case where you can go you can Leverage The the ongoing development of the Cassandra Community which despite being a cup
 the different database so good the the difference between the two examples that you've given is the location off those tools hook a prosperous case then did the plug-in runs in the context of the database so you can utilize the underlying there there Boo and it said plug into that gives you additional functionality if I understand that correctly uses everything beneath and provides additional functionality on top of it will be implemented everything underneath but everything on top of the database of each of the databases Remains the Same because
 Battle Bowling in cql wire prodigal so all of the clients eyes remain the same and the only way to access the database is using a client so that's the way boss cast forget it I'm sorry. That's a waste spark accesses Cassandra Wasilla using cql dude that's the only connects are possible the same with odbc driver or a Presta project that has Cassandra bindings and kitten Works nicely over Selah it was some other time series data bases like KIRO TV and so forth so it is replaced
 okay so as we begin to wrap up I'd love to know what the cility B team is work on today and what is in the future for the project
 alright so today we actually this very day we are released 1.2 release so far as big as 1.2 released included items that were left a turkey space functionality are we added cql compression so you can compress the other client to server potco a bunch of other goodies I can say that we were really busy and we also reduce latency we we have a very interesting technology blog where we blog about our latency journey and I really recommend readers to go to that plug in general in particular worry about the latency games that we just released it they were not sweet
 it's too that's related to Cielo because she lies is the regular Linux process so if you go to the blog you can read about our journey about joining the schedule the Olympics schedule their properties tuning c groups within the next tuning
 we have a Java jmx proxy demon witch in in order to get compatibility so users will be able to work with Sheila the way they work with Cassandra using the Note 2 we added the edge of a process process just for admin comfortability and guess what's this tiny Java function a process a increase the latency so we had to handle it as well so we eventually the maximum latency we measured was 1.8 millisecond that's the maximum knots the 99 percentile but but the maximum light and see what we were released today and I thinking around the next two to three months I had will close some Gap this we have with Cassandra it's totally compatible but there were several small feature
 that we were relaxed Left Behind like a sometimes small but important like like secondary indexes and materialized views 1 compaction strategy got left behind so they tear duct infection will come next month and things of this sort

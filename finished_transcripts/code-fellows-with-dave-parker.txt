Dave Parker is the CEO of code fellows and in-person codes School offering web and mobile development training in Seattle Portland in Chicago Dave welcome to software engineering daily based software engineering daily about coding bootcamps and each boot camp seems to have its own unique flavor what makes code fellows unique thing is unique about code fellows is really it's history we've been around for two and a half years and we started is Annie Zac was the chairman still a tournament and was the founder and I was around the whole idea of development accelerator at the time and he was running techstars here in Seattle and one of the ongoing problems as you guys know is that you got some great companies that are not getting funded for textures and have a lack of lack of development Talent
so that program originally got started as developing accelerator that really help find more Dev talent for startups and it still today about 20% of our challenge goes to start up so early employees are founder and co-founder a quote from you that said the code fellows story is about people who want to make a career change when your goal is to serve students who are making a career shift how does that change the expectations and the structure of your coursework
the history there Jeff is our average student is in the 25 to 35 year old range we definitely have them it's Q younger and older both but most men that point where they realize they put your ladder in their career up against the wrong wall and I hit the ceiling way too early so the most of us that means we get out of college we taking a job in the first industry that the tenant gives us a decent offer in that maybe in Hospitality your food and beverage your paralegal or maybe a sysadmin in the tech side and we realize that we really want to get a better opportunity so we pretty much tapped out early and then go start looking around and talking to people that they know that are inch act like you and they're always there just friends you know Jeff right now for like dude I so got to get into tack what should I do and most of our customers here in Seattle come through that word of mouth cuz they're like wasn't even talking about getting into Tech just go take the code fellows the code 101 course and decide whether it's really for you
not so our demographic is really people who are in that career transition we still stick up some stacks witcher's and people who are coming out of a CS degree but don't have the finishing school skills to get into JavaScript or the other place they want they want to work with the skill set to pick up a few of those as well but she look at the center of our bell curve is really goes to wear sweaters and said they're coming from places like law and Hospitality you said what what other areas are they coming from around technical roles but they are specifically in non-technical rules that maybe I'm a sysadmin or I'm in QA tester and I'm in the product side but I'm not a product manager so we seen a lot of folks to come in on the product side who want to be more technical they may end up not being in a coder in the traditional sense but they may end up being a rockstar product manager because now they understand the scope that it takes actually build the thing you're talking about
and bridge the gap between the coder and in the business people who generally don't have a clue about how much it takes to build something new influx of people who are learn-to-code amps up the supply side of the job market place what about the demand side are there a rising I mean obviously where is the demand coming from like woo-hoo are the companies that really have a desperate desire to hire graduates of these boot camps yeah but if you look at the masks that we saw from horse report here just recently the math basically said if every computer science program across the country increase by 50% we meet at roughly 35 or 40% of the total demand for tech jobs
Chef you then add H-1B visas to it that's another 2% of age of the jobs which still leaves you somewhere greater than 50% of the jobs that are available if all the codes schools across the u.s. doubled we might get to 50% so I think one of the trends that we see you there there's both for us are grants typically go to mid-market companies so they go to an Expedia or something like that on Facebook today but they are going to mid-market companies in the case of an Expedia please acquired a bunch of different company so they need a lot of different stack experience but ultimately the stack experience is less important the specific stack experience for the code grads are code fellows got some ticular it's really about the desire to learn change and be aggressive about your career so if you take one of our gratitude is a 30 year old single mom who is switching careers show going into
you for that job I guess they're freshly minted CS grad who knows how to play guitar and juggle but doesn't have any real-world experience while you'll find is that sells gravel do really well in those interviews because they're it just came in at 10 weeks of getting their butt kicked their super aggressive about it they were working as a team they have real-world experience and what they're trying to do is really find a great career opportunity for themselves it doesn't say that she has an important by any means I just totally important and it's just a matter of their Decker really apples and oranges a bunch of shows about coding bootcamps and one question that always comes up is what is the value of a coding bootcamp versus the value of traditional college so when you talk to people from coding bootcamps and people who have graduated with computer science degrees
or maybe people hooked on both how I mean how do they compare and just Jeff from your experience in the field yeah I definitely need of the senior person who has a CS degree from a great school are going to be super high demand because they now more than just a specific stacker language they know algorithms and how to think about structure and database and that experience is invaluable I can but I think of some of our veterans who are coming out of four years of a tour of Duty and don't really want to go back to another 4 years of structure to finish their Siesta great and maybe they work their way through college and couldn't get into the Cs school so for for that profile of a person that they have the intelligence to do it they have the ability to do it there quick study I'm so getting into a 10-week program that gives them a chance instead of taking two years to focus on CSI can spend 10 weeks focus on a particular stack
that's what you're bringing in real-world experience and Leadership and training to say Okay I want to go get a job in this field so I don't think you know they're clearly not CS grads and that's not the way we portray them and one of the folks in our industry some of our competitors will talk about all we want to reinvent the way education is done whether education needs to be reinvented or not it's a different topic what we're doing is job Readiness for highly motivated people who want a career with an upside so they're very different functions they have the same title in some cases when they when they're done there going to be a developer Junior developer or full stack developer experience is totally different boot cast versus College things like you got a boot camp on one side and it's like 10 or 15 or 20 weeks and then on the other side of the spectrum you've got College
and it's like 5 years and it's like obviously these things are going to be totally orthogonal there like I think I think I was making too early on when I was doing these days the show these shows on different boot camps and I was like look at the results of his boot camp graduates in August I was a little bit envious cuz I went through college my 5 years of college and and I look at these boot camp graduation their graduating they're making awesome apps to doing all the cool stuff that I like to do when I when I finished my degree and they got the skills in like 12 weeks I was a little envious and it made me a little resentful of college but as things have progressed a kind of realize that these are really like pretty orthogonal experiences totally kids right now who both happen to be in code school by the way that you know college is typically it's a lagger as it relates to great jobs great skill set so even though the things that they're teaching today at some of our competitors like you know the University of Phoenix is still teaching
sidemen skills will AWS is vaporize that entire market so what they've been good at is they've been good at taking people's tuition but not delivering on the promise of getting people jobs chewing College are both my a twenty-three-year-old in 20 year old are currently in code School the 2300 finishes associate's degree in as a musician and the 20 year old is taking a break from his side is second year of college to take code school because he's he's much more of an entrepreneur and is much more likely to be doing a startup a year from now then being a college that's great sorry they attending just so happens over here at Cabela's okay awesome interesting you are really dog food in your product I see it is definitely the case I did Jeff early on when I came here was you know before one program or what we originally car developed accelerator is that 10-week program you were talking about his stack specific so we do iOS JavaScript and
Arabian python in front end of ux UI is the five Stacks but what would be 18% of the people into that program
 and we so we basically in August and September ritual their curriculum to say how do I get people ready for that program cuz what you find is if you think of the average person being in a 25 to 35 year-old I'm motivated I'm willing to do a classes at night or during the day I'm quitting my day job to pursue a new career and Tack so I'm highly motivated to finish it's not about the grade it's about getting the job so we introduce a new program called the code 101 it's a one-day $99 course we feed them it's 10 hours long they got to experience what codes will be like and they really going to try to answer the question is this for me or not so we have people come in and talk about careers and tag we have two guys talk about their experience and code school and we really want the answer is this isn't for you awesome right cuz we're not in the business of taking tuition where the business of getting people jobs
 what's tuition on the opposite end of the spectrum of college there are online courses and then somewhere somewhere in between sets coding bootcamps like code fellows but these online courses you know you mentioned University of Phoenix AZ kind of over-promising and under-delivering are there online courses that are actually worth it like ones where you have to pay where students will get really good results so I think there's some amazing ones if you remember a couple years ago like Coursera and all the universities were concerned the Mooks were going to put them out of business things we learned in the maturation of that process was that the movie where the business of delivering online content but people just don't finish the on my contacts only 2 to 3% of the people who actually start of course actually completed those courses for cheap I learn PHP and HTML CSS
 do an online course and I found out later I was in the 3% of people actually finished it so you got online you got to say to you have hybrid courses the jury still out there it's a question of if I'm motivated can I do distance learning a combination of online and offline and I think the answer is I think I think it will still out there and then you have the boot camp experience which is immersive full-time you know our students in there in courses are in a spend 60 hours a week so they're very focused on the course while their hair his homework every day they're working individually but they're also working on teens and also working on projects and I think one of the challenges you have and we see it all the time in our Portland office with zip code Oregon Labs is code Oregon is a program for Oregon State residents were they get to use treehouse for free the challenges as you get to a point when you get stuck in your eye
 nobody you can ask so could Oregon Labs is a weekly glad that we run for people that are part of code Oregon where they can come in and meet with a guy like you and they don't have to be an instructor they could be one of our garage or one of our TA is your stomach is just an instructor to volunteer and it's free for them because it's a chance for them to get unstuck and you know that's that if you don't know where to go look on stack Overflow for something or you don't know where to find something I get Hub having somebody who can help you do that is amazing so immersive programs of thing is so critical about I have to work with other people everyday I have to deliver a project at the end of the project term so weak 5 and we chat about project weeks and even our 201 and 301 courses before we courses you still have this the fourth week of both of those are still projects so if you're a hiring manager or your part of somebody's team and you're doing interviews of a code school grad the question is not just can you coat and can you write you know do a whiteboard test which I think is completely on a really
 thanks for the job placement Market it's due is this person somebody I want on my team right am I going to have to push them or is there somebody here like while they're really asking great questions and then bring it back I think one of the things I love about boot camps is the rigor and the expectation and this is like a baked into the phrase boot camp would you like when I think about an army boot camp like an army boot camp his mother is about teaching discipline it's not teaching you how to shoot a gun and so I mean I'm curious as a CEO of a boot camp do you have to become more of a disciplinarian for your students cuz it seems like you know you it's not like you're not teaching computer science mean there are elements of the computer science but you're teaching your finding a way to get people a job and I think a lot of that is really about discipline he starts off with her
 front end interview process Jeff is one of the things that we do is we will have feedback to get right and in most cases what you have is you have a a culture and an employment world out there that isn't used to the binary world or the shame of a get another ability shame somebody and get right so did I say about the code world I was just laughing with one of their 201 galaxies out 50% of our current students in this class or women and I heard this but it doesn't work it doesn't work there's no hiding from that in this industry right this is the thing I love about being around a meritocracy is if you can write code it doesn't matter whether you went to Junior College or somewhere else or school right what matters is can you do the job or not now I would love it if I would say it's you know we we don't see other things we don't see each other we don't see we still do
 this is more of a meritocracy than any any other opportunities I've ever worked for so we interview people the front of the process and we say listen if it could be hard for you to get a job because I'll pick on one of the 10 topics I wrote a blog post about the 10 reasons you won't get a job write your answer to everything or you need to bathe or you know your mustache wax is more important to you than getting a great job if you are a kick-ass dab you can be as quick as hell if your brand new Cuda school grad you have to put some of the quirky aside go get a kick-ass job to amazing work for an amazing company as hell but somebody needs to tell you that up front so in the interview process if we think there's going to be things that will keep you from getting a placement and we track replacement really really acutely by in the morning give me that feedback and if you don't like the feedback you don't have to come here because we don't want your tuition we want you to get a job
 the things you're doing okay keep you from getting a job we're going to tell you so it during class you're being disruptive you're not be a good team member I will let people know intractable let him know first Hey listen if you keep doing this where we're going to we're going to fire you and we'll just give you a pro at a refund on your guy nutrition right or if you're going to tap out tap out will give you a ride because it's about getting the job is not about getting a grade
 and I think that's the great thing about the development of the code schools in general but I need as fun for me to come in every day and hear people's stories and we have graduation we don't we don't call him demo days or just at the graduation people come in and talk about I was doing this and now I'm doing this and you know this is the change my life angle on it is definitely the draw for me is a CDL I came from two and a half years in a non-profit Global which is startup weekend and start of America's murder weekend events worldwide rain and I was like, what am I going to do when I get to make a difference in people's lives everyday and the answer was this was a great landing place for me now does it mean that we should take people's tuition just to take people's tuition absolutely not she's not nervous on our core values of who we are we want people to get jobs in a decimeter challenges with ADHD have people who come in who should know Tech is more of a meritocracy show me who is a transgender person who wants to get a job and Tack will the hiring manager
 I'm differently even though they shouldn't well can I cut colored or not is the first question I love that we get to start with can I do the job and then I still have to work through those issues but at least I know with you Kendrick old school you're going to be able to do the job yeah okay so let's talk some about the coursework what are the languages that code fellows classes are taught in
 so what you want classes HTML CSS and JavaScript front end it's really an intro prerequisite class that really is around website development. Web app development so that first 4 weeks is really prerequisite II 4 weeks are are 4 weeks or three o one class is designed around web app development so that's JavaScript front end JavaScript back in so the universality there is it's JavaScript to it true that way if we send you the iOS you're prepared for that as well so those are the prerequisites class and what we're fighting with that Jeff is that people will come in and say why can't take 10 weeks off I can do 18 weeks off but I but what I can do is I can do 4 weeks old timer 8 weeks old timer 16 weeks part-time stove for the person who's really in a and I've got them work as I've got a family I still want to do this part time
 and I'm switching them careers from one job at 15 bucks an hour in Hospitality to another job at 15 bucks an hour and Tack but at least I have upside in the tech industry sign those are really prerequisites we don't do the job offer guarantee while I'm with with those courses because they're really prereqs then on the 401 courses or will you spell develop accelerators there's five Stacks that we teach on so iOS we haven't watched the Android class yet but we expect you in the not-too-distant future you actually my so I'll front end of Ruby Python and JavaScript for somebody who has never ever written a line of code if they want to come in to code fellows they take the code 101 which is like $99 for one day and then they go if Progressive the 201 which is how much is 4 weeks it's $3,500 plus the front-end web
 if they proceeded into that if they go through the the 301 which is 4 weeks and $4,500 install back an API database and then then they are able to choose their stack and this accent is a 10 week $12,000 quarters 97% placement rate for that course 94% at 90 days and 97% at 9 months so tell me more about the curriculum like is it project-based how do you what are the keys to teaching boot camp students so the first so if you look at a 10-week program week 5 and we 10 or both project weeks so if you look at the first 4 weeks that's prepping them for the first project so if you take IOS as an example they may do the same project in week 5 and we can but for the most part they're different projects
 the project scope is going to be less than a week 5 and then I try to still be greater in WeChat the process of doing this cuz originally that felt a lot like a startup weekend so I've been head down writing for 4 weeks and there's like three it's project league pitcher project like a starter on a Friday night really why is Dave here's my project idea let's do a my keg is empty in my Kegerator app it's like okay well that is a project it's just not a very interesting project and what I mean by interesting is not is it fun to build its when I go tell hiring manager about the project by work done and we 5 and we are the project interesting and does it require me to stop and think about solving a problem vs. jumping and just coding first so one of things were working on is x-rated project list and we're working with a number of nonprofits here locally to create a list of nonprofits for the 201 is an example or so I can if she knew any website
 show me the list of nonprofits and you actually have something in your portfolio this not just a portfolio piece is actually a meaningful life used peace and the same is true on the website for 3:01 right can we build something using open data architecture and have to. Or have to Central District for the city of Seattle where there's there's an app that we created no one would ever create because there's no money in it so as you look at that gun going into the 401 the idea of curated problems starts off with here's an interesting problem to solve so I was working with google.org Global before I left and whether things we talked about was if I go blind person I have to take a different bus away Orient myself when I get off the bus to know which way is north
 it's something about your phone a smartphone consol we can just jump in and program an app you have to think about the hard problem you're trying to solve first so what I love about those is the week 5 and we 10 and you have to stop and you can just jump in and code something and go here's my you know here's my silly app you have to stop and think about it and say what would I do to solve this problem and the thing I love there is that then when I go in interview with Jeffrey my hiring manager you can say hey what what did you go that's really interesting prompt and it started off with here's the picture of the problem I'm trying to solve and then as a team we had to form for the team leader was we had to break up the tasks we had to do the Lean Startup methodology up to doing it done right so there's a whole bunch of things that are not true that process. Just tired around how am I going to work with my daily stand-up like I'm going to report stuff back do they make things work or not work when it broke what can I do about it so those are the things I love
 Southern super practical side of what we teach in addition to you know here's a line of code make sure you can copy it post it to get are going to manage it. Those things I wouldn't work what happened over Thanksgiving I had a great idea for a web app so instead of spending time with my family I locked myself in a room and I started building this application using Express JS because I love full stack JavaScript so I was testing my application locally and it was making great progress so I decided to deploy it and share it with some of my friends and get some feedback I used digitalocean I sign up for an account using promo code SE daily and in 15 minutes I had my app deployed to a server and running it was that simple this was really the first time I had used it your lotion so if you're like me and you like building stuff and you have ideas for projects give digital OSHA
 I shot it is the fastest and simplest way to the point application that I've ever used if you want to give it a try go to digital ocean.com and use the promo code SE daily to get $10 in free credits check it out
 does code fellows right much software to support this boot camp experience or as much of it just like kind of curriculum or what what kind of stuff are you guys creating to support the experience so where is the curriculum and then we use the Cricut management software in the rest of it just our own home ground things but even even keeping the coursework fresh from session session Jeff is important cuz there's a lot of you know all the 201 work from the the last 201 class is posted on get so this current class could come in if we don't keep it fresh and doing different things it would be in a knot that there will have a code of conduct that precludes them from, but if it's if the only curriculum if a curriculum never changes from course of course that's kind of a problem
 are still teaching and I don't like necessarily a terrible thing but I think it's kind of like you know it's kind of disingenuous in a sense cuz it's like rails is the most desirable jobs are not in rails as well there's definitely people who have a bias to looking at pursuing a career in a startup rails as could be awesome
 but it's going to be because it does rapid prototyping well it's going to be because that's the best place to get a job we're looking at every month are placement rate what companies are hiring and who they're hiring and the JavaScript courses are the ones that fill up the fastest because we push people that direction of a listen to most desirable jobs are going to be here because I even the prototyping stuff is like that's not even really true about rails anymore take you could prototype in in all drivers could just as easily as you can prototype in rails and I don't know what bothers me about the boot camps are still teaching and rails is like it's just you know a lot of these in boot camp in French they don't know any better like if this is something it's pretty hard to suss out I guess it's still subjective like I'm maybe I'm going to get some Flack from some rails boot camp to this point but I really think that it's like you know it if you're going to charge students to be a boot
 happy Nation be giving them the the best tools anyway was people can't so you can always test into whatever program you want to get into it that so for example we're running or 301 right now we have two people that after the first few days said I need to jump back to the 201 I'm not ready by test it into it but I'm not ready for it the same is true with the 401 so you going to come test into the 401 JavaScript if you don't test into it you can go take the 3:01 if you feel like you need to go back and take a shower when you can do that our goal there again it's not about the tuition it's about the can you do the work or not and I think to your point and he cares and here's our industry as a whole has a historic reputation for-profit universities placing her giving people dated curriculum that is going to help them get a
 yeah and I think that's what I still get a dated job right or it helps um you know for example I think some of the universities are still stuck in that to write his sister this is the coursework and teach you how to build a website of / 12 weeks of a quarter and it's like 12 weeks really with all the tool that their you need 12 weeks to teach me how to build a website that's crazy you know it sucks look into other markets like it's just got back from Brazil we're looking at opening an office there the challenge players in the computer science programs is they don't teach any current relevance tax they only teach computer science out of the book as the professors will be teaching Theory they're not actually colors so all of our instructors are actually coders rather than professors
 yes oh okay this is another one of these like touch points that I always encounter in these bootcamp discussions the difference between theory and practice my perspective on this having gone through computer science at University of Texas and also having worked a bunch of jobs internships writing my own projects my perspective is that there this whole Theory practice dichotomy doesn't really exist and the reason I say that is because we're at a point where computer science is so baked into everything but like this any anything you're discussing and computer science even from a theoretical perspective it has a practical application so if you are teaching something is theory that is because you are structuring it in a way that is so far removed from the practical application that you're making a mistake
 so if you want to actually teach something that is like very theoretical like you can teach machine learning from a very theoretical standpoint and teach proof surrounder teach distributed systems for a very theoretical standpoint with lots of proofs you can do that that's fine but I think it does generally does a disservice to students because you could just be teaching them an applied version you Petition of practical version but I don't know I mean I'm curious what your thoughts are on you know Siri versus practice Yeah that mean you know my experience and education for adult education has been all around startups in my experience which I think is if you look at a student and she was taking an entrepreneurship course to the university and they have 12 weeks to get through the course work right at 7 week 8 I need to be in chapter 10. I have a shity idea then I'm going to start over again in the real world right cuz it's not a
 finishing the grade so and teaching theory about entrepreneurship is different than getting out and actually talking with customers and doing it but it parallels very much the same I think there's a question of you know when you tell somebody here's the problem here is how we're going to Cheers a way to approach it and then in the context of that you teach them the theory as well and there's that A-ha moment as an instructor so anyway any of us who taught in your chair probably never eat you do it because there's those aha moments right where you watch the sooner like oh I finally get it right you're like I tell my kids there's a difference between talking about photosynthesis and talking about maple syrup maple syrup and then you smell that they relate to the question is yes I learned a serious about photosynthesis it's cool
 right I just I love it when there's that aha moment for the students and that's the stuff that keeps our instructors coming back everyday is watching the lightbulb go off where you're like they totally got it today how effective are your instructors compared to computer science professors
 I didn't know I need to schedule with the u-dub some parts of the u-dub I want to hear but it's amazing and I think it will take out another hundred and fifteen students a year which is great it's a good it's a good help and they don't think we're going to buy cars work and all I can remind him of his brain and I think there are definitely people in our industry Jeff who are you know there's the articles that sell and get if you put a head on this day Parker from code fellows says all computer science programs are horrible right you'll get a lot more readership and Views then if you said that he thinks there's a place for both of them right so there's regretfully the clickbait side of this debate says
 it's either one part I think if you look at the market opportunity for students in the answer is it took his Claim about our instructors are passionate about being structures that are passionate about being doors and coders as well so we'll see people who will will instruct for 2 years and then go take a job with a desire to come back if they want to keep their skills fresh they want to work an interesting projects and someone I hope will come back but not all of them there's a student in a computer science program at of University listening right now and
 she's wondering what is the best way to I mean you said there's room for both right there's room for University in this room for these coding bootcamps how can that student suss out whether or not she should be in college or whether she should be in a coding bootcamp
 yeah that's all I think we Peter teal is none Alliance I can't say you should go drop out I think it depends on where you're at in life right now so if I look at most college tuition programs a state school here at University of Washington or Western Washington University will be $20,000 a year so versus $12,000 for a bootcamp class so College was great I loved it it was some of the best learning I had most of it wasn't in class Life Learning life experience all those things were amazing so I would say if you know colleges in your experience and you want to go have it and you can afford to do that then you should definitely do it if however you're the point in life where you may be a little bit older and you're not you can't take 2 years off with for years I have to go back to school this is just an alternative choice
 is it still expensive yes regretfully is not very accessible yet one of the questions were trying to answer which is more accessible how do we become for example to Tom's Shoes of coding schools like for every person pays the category night train somebody International an emerging world right super interesting idea don't know the answer to it yet but come on heart perspective it's like you know that would be amazing because it if software is eating the world and
 you know and reasons right it says that the ability to take software into Marcus that have never experienced software before and fundamentally change and transform a company in a market in an individual's life in perspective our mission is it software will change people's lives companies in community and if we can keep doing that if you have an amazing impact so I didn't check your questionnaire for a minute depending on where that person is in their life the answer is this is just an alternative method it's not going to get you as far ahead in your CS degree as you will by going to the four years but to your point in talking to it to your point earlier it is going to give you a chance to start a career in tack which put you in at the bottom entry level of a trajectory into an industry that could change the world and if you want to go do that and this is a great place for you
 one thing I think about is like if if the student wants to stay I mean the motivation for staying in college I can that I can pick up his like versus a boot camp was like oh if I stay in college I can take courses on machine learning or courses on database architecture or something it's you can't you can't really get that out of a coding bootcamp but what I think about is like if you're doing that stuff in school through learning that stuff in a university if that's your goal I mean wouldn't you be better served going through a boot camp quickly Sea-Doo can get an industry and actually see this stuff in practice and I don't know anyway that's it that's it we don't need to I think the real question is that you know when you my experiences with entrepreneur is if you talk to an entrepreneur class in college and you talked with starting with the idea of straight with a problem Bennett
 solution to problems they come up with our new dating apps because they don't have enough Real World experience to look at problems and inexperience Inn Express him in other ways and it doesn't mean he's not a problem right but it doesn't also mean that we need more dating apps right so if you get somebody who's been in the military and served four years and two tours and they just look at the world different right I think it's a Corvette Jeff what school will about software the things that we love about it is when you take somebody from a different industry and you drop them into with cs experience into an Expedia they don't look at the world differently and I'm a little bit How I build software different solution differently I love that right because you know as you've probably done too if you want you switch Industries you come from where I came from the wireless industry virgin length and switch in the software in Wireless we just saw stuff differently and I will look at the way software guys were doing it
 why you doing it that way we did this happen at this way differently for years right and I think that's the thing that I love about this just Target demographic is I've got real world at problem solving experience and skills and bring it into the solution and that's going to fundamentally change the type of product we build and that's pretty cool I came from from playing poker professionally so I'm always marveling at the inability of software Engineers to take risks but many of them are able to take rest which are the ones who I love becoming friends with but so military people for example you guys have a drive to get scholarships to bring on military people tell me more about scholarships what are the kinds of students that receive a scholarship tuition and where are the scholarships coming from a little over 6 months ago 250,000
 scholarship campaign of which refunded $180,000 already from what used to be where we call hiring Partners so folks like Expedia and Tablo and what those companies are after is they want more women minorities and veterans that they see through the process and what they're not willing to wait for us or not willing to fix K through 12 education and college education first in order to get those candidates jobs and Tack so what they do is they donate to the scholarship campaign is called the Pay It Forward scholarship campaign we then find those students qualify at 70% of tuition into the programs
 so they application process is this year and just has to apply let us know they have any new FAFSA or anything like that it's just one question in your application process we had asked you if it if you do would be would needed to have a scholarship to come to the program is interesting isn't a little bit awkward in some ways because we don't we're not looking at their financial data right so it could be something you can afford it for someone who can't afford it and make sure we make you make a scholarship go as far as we can so then it's at 70% funded so 70% of the full-time classes only we don't do that you need for the weekend classes at this point I'm for that to 7% of the full tank last one so they could come through and do the two on 301 and 401 and get 70% of each of those we think you need to have some skin in the game
 because if we register from personal experience and Entrepreneurship if you give stuff away for free those will be your highest rate of people who quit so we're still trying to find a mix for that so you done the same thing in Oregon we raised $60,000 in Oregon we raised a hundred and I think it's hundred seventy of the 250 here and we'll keep raising funds against that we have Partners like Tablo Whodunnit you at every quarter and then when they hire to hire someone they donate again so it really is a if they don't hire somebody that quarter they just roll it into the next quarter and it's not there's not a one-to-one ratio so we're not selling Jeff into indentured servitude at a blown but the folks from Chapel I want to come meet with those candidates halfway through the process and begin to build relationships with them so they can see this is why you should consider Chapel up so we're super excited about that we've it's just ramping up we have some of our first he said this class Ivar 201 is 50% women
 with the words getting out and we're seeing more people who are coming in I think in the case of the military we did our first 101 class at on Joint Base Lewis-McChord last month and cycle there's going to be we need to open an office in to come as part of our plan were considering right now to make it more accessible to them need to go to where they are not just expect them to come to South Lake Union okay so the 50% women thing is really interesting like is that how did you get that how do you have 50% women taking your code fellows classes
 I wish I could tell you so I can replicate it for the next one I just happen to be in this one that's been averaging about 20% and going up in this particular class I guess it 201 is a front-end web dev class just the start of our final any one of the things that we've done is we've been very deliberate and reaching out to meet up groups another they were folks are there going to be upset you have an option for me you know we have women on staff we have women instructors more than half of my management team are women so I think it's one of those where people get here and go so it's not out of you know it's not a brogrammer mentality location of shows about women and Tack and
 it was not easy to approach it correctly and like initially I was like I did not have exactly the correct frame of mind on things so I'm curious as to white males and tech let's talk about women attacked I mean what is what do you think is the problem like what's or are we solving the problems or what what do you how do you see the the cultural landscape these days and not wait for other people to solve it so I'm for me it's a partner with not a do it for you know I'm surrounded by a bunch of strong women in my life my mom was a single mom I've been married for 28 years I anyone have to be married to me for that one Chloe is a strong woman so there's you know what I see right now is making it accessible for people and giving him an alternative you
 now if you're trying to get a job at Google they're going to hire from Stanford if you're trying to get into Stanford CS the odds of getting in as a woman up real loud because of that the market knows the odds of me getting her very slim is that a bad thing when it's sad but it's going to take time to change it's going to take years to change cuz there's a there's a system in place
 and so any one of those there for Jeff for me is Shark Week end Google challenge just a couple years ago to change our to change the approach we had to get any money from the start of weekends and that you're able to go from 20% to 37% I mean in attendance and was like very deliberately reaching out and inviting them and including them I think there's also some cultural norms we have to be aware I would like if you do a startup weekend women's edition and by that I mean it we went with 80% women versus 20% women what you would find is the women will wait to picture ideas until the end and you have to continue to courage encourage folks to go ahead now you know don't you know cuz dude step up and be aggressive and right in the women or way our culture is a culture that shows in a historically hey you should just wait your turn right and that's not great but it is a reality
 Sonic contrast that with I have an 8 year old daughter we adopted from China so I have three boys and we adopt a little girl whose now 8 she will give up on stem education by this time next year if I don't encourage her not to that's tragic tragic so so for me it's a bit of a personal mission right Dave code and so what can I do as an individual so I look at this whole topic and go or certain dials I can impact as much as I can to I can't change Stanford's process I can't change that medication in Bellevue School District what can I do well I can scholarship women into programs I can go to Every meet up and has women involved with it and ask them to participate I can have women on my team go out and show them that it's not just a bunch of white dude to her who were in computer science so other things I can control
 switch way to control those things does that make me you know awkwardly in conversation with folks it's true women is true with friends is true of the African Americans and minorities we have wrestling foundation will work and what to get your voice out there to tell people in the Central District about you know we have access to this program for minority Zantac and you know we had a really interesting and awkward initial discussion with wrestle around hey what's recognize the fact that I'm a white dude right and we're just trying to do the best we can we don't have the answers I'm not coming with the answers I'm just coming in I have I have one hammer and a certain things I can and I can't change boosters other people to work on that they're doing amazing things but working with Russell has been terrific because not only is it fun to watch him play football for the Seahawks but it's fun to have a guy who
 came back and he was running football camps and he realize the football camps weren't really making a difference in those kids lives and they decided that this is the way he wanted to go make a difference in those kids lives so I will get behind anybody that wants to do something like that and I'll help them how it's just like sad that these women exits stem so early but now he's it's sad and it's like a total waste it's like super brain drain you know the the idea of of needing diverse thought in the field of software or stem in general like we did it so anyway yeah I mean that's that's great I like everything so there's a time we know if they're two to figure out and said this is this is the hour of code week this week so there's there are places you can go this week to go volunteer as a coder and teach code to elementary school and middle school kids by just to get involved
 give back and there's there's not enough of that yet but it's moving the right way and I would encourage those folks you know if you don't have kids it's okay you can still get involved and we'd love to have you there not a great way to mobilize those folks yet regretfully but I'm I'm encouraged to because I see the things that are happening there and it's better than it was 5 years ago and you know what in 5 years old be better still and for that it's it's something you know I think there's a legacy for our generation of people and Tack to say what difference did we make cuz right now it's easy to say I'll let you know I was up a panel with Congressman last week for the WTA wrong it was appropriately so focused on the fact of it what can be our legacy to this generation be focusing on eye that I think it is that's where you and I can go back in
 great well that seems like a pretty good place to close off Dave Parker thank you so much for coming out to software engineering daily is there do you have any like closing thoughts or suggestions or comments about coding bootcamps putting education in general software
 yeah I think that the only thing I can say is if you are a listener and you have a friend who's always nagging at you about they need to make a career transition tell him to come to the code 101 and I and give it a try and then I'll either stop talking to you about it it'll actually pursue a career in Coach purse with us or somebody else Sarah Jeff thanks for your time I appreciate it today have a great day

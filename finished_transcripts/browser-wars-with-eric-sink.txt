Transcription: internet-explorer google-chrome Firefox it is easy to forget that these modern browsers descended from the war between Microsoft and Netscape Eric sink was one of the original developers of spyglass a browser that was licensed to both Microsoft and Netscape if you want to understand why this happened a browser licensing to both Microsoft and Netscape and what the inside story of the browser Wars is and what the business of selling browser licenses in 1992 was like stay tuned and we will get to the story after a quick message from the sponsors that make this show possible
I love being a software engineer because of how easy it is to build side projects and I built countless side projects I build a Social Gambling application a dating website back in the head zero users stock trading music rhythm application for Android and I think every developer should have side projects so when I have web app that I want to deploy and share I want to show my friends my most recent project that nobody will care about I use digitalocean to quickly spin up a server and host my projects and who knows if one day one of my apps takes off and goes viral and people actually do care I can easily scale using digital oceans flexible pricing plan companies like taskrabbit that have grown rapidly have used digitalocean for this very reason but until this happens I will happily stick with the $5 a month plan sign up with promo code SE daily to get a free $10 credit
is a listener of our show and start building your apps we would love to see what listeners build so send us an email showing us your project I've also interviewed moisey oretsky who is the co-founder of digitalocean and he mentioned that the ease of use and the flexibility is why they built the service in the first place that digitalocean in interview is one of my favorite episodes noisy talk about bleeding in a Datacenter he says you don't know how hard it is to do a cloud hosting service on until you bleed in a Datacenter it's really interesting that was speaking which let's get on with this episode of software engineering daily
Eric sink is a software developer and blogger Eric welcome to software engineering daily or a key player in the browser Ward back in the 90s and you're part of the team that built the browser that got licensed or became Internet Explorer this story starts with you joining a company called Spyglass in 1992 what was going on in your life when you join Spyglass I was working for a government research lab and I was not unhappy with my job but this opportunity came up it looks kind of intriguing at the time Spyglass was not ring browsers they were focused on data visualization tools
and are they thought of their Reno of their business model as commercializing things that came out of the University of Illinois friends encouraged me to kind of castelein in that water and just see what happened I ended up getting the job and enjoyed enjoyed working on data visualization. I thought it was signing up for a minute I was happy enough interesting business model to Define your company as as commercializing stuff that comes out of Academia will happen if you still companies that are built in that model that still happens the the world has changed quite a bit of the universities are generally trying to get a bigger share of the pie your things like Patton's upcoming to play and then back when we did it
business that way but not for what they now call Tech transfer they they have licensing departments and they have resources to spawn startups and resources to get a revenue stream off of the technology they license and things like that sucks it's become a really big deal and playing in since like that give me some perspective on the general world of software engineering Circa 1992
1992 it was that's an interesting question V
 certainly I mean you're talking about a world where 32 bit Windows wasn't there yet
 I was at the time very much a Mac or Unix guy and in those days those were different back was not you looks like it is today so I did I had done no windows programming because I stayed out of Windows until the 16-bit world was over I was kind of a Mac fan but that was Mac OS 9 or earlier in 1992 was probably more like Mac OS 6 and Percy cplusplus was nothing like what it is today it was it was relatively new exist but it was
 I was just saying how dominant was Microsoft and what was the framing of Microsoft versus apple or vs IBM or whatever I mean this is before my time so I'm totally unaware of what the competition space look like Microsoft was nothing like it was and certainly nobody thought of them as the dominant player like people did 10 years later that was the year when
 honestly, you're talking about Windows 3.1 was was there and so you would think of Microsoft in that day as the company who just was wrapping up defeating Lotus 1-2-3
 and they were just wrapping up the defeat of os2 from IBM
 apple apple desktop was totally incredible player right okay so around the time you join Spyglass Spyglass originally you thought you were just to be building scientific data analysis tools when did Spyglass decide to shift to building web browsers and it was a combination of two factors one was that Spyglass was vc-funded and in fact it was something you don't see anymore which one which is that it was top to your VC money here in Champaign Illinois which is a ton of a hundred thousand you are not going to see Sandhill Road BC use are or Greylock investing in companies that are not next to a major airport anymore but that was the world of the day
 and anyway those species were
 shall I say starting to wonder where their exit was a fine little business and would have been a completely successful business if they didn't have to pay back a venture capitalist and they they noticed this up-and-coming thing called the web
 and they noticed that the the Mosaic browser was written Matt NCSA the national Center for supercomputing applications which is right here in town and they said well we license the day or tools from NCSA maybe they would license us the browser so what was going on in the space of browsers more broadly.
 There was I mean this was really early there was the the original browser from Tim berners-lee steam in Switzerland and there was Mosaic and Mosaic was basically some students at U of I sat down with this idea of the web and said you know this would be really cool if we added a couple more images on forms that would be awesome and so they did that and it's sort of opened a lot of people's eyes to this could be more than just text it could be later when we started thinking of it as a fat one perhaps this is just the data do we have forms and those were the two big things about that
 Pinterest Spyglass started working on a web browser and it was it was a licensed version of Mosaic what does that mean what we basically what it meant was we license the name and the right to use any code as it turns out we ended up not using any of the code primarily because we wanted a cross-platform story from the beginning
 and Mosaic and its day was a Unix browser and a Mac version of which used a big application framework called my cat and it was a Windows version and those three teams didn't check up
 so it was it was it was because it was mostly so we more or less started from scratch and use the code as a reference but then also have the Mosaic name of the official licensing relationship from University and you know the name of the University Nation had some cash a to it and that's that was an asset building a cross-platform application typically means you build IOS app filter Android app you filter web app and there's some wall confusion between each of these teams building the individual app and things are kind of a nightmare so it's kind of understandable that you went to this direction even when the the cross-platform strategy and it wasn't his mobile
 how did you unify that application would what was what was that unification process like back in the day for us it was trying to share as much as we could Regency and so we had the portable section of Arco that we would compile unchanged on what we thought it was all three platforms and then be the UI Parts was Rewritten for every platform it's sort of like all three mobile phones or something like that or if you're writing your car code and Senior compiling it for iOS 7 for Android in your in your UI on Android isn't Java it was that basic model
 we were not using any of it to you like gooey abstraction Frame Works at the day like you know it is one of the ones that was popular at the time was xdt if this is way before things like cute see your cute however it's pronounced okay so how did the Mosaic spy glass Mosaic version that you ended up building how did that compare to the current browser that we have today so it was it was fantastically different much much simpler we didn't have so a bad day it really was just a text layout engine for rendering HTML it was it was images it was the ability to submit forms it was a history and a back button and this whole idea of JavaScript Dom
 I mean it those things didn't exist at all when we first started that we would take for Advantage take take for granted today
 what kinds of engineering what kinds of engineering would we take for granted or the browser that were difficult or challenging that today we would totally take for granted in p.m. install whatever so well for one thing we didn't have Version Control that works across platforms or over a network so
 I mean I'm talking about it's not just that we didn't have get we didn't have subversion and before that we didn't have CBS we had basically all we had was RCS which is this really old thing that CVS is a descendant of and so literally when we wanted to do version control operations on a Mac or Windows machine we would shell into a Unix machine and type RCS commands to get the code in and out and thirst you're not even a hint of things like package management or take for granted I guess so okay so you both to Spyglass or I guess we works you start cutting a few a few weeks after you started coding the spy glass Mosaic browser gym
 came into town for those who don't know who is Jim Clark made a bundle of money SGI Graphics which is a Unix workstation vendor from way back
 and to be honest I don't even know what made him want to jump into web browsers but what he did was he he came into town and hired the stuff from the U of I that we didn't get witches we license the technology but didn't hire any of the developers he went in leiston hired all the developers to create a startup and move them all the West Coast
 was Jim Clark a compelling leader in the way that we think of black Bill Gates or Steve Jobs
 well those are watching comparisons Steve was a technical Brilliance to them especially Gates I don't think of Clark that way but no I don't want to sell them in short he was he was obviously very well respected very much admired and a tremendous track record so I mean he's the kind of guy who could create Netscape but you know that came my impression is more from his leadership skills his connections is his role as an executive not so much for his role as either a technical Genius Like jobs who I don't think of him as either of those two
 okay so Jim Clark is he said eventually founded Netscape was was the Netscape business model the same that Spyglass have for the Spyglass Missouri it was in some ways I mean we were certainly competitors are different we went with what we called an oem business model where we wanted to license browsers to other companies were then going to sell those apps to to their customers
 nutscapes model when they were originally called Mosaic Communications until Spyglass on the U of I told them to stop using that name and that's what the Netscape name came out so far but they were they were more about delivering a browser to use
 Sprite OKC you had this OEM model were there enough corporations who would want your browser who want to license a browser
 well there were first and we certainly thought that would stay that way there we I mean if Spyglass was not as successful as they would like
 it would be because they underestimated the degree to which all of this would consolidate
 and you know so I think I have said in various places I don't know where but we had a hundred and twenty companies licensing are browser and putting their name on it and features whatever and using it and distributing their own web browser
 yeah and and you wrote in in his blog post I already said these 220 companies are so they licensed spy glass Mosaic and and they bundled into products like ATMs operating systems set-top boxes foreign concept to reality but why like why did such a broad variety of things need access to their own third-party browser ATMs and set-top boxes why these things need a browser they wanted it because it was just a different way for them to build our ATM software ATMs that are building software probably what happened is that some developers at Citibank steam when they were building there ATM's at hey this web thing looks like another way for us to try and do this but fundamentally do you want your ATM to be able to serve
 any website so that was not that issue however in 1995 who fought the TVs were going to be the primary way that people access the wet and those people were buying processors I see so where these companies like
 they bought the browser and then they just like experimenting with it and then they were paying you to license it while they were experimenting or do products actually like roll out using a browser in a weird way that would like totally for in today tipping was a set-top box basically it was a match
 and so okay so you're working on Spyglass Mosaic and Netscape and Jim Clark start competing with you tell me what it was like to be competing with Netscape around that time
 it was
 it was certainly
 interesting and I am very again I was young when I when I went through this and so mostly for me this was just a tremendous learning experience more than it was an opportunity for me to look at all the great wise decisions I made back then but we we were certainly being out spent was one thing and in terms of
 in terms of
 France and attention it it's it was true that it's still true today that's if you're Jim Clark and Silicon Valley you can get more attention and so he played this right from day one when he bought I should say hey guys he got for Marc Andreessen and Eric weiner a wizard of a programmer you stick him in a dark room and you make sure that there's room under the door to slide pizzas in
 it's almost immediately as far as I understand it they printed business cards to Eric you know that side unsung hero because he was he didn't get a lot of attention
 yeah I was Marc Andreessen kind of a product manager I don't really know what marks Hands-On roll was it's it's really strange to think of Mark M. Day compared to the Marc Andreessen week we should know today who is been so so successful as a businessman Adventure capitalist much older than I was and so I suspect he looks back on those days and think about how young he was compared to for the units version of Mosaic and NCSA I don't know if he wrote code when they went to Netscape or not my impression was always that he was more in a
 an outward facing role as opposed to a heads down roll Netscape got ahead of spyglass in terms of features what were the features that Netscape was rolling out that allowed them to to compete successfully against spyglass
 well certainly they got ahead of us pretty quickly on adding things that HTML you know it by 90 seconds
 so we started this in 94 I believe Netscape was founded in late 94
 the next several months were sort of a race to the NASDAQ because everybody started filing for IPO and everybody want to get on to the NASDAQ IPO happened in 95
 what I don't remember the timing of is that somewhere in there are customers mostly started telling us that they just wanted our browser to render things the way Netscape did regard
 and this was at a time when we had started to become involved in the standardization ever since I was the chair of the HTML working group within the ITF at one point we were we were at the first three w3c web conferences and I got to meet Tim berners-lee was now the legend and so far even as in the practical sense everybody really just wanted to be compatible
 so this is just the symptom of Jim Clark's influence
 I'd say that has to be part of it but it's also I mean I don't see that nefariously sure like you know he like you said he had the tendrils and influencing and you know if it's you know if it's if it's a race to shape public opinion and public perception then it sounds like Jim Clark was it was a good horse to have in that race yeah I would say that's certainly true one of the other things that I can't really recall the timing of is at one point I believe Netscape came out with their browser at forty bucks
 and you know we're not selling it at the product directly to come consumers were selling it to companies are pricing range from $0.55 in very high volumes up to like a box and then some company would charge of markup on top of that is like $0.55 flat per user abuser but at some point that's it stops charging 40 bucks for their browser
 tell me this was one of the very early experiments in using free software to gain to gain market share the code did not become open source until later yeah some to the problems at work like there's because people would want to embed a browser but the source code for what is now Mozilla wasn't out there and so if you want a better browser to buy something and so they can come to us and I would say wow this is great but this one's bifurcating into into in bed like where you at where Spyglass had the embedded browser market and Netscape had the consumer browser Market or was it not that clearly defined
 it was just everybody running around like crazy trying to close business deals and you set out to close one kind of business deal and you stumble across an opportunity that's totally different and you and you chase that instead and speaking of those kind of deals when did Spyglass decide to make a deal with Microsoft
 let's see when do they decide the timing of that I'm having trouble remembering exactly two but it was it was very early on I believe we were in discussions about that in points in 94 deal close to 95 right around the same time as our IPO if I remember correctly
 all of the Goshi ation was well above my paygrade I was just the developer and so when the when the deal was getting close I was the developer sent out to Redlands coordinate with her team and this one's this was all happening in the context of Windows 95
 so my boys becoming a forced to really be reckoned with yes yes Windows 95 but that was the OS that really took off for them into what it was like that experience where are you you visited Microsoft and worked some during the integration process that you had some very interesting points on how intense the the work environment sounded I what was it like what was it like visiting Microsoft during that time
 certainly it was crazy to me at the time because I was back in Champaign working some crazy hours myself sometimes but to go into an environment but you are my first trip to Redmond to work with the the Chicago team and it's not who was the codename for 195 by my first trip to to work with them and just leave the intensity was just everywhere and I think I said in one of my blog post it was just funny how people would work dinner will be served in the cafeteria then go down grab a bite they come back and they'd work until you know all hours of the night when everybody said if you joined Microsoft and could survive for 5 years you be a millionaire
 and you know that's just the way Microsoft was in that day lot of intensity
 a lot of stuff going on people it's inside Microsoft Word
 so this was a was it like a pressure cooker or was it like people were working their tails off because they were like genuinely impassioned about the company I'm really curious with the with the internal culture was like I never got the impression that it was like you know us guys on the bottom of the boat being whipped while I really why they pull the orange
 we're just really psyched about what they were doing
 interesting is that I've worked I work at Amazon and Amazon has a little of each offense to two people working at Amazon but there's a little or rowing but there's also plenty of genuine genuine excitement

 automate your investing get back to the things that you can't on me like writing code
 turning into a real browser war between Microsoft and Netscape
 being
 right around see I always think of I use for as the turning point so we license them
 the original browser and they and they went on to do i e 2 and 3 that we're all so very much based on our code
 but somewhere in there I hope I'm getting this right or are you somebody's going to call in your tank correct me but that's browser at Netscape first and
 originally it was just simple stuff I mean it was like Hey I want to attach a little JavaScript Snippets to this form control so we could do stuff
 and then it turned into during the I-84 and Netscape for product cycle it turned into the dump it turned into this this big platform where you could write entire programs that run inside your browser instead of a hypertext document viewer
 right so
 s things were heating up competitive people I hear this narrative that Microsoft did stuff that was like really nefarious and competitive and did Microsoft ever actually do anything that was anti-competitive
 well I mean
 certainly
 show me the doj. So it's hard to say hey pretty bad at software today presumably much worse it software back then or is that too naive way of thinking about where they were they more sophisticated that I'm giving him credit for that Microsoft including the browser in their in their OS was anti-competitive I never quite understood that that is certainly I didn't see it that way it seemed to me that natural thing to stick in an OS and if anybody should have sued them for being at a competitive it should have been fine last because I mean we had a hundred and nineteen other license ease a Microsoft destroyed the ball
 so I need to Spyglass has a business where we going to sue them for that maybe I got disgusted Jim Clark like phoning up
 burning up Congress and the Department of Justice and saying look you guys got to look into this thing or what exactly occurred I don't actually know how going I really don't and and I'm hesitate to draw on my big Recollections or speculation of after-the-fact my recollection though is that most of the anti-competitive big bad Microsoft stuff happened after I left spyglass
 and it will it it happens
 okay I presume that you don't Netscape felt like they were wrong certainly because I mean another thing I don't recall was that you know like I said I felt like the turning point
 and when I saved understand that that's
 Microsoft had a thousand people working on IE for business not viable it was Doom 2
 are there was really only one outcome that could come out of that kind of resource disparity
 so it's somewhere along the way there as Spyglass and it's business Wayne and started the pivot I left in 19 Burleigh 1997
 I don't remember the timing of of all the anti-competitive stuff but my recollection is that it happened after that and I wasn't paying that much attention you said that but okay if you also said in your blog post they're like of these 120 companies that licensed spy glass Mosaic so that they can bundle it into their product there were there were all these covered it you said like 119 of them at the the remaining one being actually Microsoft you know cuz you licensed spot to to clarify you license Spyglass to Microsoft so that they can use it to I guess they were using it as a reference or either they were they were implementing it or something but you said that these 119th companies were all in Bitter End by the fact that you were working with Microsoft because they were being squashed by Microsoft so maybe maybe Microsoft was actually just squash and that was Superior Products rather than
 practices well I mean where is the line between anti-competitive and just being big I mean I don't know what was the day that Microsoft had 90 to 95% market share on the desktop and
 absolutely when you stick a browser in your OS and you have 95% market share on the desktop anybody else trying to sell a browser probably is going to be very successful and is that is that anti-competitive or is that just big I don't know I mean that's a question for lawyers and I've always preferred to stay away from it but I do know that regardless I do know how that makes people feel it's and I certainly heard the gripes from
 you know from our other hundred and nineteen license East and they felt bad and they took some of it out on us and they they would you know they would contact why would you sell the Microsoft and we would say why would a bad because they're going to lose the deal with Microsoft was it that they were embeddings spy glass Mosaic as like I eat one. Oh or was it they got to see the code and uses reference of limitation what exactly was it the deal was was licensing it was of the technology and the name and the affiliation with U of I
 and they actually did use the Spyglass code
 I mean I don't remember we know for a fact that I E 2 and 3 were mostly Spyglass code and I-84 had some Spyglass code in it later I suspect it's gone I mean I don't know how long that lasted but they definitely ship barcode and for for quite a while the the about box with Internet Explorer had credits to both Spyglass and the University of Illinois as as licensing sources some interesting so there's some Modern internet businesses that are characterized as landgraab businesses like you look at Uber vs. Lyft people talk as if this is a winner-take-all market I think they're there been other other cases of this and I as a personal perspective
 sometimes these landgraab businesses are actually not as much as blank. Business as people frame them but and then but the company's get convinced it's a land grab business and then they position them such that it is a land grab business and they see this narrow point of view
 was that the case with the browser Wars like did the War 4 internet browser dominance get get perturbed by the fact that it was framed is a land grab business like is there an alternate future where you know Spyglass and Internet Explorer and Netscape all exists harmoniously and perform different functions or was this truly a land crab business when you're asking questions about things I wish I understood at the time I would talk to
 yeldi the exact who did the deal with Microsoft in the exact suit who would talk to Jim Clark you know competitively and I'm just the guy who's trying to make sure that I'm not double freeing a pointer in C so I didn't really have any business sense and so if there were conversations going on I certainly wasn't ready to them but I don't think that's the way anybody thought I think people would thought of it is it's just this new thing that everybody's trying to figure out where it's going to go
 and my initial reaction to the attempt any attempt to characterize it as a land grab is that I don't think anybody at the time and was I mean what would we grab are we grabbing document viewing or we grabbing are we grabbing the sap platform notion because at the time I mean we had everything from people who saw this as a way to build apps delivery mechanism for applications
 but at the time you know we had the the high-end document crowd wanting to know what why is an HTML document and to some extent that's view of the browser was consistent with Tim berners-lee original vision for the web that mean it was hypertext
 angles that didn't really become big but they were big it's not
 yeah there's been a lot of media coverage and storytelling around the browser Wars I read one book called the new new thing by Michael Lewis there's a number of other books and topics around this recognize that you're the guy that was trying to free a double pointer but you know you were involved first-hand so from your perspective what what did the media get wrong about the browser Wars and what what continues to get misunderstood or Miss told
 well if you know if I
 that's interesting
 certainly I think that the media Shine the Light on things that were interesting from a media perspective and there were other things that maybe you should have had a light shined on it but didn't get as much and so for example if I were if I would I would say I wish the Spyglass role as the Arms Dealer in this war work or more well-known I came out of it was a fairly decent sized pile of money and I have no regrets
 it's guys like Dave Thompson Dave T was one of the original NCSA guys you know somebody I forgot to get an article on Daisy because I realize you know this guy was like he was there he was he was an important part of this and I feel good about that because you know it was
 it was a little bit of unsung hero stuff going on with tape Thompson
 you know Eric Bina still you know to mean the the tale of the other guy on Unix Mosaic who didn't end up on the cover of Time Magazine. I always I always liked hearing more about Eric peanut but the Press likes writing more about Jim Clark and Jim would steer more of the press towards Marc Andreessen at least that would be my understanding and so you know it's the Press it's it's just the way it is stuff coming out of the press that was just wrong but it was it was a little bit more of a distance to you and it was it was a little bit more of a storytelling
 yeah I mean Ice I sometimes feel that these days this the storytelling you like that's that's one of my motivations with software engineering daily is and I read these texts journalism sites and it's always disliked acerbic often cynical mean oh poor poor technical understanding of what's going on and it just like it it makes me like want to bring more clarity to the situation sometimes so anyway let's start wrapping up I guess by talking about the present what what do you working on lately that it gets you excited as I said I left Spyglass in 97 and found my own company and and actually I'm still running it so we've been in business for about 19 years and we've done a whole bunch of different things
 Long Way currently we're like everybody else we're focused on mobile and we have this product where we do data synchronization of dude on your mobile device to data on the back of the of the cloud and that's that's been fun because there's an interesting technical challenges there as well as some
 some definite business opportunities and so that's that's always been a good fit for us you know what I've been personally taking an interest in how should I describe the languages that language F sharp and Russ languages functional programming I've taken an interest in things that don't necessarily get a lot of mainstream attention in the commercial world and there was just because I enjoyed eating things and part of my addresses also wondering you know how does one predict which of those things become mainstream overtime and you what would it take for one of them to go then she seems to be the Bellwether for what seems to be going mainstream these days maybe not universally true but like in Cerulean terms of functional
 I feel like even just in the past five or six months since we started doing software engineering daily the interest in functional programming languages has has been hockey stick why do you think that it's like why is there some pleasurable set of features that functional-programming provides mean I always hear things like a view to bility but is are there any nuances about about functional programming that you would be able to to illuminate given your experience in the field I mean
 nuances what are the things that I consistently hear about people who pick their nose into functional programming is that they whether they end up being able to use it in their job or not
 I just always here that whether it's at sharp or Haskell or whatever it's one of those programming disciplines that changes you and I think that is part of its popularity I think it appeals to a set of people who regardless of what they're working on their just sitting in a in a job working for a bank being told to fix stupid Co-op box I mean
 and I think a lot of functional programming people fit that profile and they find out the tape when I spend a bunch of time in Haskell I became a better job of a programmer even though I don't jealous much things like that I think that's that's part of it
 but the other thing I would say as a kochenour almost it is that my definition of a podcast right now which means by definition we are distinct from Main Street I mean the real notion of mainstream is programmers who don't even get to think about doing functional programming during the day most programming is still done in the most boring predictable languages that the companies can find and so when I you know what I think of mainstream I'm usually thinking of it as stages of mainstream thirst you know there's one stage where people get really interested in it but there's there's a later stage maybe it's three stages later
 Jackal is using functional programming and that's a different state which I find it interesting to think about how does something get to that stage that interesting to think about is that by the time Ford Motor Company is using Technologies as cool as say elixir
 we won't be because it'll be boring by the early adopters are always so far ahead of the of the the mainstream users that sucks I know what I don't know what will be interested in by the time that it's functional programming is boring but it'll be something else that seems like a good place to close off Eric thanks so much for coming out of software engineering daily this is super interesting conversation I appreciate you going back in time to retell a story that I'm sure you told a thousand times but it was very new and fresh to me so I really appreciate it thank you so much

software engineering daily thanks for listening to the toastery Larry welcome to software engineering daily I go to a popular media site on the internet box.com or Huffington Post or some other popular blog or website what are some of the ways that I will be tracked on that website there's a number of different ways that you may be tracked and is we office until our customers and our community is that different trackers two different things are not all created equal. Some of them are there simply to try and make the user experience better so they might be doing a b testing at it provide different experiences for a customer and see which ones they test better provide a better experience others may be around analytics and understanding site visitors and what they're doing with the clicking on where they're headed
others maybe widgets I like real-time comments as an example like a discussion type thread and then others are there to Target ads and then provide ads that are based on your interest your cookie profile so there's a variety of different trackers I get used on websites what you're not around in software engineering but you have a back on the product development from from where you stand what exactly is a tag doing what is a cookie or or there's different things sure they are different things where tracker we use the two words kind of interchangeably it at the ghost story but it's essentially a JavaScript tag there on the page or something it's been inserted into the HTML body of the page and its firing at a certain time as that page loads to do a certain thing I'm so in some cases as I mentioned earlier it's it's firing to to open up you know of a button that allows you to click it and end essay on Facebook that you
like that particular article you just read her or tweet the article link to your Twitter feed so they are JavaScript tags that do that on a page and as I mentioned earlier these are the ones that a lot of people are typically most interested in are the JavaScript tags that are there to communicate with an ad server so that it can serve up an ad that is more tailored towards your interest and in the way that that is determined is usually by looking at something called a cookie or or set of cookies if we refer to a cookie profile that is there on your actual computer your machine and so what happens as you visit different pages cookies get dropped and he's our cookies that you eat either really just little text files that are dropped onto your into a system folder on your computer and they have information about where you where you went when you clicked on I what you did and those cookies can start to help advertisers understand what are the things that you're interested in so if perhaps they see that you've been looking at a lot of travel sites
and I can they confirm that two Deuce that you are looking to go to Hawaii on a vacation is so you might start seeing ads about vacation packages to Hawaii as an example so that's that's one example of how cookies get used to provide targeted ads to you when you go to the websites so cookies are file on my computer where a bunch of text is stored about the places I've visited and the tags on a website are the ways that are the tags on a website allow the website to communicate with that cookie file understand what's going on inside of it perhaps right to it that's correct but the tag on the website is going to be able to communicate information from the cookies back to an ad server and in some cases actually profile you and Enda and so actually start to build a profile of who you are back on the ad server and and that's that's the kind of the ultimate goal of the
fertilizers is because they want to be able to say look based on all all the cooking information that we have we know who this person is we know this is their computer or this is their iPhone if this is their tablets we have an idea of what they like to do with that might even have an idea of some demographics on who you are and that information now starts to get served up some the answer itself so that in this case of jobs are TAG is really just saying hey we know who this person is already and based on knowing that person is what's the best app for me to show them when I am going through a session on this webpage like boxer Huffington Post how much of my behavior is being tracked and share just how much of it are they able to write to the cookie file or gather from my interaction with the website unless you've opted out of that sort of tracking or online be here
behavioral advertising out of his called they can really track whatever they want with regards to how you interact with that website and what you've you know Don what articles you've read what you've looked at and so forth and I could be cross-referenced again against other cookies that are there on on your machine to know other places that you've been so it's not necessarily just what they know about you from what you've done on that site but also other places you've been your browsing history as an example of where you've been on on the internet are they tracking my mouse hovering around or my gyroscope information on mobile on how much information is exposed via the AP eyes that are available to software Developers for apps so forth on that I mean there has been a tendency for those to get more more lockdown but there is quite a bit information that that is available from
mobile devices as an example in this world desktop devices you know what your IP address as an example can tell somebody where you located at from geography standpoint what's going on in the back end of these different tracking companies When I visit page so I go to a page and it's got all these trackers on it they're interfacing with my cookies they're leaving information my cookies they're taking information from my cookies can you give me more of a picture of how information is being shuttled between my browser and these different tracking companies in what who are these tracking companies who are trying to help provide more targeted ads more valuable ads they have a higher success rate of of users actually clicking on them or finding value in them I think we all would agree as users of the in
at that it's annoying when you go somewhere and not only do you see ads that are destructive to your experience but they're not even on point they're not about things that you care about it if you know the holy grail for an Advertiser is to actually have very on-point that's that speak to your interest in your needs and I think we all enjoy that happens and so that's that's the idea around all the technology that is happening behind the scenes it's not necessary it's not about trying to figure out who you are and where you live so that you know they can they can track your movements and send it to the NSA I know what I know there's those conspiracy that are out there but it's really about being able to provide a better click-through rate for for advertisers and that's what helps the ecosystem work that's what keeps content free that's how Publishers make money by providing you know free articles online and exchange for advertisements they show you that they hope that you'll click on because they're relevant to you
and in doing so those advertisers get paid and the publisher continues to pay the bills that that's the theory behind all of it and so you know more directly answer your question there is a lot of information is being shared as you browse had to go to pages and it's all towards a goal of the end of provide more relevant advertising to users there are obviously adtech trackers is he mentioned are there also these information brokerages that maybe I'm not sure how this business work exactly but like they're not exactly I'd tech companies but there's some sort of middle man like just information gatherer tractor companies that may be present on one of these sites I think the level of information of yours they get shared with these different tracking Technologies and companies that are out there is a personal decision and if he ask people feel differently about how much of that information they want
and it can be worrisome you know as an internet user you know I worry sometimes about the information it's being shared with others because there are Bad actors out there we know of security breaches and you no logins I get compromised in that sort of thing and so as a consumer it can be worrisome about how much of my data is on how many different servers out there that I don't know about that I can't control and that's why there are tools in place to to help take control of that and there are you know mechanisms by which you can opt out of online behavioral tracking and advertising and and tip to be able to have more control over that so it is it's one of those things where has a consumer there there is a burden on the consumer to do some research and be informed and educated on this and to exercise the right that you do have an end to it if you're so inclined used tools that allow you to have more control over how your information is shared online absolutely
and whether stools is goes through which we will get into which is a tool for limiting the amount of data that can be gathered by trackers if you want to opt out of a select number of trackers cuz of course there are some trackers that you probably wouldn't ever want to disable there are ones that improve the user experience can you talk about that like what are the examples of when I absolutely need a Tracker have a good user experience example is you know you're on a blog or website where there's a discussion thread and a lot of the discussion or common threads are actually used with JavaScript tags and and yes there is some tracking information there because you know they need to know who you are and that you're not spam bot who was just trying to tell people about this great opportunity we can make $1000000 a year but at the same token if you were to be uncomfortable with that and block that tracker you would be unable then to use that discussion
Fred and and that sort of the quid pro quo so to speak if you want to be able to participate in that Community Forum so to speak you have to be comfortable with some level of information about who you are. Tracker can do its job so to speak so that's one example another example like I said might be the social media buttons that you see in a lot of Articles where you can click a button to share it on your Twitter theater on your Facebook profile with a single button click if these are all examples of trackers that I think most people would agree are are providing a good service out there doing something that makes the experience better for them when they go to that site I think where there's a more polarizing effect is probably again on on some of the cookie profiling and interest based advertising some people find that to be a little creepy others like my wife think it's great she likes it when she sees you know an advertisement for something for you know a pair of shoes she's been looking
foreign and now she sees an app that says they're on sale and and The Advertiser knows that because they know that she's been shopping for their shoes elsewhere so you know it's all in the eye of the beholder as to whether or not that's where the tracking is a service and Anna and a positive thing or it's something that is uncomfortable yeah I mean generally I've seen I've seen some great ads recently that have been maybe I don't think they've that resulted in conversion quite yet but they're getting there I mean I've seen enough soil and dads that are really there really trying to get me to buy Soylent in I'm very tempted at this point
spotted a while ago and I enjoyed it they're trying to give me try it again and I'm tempted how does tracking work within a walled-garden like Facebook or Amazon Dish Dish giant websites that have so much scale and bacon and they all said they have credentials so maybe they don't even need to I mean do they need to track you with cookies and stuff cuz cuz they can just build their own user profile of you still happening it's just it's much more first-party tracking instead of third-party tracking so it's all on Facebook's servers as an example instead of a third-party A technology company server already knows who you are your login they know all about you because you filled out a profile and told them all about you and they know what kind of Articles you're reading on Facebook what sort of interest you have and so forth in and so they can provide very targeted ads and actually a pretty good job of it
I would say most of the ads I see on Facebook are relevant to me and it's because they have so much information about you already and and they're at a great benefit for that I'm it's that sort of Facebook advertising experience that third-party add text are trying to provide when you go to other publisher sites like The Huffington Post or like they were times.com as an example they want to be able to provide as that are as relevant to you as the ones that you see on Facebook but it's a little harder for them to do because when you go to the Huffington Post you don't have a profile that you filled out and said this is who I am you know this is the things that I like these are things I don't like it so they have to try and divine that through cookies that tell him about the things that you look at when you're on the web right and so the the place where information between these different sites is exchanged is often the ad tech company so I go to Huffington Post I browse around and do some stuff and an ad
company checks that Atlantic County register's that I have visited Huffington Post and then I go in and I'm looking at some news article about Spain and then I'm on YouTube and I start seeing some featured videos about Spain trying to get me to go take a vacation to Spain and the reason that YouTube knows that is because Google has plugged into that attic YouTube has plugged into that advertising exchange and has registered that I have gone to Huffington Post and looked at an article about Spain you got it exactly right that's how it works okay is the browser maker able to track me like a Google Chrome just get even more information and more thorough information and give that to Google and they can build it an even more fine-grained profile about me or are there limitations to what
project can track anything it wanted to because it it's loading all the pages I don't know that most of the browsers do that Google obviously makes Chrome but I don't believe to my knowledge at least that they're they're trying to profile people at the browser level there they're doing in Atmore through the search results things you searched on Google as well as you know their own tags they have for their very sad technology entities can you characterize the different players in the ad Tech business in more detail I know that's a big question but there are these at exchanges that are exchanging information about us there helping ads track Target more specifically there's Google and Facebook that are also in some sense ad exchanges but they're doing slightly different roles than the than the Justice play
advertising exchanges like open axon and what's the big one app Nexus there's also dsps I think was that demand-side providers I platform platform there's Publishers which is like The Huffington Post us these are sites that actually published ads and they publish content that make the ads attractive to post their that's right I know this because she can you can you can you characterize this Marketplace in a little more detail cuz it's not like a it's not like a straightforward two-sided Market Place like we used to in economics there's a lot of different pieces in components in and frankly a lot of the lines are emerging for a lot of these companies is day as they start to provide you know entry is it in the different product categories so to speak at a high level you have your demand side and your supply size who demand-side platform for dsps are exactly like you said those are the likes of you know your media manager
Nexus and so forth and then they're the ones that are really working with the brand that want to advertise so they're the ones that are providing dumb and for ads and then the other supply-side which is you know you're double click for Publishers which is the Google entity PubMatic Rubicon so for if they're working more with the Publishers that are supplying advertising space and so the idea there is that if your publisher you use an SSP to say look I have so much add space that I can feel without inventory on my on my site and if you're a brand who is or an ad agency who is the most cases representing a brand it was trying to place ads your DSP is helping you to sell that inventory to the various Publishers who are providing the supply and so
that all gets a brokered and done on what are taught at exchanges Witcher essentially where Publishers who want to sell ad space can be coupled with Branson and ad agencies who want to sell advertisement and a match could be made so to speak and all of that it happens you know in near real-time when you go to a website based again on who you are so that in real time the Right add can be shown to you is that you have 10 different people can go to the same page and see 10 different ads and it's because of all its DSP SSP technology that's happening behind the scenes and in a matter of milliseconds which is pretty impressive stuff in any add servers are out there and those are the things that sir about the ad so the publisher site itself is not what has the atom in Torrey that add inventory sits on the ad creative says they called him sit on the ad servers
are served up to the publisher when that JavaScript tag fires and says give me the right ad for this particular user so those are some of the name players like I said I'm at as you know as these companies start to either acquire other smaller players or they start to me know who make their product portfolio larger so they can be sort of a once One Stop Shop so is all of the steps that need to occur for an advertising auction to take place is kind of astounding so I go to a web page and the page is deciding which add to show me and in the fraction of a second the publisher is connected to the supply-side platform which somehow links up with the demand-side platform and figures out which ad from which agency which is representing which Advertiser to serve to me and all of that is done before my page loads
how do the orchestra me I understand you're not an engineer but how the heck is that orchestrated so that it's not some crazy amount of latency yeah that's one of the things that that we're not doing a good job at as far as providing a good experiment the industry as a whole and so yes and that that's one of the reasons that people are using tools like go straight to say look you're not doing a good job at a serving of these ads in a timely manner and there's so much stuff happening at the page loads slowly but there are there are techniques for for how this gets done that that you can kind of have your cake and eat it too and of course the attic providers are are continuing to fine-tune you know their technology provide bigger and bigger throw more Hardware at it so forth but yes there's a there's a wrong way and it right way to do it and if it's done the wrong way you do Stefan
see some some poor latency I think we've all been to those pages before that take a long time to load because there's so much stuff happening behind the scenes yeah that's the thing is what's what I find so funny about this whole ad blocker stuff is people use ad blockers because it degrades please add the grade that user experience in their current form and that's why the sites like Forbes are suffering so much is that a silly because people don't want to see add people generally don't want to see ads but sometimes they don't sometimes you just neutral cuz whatever it is that is kind of helpful it's not really in the way I don't really care but show me the sights just have a bad experiences that just ruin the reading experience and it's clear that the reading experience is there to serve the advertising experience rather than the other one other way around
so what are you explain how go straight work so people yeah people now to head out of a good picture of the advertising landscape the all these trackers that are going on explain what ghostery does sure so so gross tree first and foremost it is a tool to make the internet better to make what experience is better for both consumers as well as site owners so we're probably most well-known for our consumer browser extension you know we have 10 million some active users around the globe use ghostery to control how their data is shared online so its force of its first and foremost a privacy tool and by default when you install ghostery nothing's blocked but you can make decisions on a site-by-site basis or on a tracker by tracker basis if you want to get into the you know granularities of it as to which ones you're comfortable with and which ones you're not and and our users are pretty informed we would provide a lot of information about you should have
curse so when you go to page you can see which trackers are loading you can click on any one of them to read about the company who they are using your data where it's going and you can make informed decisions as to whether or not you trust that company having your information or not or like I said you can make them or blanket decision and say which sites you're comfortable with sharing your information which ones are not and I will just look most of our users tend to do that that's what ghostery does and it it's real goal is to first and foremost being education tool and empowerment tool for consumers to understand how their day to get to using to go to websites and then secondary light to be able to make decisions that off that information as to what they're comfortable with and what they're not and that's a very personal decision for each other users that we don't make for them we let our users make that decision for themselves and that and that's really been a core goal and value of a ghost resend the very beginning is we're not taking sides we're not telling you what's good and what's bad we're just providing you information and letting you make those decisions for yourself
business side of the equation ghostery also provides tools for Brands inside owners to both be compliant with privacy laws as well as to provide analytics into how the use of Easter party Technologies on your website can degrade the user experience and actually work against what you're trying to do with the site owner because at the end of the day sight owners don't create websites to aggravate users that that would not be a very good business model but they sometimes inadvertently do exactly that because they don't have good oversight on the use of these trackers on their website and they don't understand how it's degrading user experience how it's perhaps compromising privacy and security for the users or in some cases perhaps you know actually selling the information that they have about their users to a competitor these are the things that the that the Enterprise tools that goes to rebuild help provide site owners and give them the
please provide a better user experience for their consumer so we feel like a ghost we were really attacking the problem from both ends of the equation of both from the consumer standpoint I've given them tools to to be in power and control the user experience as well as on the Enterprise side giving sight owners tools to be able to take more responsibility and be more proactive and they will experience their provider users

 I like ghosts real odd because when I look at the company I see incentive structure that makes a lot of sense and is not really a predatory on anyone but in contrast there a lot of companies and I kind of want to get into this there are companies that whether or not they're engaged in malfeasance on purpose they are engaged in a bad behavior or they're involved in in touch of bad behavior that make them money perhaps indirectly sometimes it is the ad tech industry has evolved to be a place where incentives are often not to do the right thing it's almost like a like the banking business you think that's accurate well I think there are some bad actors out there as I said earlier and you know we definitely see
 call letter that are have business models that that goes through we just don't feel good about it so that you know we don't participate in and into your point yeah we we do try very hard at Echo Street have a business model which we feel is acceptable to everybody where we're not trying to take sides we're not trying to kill the ecosystem we're actually trying to make the ecosystem better and we have this bottle it's very transparent and and there are some players out there who are not as transferring with their business model and and you know maybe claim to be in service of the consumer but in reality they're they're not and and that's that's something that we feel strongly a ghost story about making sure that were very transparent and upfront about how we do business and and how we make money let's talk about that what are some of the ways that the advertising business the online tracking business what are some of the ways that they undercut the best Inn
 of the consumer where the end-user or perhaps The Advertiser the company is trying to spread their brand online through advertising what are the way that this ecosystem with all these middleman dsps SPS ad tech companies tracking companies what are some of the ways that the end-user The Advertiser get milked what is one of those, thanks for seeing out there right now is is at fraud and what that essentially is is some Bad actors that are that are creating a technology to essentially mimic real users going to sites and seeing ads because the world is all about Impressions which is how many thousands of people have seen this ad and that's how are Publishers get paid and that's what advertisers are paying for is the number of Impressions that has been able to make it so as you might imagine in the case of add fraud where impressions are being counted not for actual
 letting breeding humans that's all the ad but for some sort of a bot or program that's been created to mimic users you know loading up web pages well that doesn't really serve anybody that that ends up causing Publishers to to essentially overstate the numbers of the people that were seeing those ads and advertisers and I paying for Impressions they never got and and no one really is is a Serve by that because now that you go system is has fraud in it and again it's the same ecosystem that keeps content free for for all of us users that that want to be able to continue to have a free internet and deed so the sum of the problematic situation to are a publisher like a Blog that has ads on it may pay some sketchy service somewhere for traffic quote on quote
 an increase in traffic and they don't know where that increase the traffic is coming from but the increase of traffic comes chances are it is from Bots somewhere and those Bots end up seeing advertisements and then in some circumstances you can have if you could even have a horrible situation where perhaps there's an ad tech company somewhere the company is selling ads to certain sites and then it turns out all the ad tech companies selling ads two sites that they own and they're also buying bot traffic on those sites there's a lot of problematic situations that could develop and at the corner of it is the question can we differentiate bought traffic from Human traffic
 oh there's there's technology I think it does it now Google is probably one of the the largest not the larger largest to investor and in that technology cuz of course they they gained a benefit by being able to ask you no fair down stamp out at fraud it so yeah there's a lot of technology is being employed at developed everyday to to solve the problem of that fraud it's a bit of a cat and mouse game and but I think the technology will continue to to advance and hopefully it's something that that if doesn't if it doesn't you completely obliterated at least gets brought in to check overtime how transparent is Google about how good they are catching fraudsters I'm probably not the right person to answer that question I mean there's a number of articles that that talk about this you know Google's is of course you know you very much in the Attic business that's that's there
 main source of income in so I would imagine it that the vet it's something that they're working very hard to make better and where there are issues they may not want to be is forthright with how bad the issues are but it's it's it's no secret everyone knows it that's rotted out there any time you go to you know an ad Tech conference it's one of the key things that people are talking about it's it's an industry-wide concern and like I said there are a lot of a lot of smart people that are working on it and and Google in many cases is leading that charge do the brands that are advertising into this ecosystem like Procter Gamble or craft do they know how much farther is an ecosystem why I think like many of us there they're trying to make that decision based off of the information that they have and it's not always a perfect system with
 measurement I just saw an article the other day where I think you mentioned Procter & Gamble themselves were disappointed to find that the other day at Impressions that they were they were getting on Facebook we're not as good as advertised on this is a case of that fraud but it's just a matter of adding correct measurement to buy Facebook of how effective their ads were Bean with regards to showing relevant advertising to their users and so one of the great Promises of a Facebook and some of these you know first party platforms is that they can provide very relevant ads that that have higher success rates and of course that's why a lot of brands have been flocking to to the whites of Facebook and others to to advertise but of course you know when when the accuracy of those measurements is called into question that can give you know Brands reason to pause Andrea and rethink that strategy and and
 question whether or not they're they're getting a value for their bucket they were told they were so there is a there is a lack I think a general lack of understanding the visibility around a lot of the the measurements around the effectiveness of ads and it's another one of those areas where the the industry in the ecosystem is trying to get better because at the end of the day people don't want to pay for what they're not getting and I think I think anyone would feel that way that event where Facebook recently disclosed that they had been measuring views on videos in an incorrect way that was that was pretty worrisome they just closed it that their numbers on the numbers they publicized about how many views videos on Facebook we're getting were off and they were correcting them you know it was nice to see a disclosure it's always nice to see it disclosure but
 got it it's it worries me about the ecosystem that these numbers are hard to get right even on the even on the first party platforms because you think about how much how much how many layers there are two getting this tracking right and and you know I don't even on Facebook in a walled-garden where they have really good ways of detecting if you're a human or not they still have hundreds of must be hundreds of millions of fake profiles and you know it's just hard to get clean traffic it's hard to get clean numbers even if you can identify the clean traffic but the ecosystem takes on more money gets spent every year on digital advertising and and that's because companies believe it is working companies typically don't throw money at things that are not providing results and so you know despite all the warts and so forth the attic ecosystem can't in
 to provide value to its customers and and I think the problems continue to be worked on and you know it I guess I'm an optimist but I believe in technology and I believe technology can solve all problems and I think it gets better all the time now in the 2008 crisis we saw that Humanity has the potential to dramatically misprice things as a crowd as a big crowd the advertising ecosystem is obviously much bigger in scale than the securitized mortgage industry but it does make you wonder you know clearly we had this massive herd mentality of mispricing in a situation where people were kind of just copying each other in ecosystem is there any chance that we're doing that with online advertising or perhaps these ads that were purchasing are just not worth
 and they're dramatically overpriced and the fraud is not getting priced and effectively is there any chance of that there is a chance of that and I think that's why we're seeing some of the evolving nature of of the attic industry over the years to to help hedge against that concern and I think the other thing we're seeing happen is a lot of the actors in consolidation in the attic space so there's there's several larger companies that are emerging smaller companies that are getting rolled up into larger companies and that's it happens I think we're seeing more of the inefficiency he's worked out of the system and then seeing it work better and at a you know a higher profit margin so to speak for all their involve so but yes I think you ask a question it's it's one that many people probably much smarter and more informed than I have I am I have had speculated on and there's people on both sides of the issue I guess what I look at
 personally is a fact that like I said digital advertising continues to grow year-over-year and I think this is technically yeah generally don't spend money on things that they don't feel like our are being working for them yeah it's just with the reason I brought up the 2008 crisis is we had many years of people buying securitized that is true that is true okay Facebook and Google do they have incentive to police fraud as much as I possibly can or are there incentives more aligned with yeah you know will police enough to be convincing or is that too conspiratorial again these guys are very and sent it to to make sure that that the distance they're running is as unblemished as possible and so I have
 say that they are doing everything they can to do exactly that and then to you know get that stuff under control yeah I mean I certainly hope so and look I am as much as much a fan of Facebook in Google as you possibly could be I think but you know it's just like you see this absolute power corrupts absolutely certainly in the in the banking industry time and time again and end home an online advertising industry Sears even more opaque and even harder to police than the banking industry again I think that's where we see the technology getting better all the time too to help make that it more transparent because yeah advertisers Publishers everyone who's part of this wants to have transparency and consumers do as well you know go straight again we we attack the transparency from the consumer side from the site on her side but there are a lot of you know add text
 companies out there that are that are trying to buy more transparency for advertisers and Publishers as well did you see the the other story about The Guardian purchasing its own traffic and finding the just like the the middleman in between them purchasing their own traffic on their site so basically they purchased ads on their own site like they pretended that they were the guardian is a publisher they purchased traffic on their site as if they were an Advertiser like as if they were Procter & Gamble and they found that something like $40 of their $100 in advertising spend actually translated to two pads being paid for on their website do you see that article I didn't know it was interesting yeah it was quite interesting so do you think do you think it's time goes on like the these layers of middlemen work it will get cut so I guess that's what you're saying you're saying that they'll get consolidated
 he'll get more efficient they will be more dollar spent where they should be yeah there's more the data is sitting with no one company vs. it being piece together from from 10 different Technologies and so some of those in efficiencies get worked out and and as you work at and efficiencies for she can improve the value for per dollar by the same token it's kind of funny cuz we see consolidation but then we also continue to see a number of new technologies Morse on the marketing side that it better springing up all the time I'm so yeah we're seeing some consolidation the attic side but we're actually in a lot of sprawl on the marketing text side which is a different topic obviously than adtech but it's it's one that is of Interest it and it to go street again because on the Enterprise side we provide tools that allow side owners to to be
 go to take inventory of all the different third-party technology was on their site which is much more than just add technology we talked a lot about a technology that gets a lot of the coverage it's where the sexy topic that that you know all of the publication's want to talk about but the marketing technology it is also something that that's a big piece of the puzzle with regards to what experience does that mean sure yeah I mean there's a lot of stuff out there that's all your analytics there is here you know your your various tools that people use your your dmps or your TMS is at these are all tools that marketers are using in the same way that that advertisers try to profile people in an end and provide your dad's but if you're a marketer it's more about providing you know a funnel of leads for your sales people and so they're using a lot of similar technology
 time to be able to provide better more Target experiences for their site visitors and to be able to fill that funnel with qualified leads that they can they can go in and do business with it so advertising is one aspect of that but it's not the only aspect and and it's it's off to time to see like I said the ad Tech world gets a lot of publication a lot of lot of publicity but the marketing technology out there just like a technology if left unchecked can can really start to decorate the degrade rather than the experience of your site sisters yeah and you know what I think is interesting about this whole ecosystem and this gets back to tracking more generally is that she dating website like Huffington Post or New York Times and these websites don't feel very personalized the advertisement certainly feel personalized but when I go to the New York Times.
 I still see just like front page of a bunch of articles that I don't care about and yet the ads are so targeted towards me why can't the New York Times integrate all this you know if I'm going to be tracked through out the internet like why can't it just provide me utility on the content why does it have to just provide the utility on the ads sure sure I think we see some of that happening I mean there are there are tools out there news aggregators and so forth that that are intended to provide you content that is pertinent to your interest and so forth and I personally believe that's where a lot of the online publication and she's going to go that's been Works rated news based on my taste in my interest which you know we will probably be great for advertisers cuz it will make it that much easier to provide targeted ads when when you can provide Target content okay so very interesting stuff we should talk a little bit more about ghost story we've been
 you've been treating me to a tour and inside tour of the ad tech industry tell me more about ghostery how practical it works there and how you are seeing businesses using ghostery so gross Street product development works and service of our of our customers we want to provide value to them and as I mentioned we have both business customers as well as consumer customers consumer side we work very closely with many of our users to get their feedback on what enhancements and teachers they want to see added to the goes through browser extension I haven't mentioned it we also have a grocery mobile browser on both IOS and Android that allows consumers to to use the same sort of features and options that they have in it in the browser extension on their desktop browsers they can they can use that in a mobile browser as well we were closer with our community we we listen to
 can we do a lot of user testing a lot of feedback and surveying to make sure that we're building the kind of product that are that are users are going to love and want to use and and rally around and I think if you look at ghostery on social media and you'll see that our users are big fans they like what we do they trust us we work hard to earn that trust and to keep it between me and I like I said very transparent with what we do and how we do it and then we try to do that same thing on on the business side as well for Enterprise Products so we we have a number of large Fortune 500 type clients that we work closely with to bring them tools that that allow them to provide a better with experience for their customers so it particular problem referring to Scott MCM which is short for marketing Cloud management and it's all about an empowering site owners were they work on the marketing side of the house or the it side of the house to be able to take
 Victoria third-party Technologies of it on their sites whether it's a technology of marketing technology year or any sort of Gino third-party JavaScript tags at that are deployed on their site are tools allow them to take inventory of what's in there and understand what it's doing it should it be there or not how is it affecting site performance how is it affecting user privacy how how is it is it essentially is it serving a good purpose or a bad purpose on my website and it's a bad purpose you know let me get rid of it and so I actually came about as a result of many of the site owners who are using the ghost your browser extension to basically you know test their own site just so you know what what's on my outside cuz I don't actually know and asking can you give me an Enterprise tool that is essentially a grocery Grocery browser extension but for me to use my own website so that I can be a more responsible side owner and provide a better with experience tonight for my visitors
 because ghostery is part of this trend towards tools that make improving website performance easier even if you're not a developer should I'm sure a lot of these Fortune 500 companies developers but perhaps the person who is in charge of front-facing websites tracking I don't know may not have a lot of development experience but anyway I think you you gave a better overview that I can Larry thanks for coming to show is there anything else you'd like to add about ghost tree just that if you want to learn more you can afford to visit our website to go street.com or follow us on on Twitter or Facebook and it was great to be here today and I hope that your listeners have learned a little bit about how the ecosystem works and would encourage you to to go download the ghost Rick Ross

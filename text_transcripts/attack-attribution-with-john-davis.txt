Transcription: when a Cyber attack occurs how do we identify who committed it there's no straightforward answer to that question even if we know Chinese hackers have infiltrated our power grid with logic bombs we might not be able to say with certainty whether those hackers were state actors or Rogue Chinese hackers looking for an offensive asset that they can sell to their government even if we know someone in Russia launched an attack on the banking system in Ukraine we might not know whether that attack came from the government of Russia or from aggressive non-governmental forces that are aligning themselves with the government accurate cyber-attack attribution is key to preventing diplomatic mistakes in the modern battleground of the internet today's guest John Davis is one of the authors of the report called stateless attribution to Ward's International accountability in cyberspace
John is a senior information scientist with Rand Corporation a non-profit institution that helps improve policy and decision-making through research and Analysis this report was commissioned by Microsoft and it provides a deep assessment of our current ability to attribute a cyber-attack to the perpetrator of that attack we're trying out something new with the software engineering daily question of the week this week we want to know what is the best continuous delivery or continuous integration tool open source tool or platform some software-as-a-service that you use we want to know what is the best continuous delivery to lend why are using it send me an email Jeff at software engineering daily.

 John Davis is a senior information scientist with Rand Corporation John welcome to software engineer daily thank you so much it's not going to be here to talk to you I reached out because you have written about attribution and attack attribution is a topic that I have been following for several years I haven't gone deep on it but I'm hoping we can do that in this episode and I think this is a topic is only going to increase in importance for people who are unfamiliar with the term attribution what does that mean we're really when you talk about cyber attribution the whole goal is to determine who is the responsible party associated with a given cyberattack and you can think about that in a couple of ways first of all you can identify the computer system through which an attack occurred you can also ideally
 try to also identify the persons that engaged with computer systems and networks to facilitate the attack and then the third type of attribution really looks at who are the parties that may not necessarily touch the computer keyboards but certainly were responsible and perhaps provided the funding resources necessary to facilitate the attack in this this would be disturbed category as where States may come into play
 when a physical attack occurs if I punch somebody that is a pretty easy conflict to understand that you're bution I am responsible for the punch the victim is the person who I have punched why is it so much more complicated in cyber attacks
 well in fundamental that you're dealing with a complex topic when you think about the technology that sits behind the internet the vast majority of people are not familiar with that who are not technologist so just talking about the kinds of communications that goes on underlined enter internet is a complex topic the Internet by its very design has a very Dynamic design to it where I should say the internet was designed in a very Dynamic way so that there is not a single point of failure it has a very distributed nature that there is the addresses the IP addressing scheme is constantly changing so what might be the case or what the network that you would be dealing with during the course of an attack versus the network that you'd be dealing with days weeks months later maybe very different and then the other issue is that you just don't have this
 physical evidence that everyone can see when you're dealing with cybersecurity it's just does not have the display that would occur in a kinetic attack and so for those kinds of reasons it's very much difficult process to to engage in that's not to say that there are not techniques that have become more commonly used. Make it a lot easier to identify who the source of an attack or the responsible party associated with attack is but it still does have a nature that is you know they're there no guarantees when you compare it to other types of attacks who is responsible for attributing an attached to the attacker is it a government is it the corporations that may be the victims of an attack
 well I mean there's certainly is no law that is set up to require a particular party be responsible for engaging in this after bution activity off the victim it has the strongest incentive to determine who the attacker is and in some cases defect them will use their own resources if they do have such capabilities in other cases the victim will hire third-party firms to provide security services in various attributes and services to act on their behalf so in that former case certainly when you look at countries like the United States that have tremendous capability to engage inside retribution leveraging their intelligence Community then they're able to perform some of this investigation on their own their other countries that do have equivalent to kill sets but there are a whole lot of countries that don't have the skill set
 there's been evidence that China does not have strong skills in performing attribution even though they engage in any of them certainly has been quite a bit of evidence of the attacks they have perpetrated if you think about the this other category of victim often victims who are perhaps commercial entities commercial Farms they will set up an arrangement with a private cyber security firm and that will lead to an investigation and then that firm will operate power that firm does decide to operate now one of the things that, though various firms such as you know you're at your crowdstrike your fire eyes they do often share information and kind of have some degree of sharing of practices among them but at the end of the day there's no overarching policy for how any of these
 castigated vanities should operate that China may not be great at attribution it's not hard to imagine a scenario where that's actually quite problematic because especially cuz you said that they have they do have some off fensive intent or off baby they have gone through offense of actions if you can imagine a scenario where China engages in an offense of scenario and then China has an attack that goes what's a trying to engage an offense of scenario towards the United States and then China is the victim of an attack if China is not great at the actual Act of attribution there could be a third party that pretends to be the United States and attacks China and makes it look like it was the United States and this creates a situation where there is mass confusion how realistic is that type of scenario I've laid out of this something that I should be concerned about
 that's a very real scenario not necessarily having a curd with China per se but that kind of scenario where we have these false Flags has occurred in the past and we do have this concerned that the perpetrator might intentionally leave tracks which would suggest that the attacker is a different entity and that can throw the investigators off the trail particularly if those investigators do not have a strong attribution skillset so for example tv5monde a media Outlet in France the attacker engaged and false flag activities to suggest that it was Isis who engaged in the attack when in fact it turned out not to be Isis and much of the evidence points at apt28 which is associated with Russia so that's certainly a possibility and to the extent that
 some of the parties involved do not have solid skills and being able to do this investigation therein lies an opportunity to have a gold standard investigation which Mike the silicate avoiding finger pointing in the wrong direction what are some of the technical methods that cyber attackers use to misdirect the people who are trying to track them down and perform correct attribution
 beautiful kind of group the evidence into three categories you have the technical evidence you have the evidence that is generally associated with the intelligence community and then you have evidence or really motivations that often tend to be tied to politics if we think about this technical evidence a lot of this is the various files types of vulnerability software vulnerabilities now where various other loaf of file types that you'll find in the attack system the use of computers with particular addresses think that this sort and
 in some cases the characteristics of this evidence can be used as a way to indicate a particular type of an attacker so often the infrastructure that is using these attacks is fairly complex I mean there's a range of complex beat let's be clear so there are some cases where there's a ton of low-hanging fruit attacks but there are some attacks that require fairly complex technology the use of you know various types of vulnerabilities and the entity that uses or for first develops and then uses that technology when they want to set up a subsequent attack against a different and it a different victim
 it's often the case that they want to reuse that same infrastructure because it's pretty heavy left to put all this infrastructure in play so what can happen is over time you'll see these patterns where the same kind of evidence of showing up so you know a particular entity will frequently use a particular type of vulnerability or they're always exploit you know Powershell or in fact what's common in the industry is to consider them our family so you have these various names of malware that are used across several attack incidents and a given Maurer family will indicate a certain type of characteristic associated with the the attack so that's one of the ways that you can find evidence from a technical standpoint

 and I remember reading I think of this is a book by Eric Schmidt and somebody else if it back in 2013 or so they were talking about the difficulties of attribution and one difficulty is that it can be a particular place like China where the line between corporate and government are far specially blurred it could be running hard to identify if a cyberattack is is perpetrated by a state actor or if it's perfect day by a rogue Corporation or just like some group of hackers that are looking for money and it's you know it certainly also he had the case in in Russia you know people talk about what's going on in Russia like whether or not Putin orchestrated some sort of attack on the electoral system of the United States it's quite possible that his underling
 who were just who are kind of like jockeying for for power within the Kremlin they might have carried out under their own autonomy some sort of cyber effort whether not orchestrated by the government so it can be hard to say like even if you know an attack comes from a region did actually come from from a government or or a state actor is that part of the attribution process that you consider are you more just considering like how'd you know what computer did this attack come from
 Walt the focus of our paper did include that component as well again we were considering it from these three different perspectives but that is a valid point that there is a challenge it's much harder to be able to directly at a government entity versus being able to point just to the the computer from which the attack with lunch and this is one of the places where intelligence can come to play and be very useful also a particular intelligence agencies may have access to a human intelligence where they were able to talk to someone associated with the adversarial government and be able to get the right information knowing that the government was intent on engaging in this attack another possibility is that there is some signals intelligence where they were able to eavesdrop on communication lines or intercept internet traffic that showed communication and props at Direct
 that was made by a pickle government to indicate that the government was supporting the attack so those are the kind of things that can help facilitate this understanding and support the investigation but again one of the things to keep in mind is in some cases you may or may not have access to this kind of intelligence and other cases the intelligence that you have access to may not necessarily be that robust and so there will always be some level of almost the probabilistic nature to this and often when the agency or investigative Authority comes out with a decision they may associated with it a degree of certainty we even see this in the Russian attack on the US presidential election 2016 we're not all intelligence agencies have the same level of confidence based on the information that they were
 had it at their disposal they were not all at the same level of confidence and this and this it kind of is an example of where the intelligence that you have to support the evidence that you do have direct access to can impact your decision I would love to hear you talk more about that because you know somebody is studied in depth and maybe you could just disambiguate the most common places of public confusion around the topic of Russian hacking in the 2016 election
 right so I think part of the challenge when we think about the Russian hacking scenario is that there were these strong political aspects that lead to lots of dissension about the decision even within the United States and I think this communication aspect of the particular attack or are the this communication aspect of the particular investigative decision is a really important aspect that we felt was was keep your address again if you think about the technical political and intelligence nature of these investigations one of the challenges is right now there is no consistent way to communicate the particular investigation decision and this is both from the standpoint of the
 level certainty that might be associated with the decision from the standpoint of the way the report will be presented having a standardized report would be useful in and of itself in a way that could kind of break down the contents of the decision recognizing that some people will need to know the technical details but they're going to be other people that won't necessarily have that skill set and won't be able to understand it and then in in many cases the way these are communicated currently is a lot of the material is declare classified so what this means is that the public and that Pollock include being very important Hill often very important decision-makers won't necessarily be able to discuss in a public way what the content of the report consist of you know
 material be redacted in the various reports and so now when you lay on top of that the various political motivations and incentives at the end of the day it led to an easy opportunity to dispute these various decisions so even though the intelligence Community largely agreed that the Russians are only engaged and information operation campaign against the presidential election because of the way this information was communicated it still left enough room for dissension arguments of it of dissension and the part of the problem it was hard for me
 is I look at for example what what we know happened which is that there was a broad marketing campaign of around to spreading a fake information or dubious information or basically the digital equivalent of attack ads against Hillary Hillary Clinton or pro pro drum pads and you know you could consider that hacking like you kind of could in a certain light except it's it's not really acting its marketing so you know what is the Russian government's put $18 into Facebook ads that were targeted at rural Americans that were on the fence is that hacking do the intelligence Brokers within the government consider that hacking I don't know and if they consider that hacking than that that would honestly make me a lot less concerned
 makes me concerned but it would make me less concerned about like the efficacy of our voting systems for example I'm not sure if you are one of the people who is privy to two more information that we have to I mean whatsoever you okay and then we talk about the technical disclosures what we have seen technically I mean I just remember seeing something that was like I think this is a Grizzly steppe report you and I talked about this on the phone the grizzly steppe report I think is the most technical piece of information about the hacking that has been released and it was kind of a a no like it was nothing there was nothing but that made me a little concerned about like okay well what what is the truth here what's getting politicized what is factual right I mean so I think a couple things the first of all. Just go back to this information campaign and you know they eat the berries ads on on Facebook or whatever so at a certain level this is It's kind of new territory and just recognizing how there is this
 two largest at personalized access to so many members of society right it's not just that you know article shows up wrong in the newspaper but yeah when I log into Facebook versus you versus someone else we may be seeing different stories that could influence our decisions when it comes to the election and so that's all you know of a radical concept and it will continue to be more and more personalized so that's largely new territory quickly with respect to thinking about elections to get back to the report and some of this information being one of that you point I made of being standardized so again even if we look at the kinds of research that does happen in the kinds of reports that are produced there is a great deal of fragmentation that occurs among
 the various entities that will be producing these reports in and that includes both these private sector cyber security firms as well as the various intelligence agencies so for example one of the things I mentioned earlier how you have these advanced persistent threats apts and these apts are often given names that represent a particular set of evidence associated with a given attack so in some cases you have firms that use kind of an apt numbering scheme in other cases you have firms that use some in the case of for example crowdstrike they use kind of animal names associated with their apts and so the challenge here is were already dealing with a complex topic but each of these firms often are using different names refer to the same set of evidence
 and this just adds a degree of complexity particularly when you're dealing with people that need to understand this but don't come from a technical background so those are some of the kind of issues that we believe there is room for improvement so that as we move forward and as you said and I totally agree with you this is going to continue to be an issue we are we're at the beginning of that semi cyber attacks have been happening for four decades now let's be clear this didn't just start in 2016 but never the less I see this occurring more and more as we continue to digitize are our lives and so having a way to just thinking about how this is being communicated to the public because you're right the great Grizzly stat report there was a lot of criticism about it so thinking about the communication approach of these reports that's an important thing to consider
 and so that would be one of the outcomes that we believe would be a valuable and the kind of organization we proposed exactly and you are talking about the report you wrote called stateless attribution toward International accountability in cyberspace this is a fascinating concept I think it's an important concept for our time it's it's this is like as big of a deal as a nuclear non-proliferation because you know the people who are in power across the world they've got to know that you know were moving towards a place where there could just be such chaos in the information Street and see if if if we go off the rails you know you could see complete Bedlam happening I mean you think about the other side of the coin of the women's March like how like that was basically are Arab Spring right like digital in for digital information was brought people into the street
 on a scale we've never seen thank God it was a peaceful protest but if you think about a corrupted information flow that brings people out of the streets in Mutiny especially on the backs of false information it could be complete chaos so you got to think that the people in power game theory why is there thinking okay this we do want to lay out some rules for this game we do want to weigh to do true attribution International accountability so why don't you describe the process of writing the report
 right so you know just just a tack on to what you just said you talked about how it's this information is corrupted this can cause these tremendous problems and I think the one other thing I would add to that is if it's not only information that is being consumed by humans but more more this information will be consumed by various devices that will then actuate there is machines on behalf of us right and so that can lead to even bigger problem so yeah and example I mean you know I don't mean to you to make this sound to dystopic but even if it's just information that directs our autonomous Lyft and Uber to drive to the wrong address consistently so that no one is able to get picked up for rides or he delivered to the right location those are the kind of things that may become possible as this information is is corrupted more more to your York
 question so
 we were approached by Microsoft they were interested I've they have recently been doing quite a bit of work thinking about the cyber attacks and in particular they proposed this notion of a digital Geneva Convention that was really just a metaphor recognizing that this has to be taken very seriously in the way that we take very seriously some of the activities associated with Kinetic Warfare so they approached us and said can you help us think through what a global organization that's tasked with cyber attribution responsibilities how would that work in ization look and so the idea would be there a given Cyber attack this organization could be called upon to engage and the investigation and then they would render a decision about the attack gave us that high-level description and then at that point we just went off and
 did are thinking about it and so there are a couple things that we recognize were important first of all we reviewed many of the attacks that have occurred over the past several years we look at the various players that were involved as I mentioned for their these private cyber security firms that are often involved and then of course there are these intelligent agencies that are involved we look at the fact that often these attacks shouldn't be studied in isolation because an attack is often part of an ongoing campaign and you really need to look at the characteristics of a set of attack events that are related and are associated with a particular perpetrator and end this this is typically how it's done as I suggested with see the current cyber security research Community we also recognized that there is this political nature to these attacks and
 United States is has been a perfect example of how politicizing can come into play with respect to these decisions so one of the key ideas that we suggest it though was that this organization to not have States as its members so we shouldn't think of this as being a direct analogy to the United Nations for example where you know the US Russia Canada China you know all other states are members of the the berries of the body instead of thinking was that it makes more sense to make this independent of particular nation states and make membership consists of cyber Security Experts that come from essentially two places we need to have cyber Security Experts that do know the technical ins-and-outs of how cyber security attacks occurred
 these are people that have been involved in and investigations maybe they have worked at a across Tricor Kaspersky or or in a previous life have worked at NSA and know the technical details of how to attribute an attack and then secondly we need a set of researchers that may not know the technical details but know about international law they know political motivations and can think about some of these little inside Sarah sociated with cybersecurity attack at a certain level we borrowed this from the way the Talon manual was put together or the manual had a group of experts that essentially assess international law with respect and cybersecurity their goal was to think how can international law as it currently exist
 how should it be interpreted with respect to cybersecurity and they pulled forth a distinguished set of experts led by Michael Schmidt who the law professor and use that to write up at this point to manual the first manual and then II manual just came out early this year tell Emmanuel to point out so I thinking is that we want to have both of these kinds of experts associated with this organization but these experts would not be official representatives of a particular nation and we thought that that might serve as a way to avoid some of the politicization that would certainly come about once a decision is made now to be clear we recognize that while you may not be an official representation of a given Nation just based on your birth place and where you live and where you associate obviously they're going to be some connections so there would have to be due diligence to
 ensure that there is Broad representation we don't want this to just be us Centric we want to have a broad set of Representatives and that includes both representative in the wealthier industrialized nations as well as Representatives that are not necessarily from those wealthy industrialized nations in fact for example there is a big attack in Bangladesh that led to the theft of a significant amount of money I believe it was 80 million dollars although I don't have that number right in front of me and in this case you're talking about a country that does not have the sophistication of the US or of Israel there certain not able to do a decisive cybersecurity attribution investigation but we still want to have them representative because it's likely the case that will continue to have a tax ID
 packed those kind of countries as well as the wealthier countries and an organization like this should be able to represent that kind of perspective

 when you completed this report did you just submit it to Microsoft or did you submit it to a group of people while I'm curious what the response was as is typically the case with ran reports we publish status on our website so all of our reports are made public there are few exceptional cases where a report might be classified if it's done would be half of the Department of Defense for example but in this case it was made public it's available if you go to ran. Org and do a search on stateless attribution you should be able to pull it up easily so we made this publicly available
 and then I attended a conference in a stolen heirloom cybercon and there was a small group of experts so you know associated with this topic we had discussion yet working with Microsoft to discuss the idea that we presented in the report and a lot of the feedback was very positive a lot of people recognize the challenges that exist here and they also recognize that this will continue to be a very very important issue now there are some experts that do believe that it will not be as effective if you don't have this state-based membership and in fact we anticipated that this may be one of the issues that is criticized
 so for that reason we do believe that there are opportunities for states to contribute information to this organization where the organization would not necessarily have direct access to for example various types of intelligence so for example a nation could choose to be classified information and make it available to the organization another possibility is that a nation may not necessarily release or declassify information that's relevant but they may share information to suggest that the organization may consider looking in alternative Direction and so a lot of those details would need to be worked out but we think that there are ways that Nations could contribute without being direct members
 when you think about how we thought that this organization might be run first while they're couple things to keep in mind so first there is this idea of what would lead to an investigation occurring what would be basically the triggering condition forgiven investigation one of the ways we thought might be useful is to consider the Supreme Court model where the Supreme Court decide every year which cases it will take on so there is a submission of a tremendous number of cases every year and then the Supreme Court essentially goes to a process of deciding which cases it will take on the number of cases that are submitted to the Supreme Court by the way quite large zits on on the order of 8000 cases if they receive every year and obviously they take up much smaller numbers are not in that process of deciding which cases to take on it's very important that the process should
 transparent and as far as possible so to the degree that some key criteria can be laid out that might for example rule out certain cases immediately so that you would know that for example of one criteria might be that the the incident has to impact a certain number of people or must involve a certain you know quantification of damage and if you're below that threshold we're not taking the case on you'd want to work out some of that criteria ahead of time so it will be very very clear that these cases we won't take on a non because they are are not meeting our criteria now one idea that actually came up and one of the conversations I had during the various discussions but this was an idea that was mentioned by Jason Healy and I actually thought it was an interesting idea that that notion was that instead of having victims bring cases Ford in a man
 that's similar to the Supreme Court and then disappear and then the organization would decide whether or not to take on the cases and alternative approach would be to declare criteria for a sufficiently small set of cases that would always be taken on and then the organization instead of receiving request from external victims the organization within seek out cases that meet that criteria and so the idea would be the organization would this would be a way where the organization presumably could be perceived be both transparent and fair and they would stayed up front that any case that meets a certain set of criteria we're going to take it on so I thought that was actually an interesting inversion pressing attack yeah yeah not at the you know that I should have said that way
 attack the problem exactly so I think you know for example if we look at the attack that occurred this past spring where there were hospitals that were taught yep ransomware right exactly this this might be a reasonable way to do you know like if hospitals are attacked because they represent an important aspect of critical infrastructure will take on those cases that might be one way of looking at it and of our time and I want to begin to wrap up at is a lot of stuff I would like to get your insights on an instead of ask you individually cuz we don't have time I'm just going to kind of bundle of a number question the one question so internationally there is the representation of how are conflicts exist between various counterparties between the United States and Ron between the United States and China in the United States and Russia to the United States and North Korea
 it's presented a certain way in the news in each of these individual cases North Korea is this burgeoning nuclear actor but there's not actually a great military solution maybe it's a war of ideas China is this you know it's the there is a conflict with China it's on the horizon it's inevitable but we don't know how long it's going to take to get there Russia is this constant mettlesome enemy if you're not entirely opposed to to Russia than you know if something wrong with you or your far right so they're extremely polarized narratives and I I know there's Dark Shades of Truth to each of those polarized narratives but what I'm hoping you'll provide with me is maybe the more tempered interpretation of some of these internet of the United States is relationship some of these players or or if not tempered maybe your own like subjective or just what your interpretation is an and how far it deviates from the pub
 understanding I would just love to understand the true nature of these different complex because it's so hard for me to disambiguate what is truth from what is you know bloviation or ostentatious news cycle BS I don't know help me understand me in 5 minutes or less I'm not sure I can definitely speak on precisely what the true nature is here here here is my thinking right now lots and lots of countries engage in cybersecurity one of the points we mention our our report was that there are 30 + countries that have offencive cyber-security activities and as one place I read put it the cost of creating offense of cyber capabilities to a country is on par with deciding that you
 how to win a gold medal the point being that this is not that expensive it's not like saying we're going to engage in a nuclear weapon program which even that to some degree is we it's more prolific than it was decades ago but cybersecurity is a whole lot cheaper and I think we're going to continue to see this in fact just this past spring a new apt was mentioned a PT 32 that was attributed to the Vietnamese and you know Vietnam with all due respect is not the kind of country that you would expect to say 5 years ago would be noted as having offense of cyber security operations we're going to continue to see this proliferation right now the United States is a clear leader we have tremendous cybersecurity capabilities we also have tremendous cable bill
 needs to engage in your investigative authoritative investigations but just as with the rest of the world becoming flat largely due to decreased cost in technology
 we will likely see the world continue to become flat in this domain as well and something needs to happen and I think this is why Microsoft is interest in this at the end of the day when you think about Microsoft they and other technology providers are essentially the the landscape upon which this Warfare is being fought and so they're kind of caught in the middle at a certain level and and they just recognize that this you know this war will continue so we're kind of in this wild wild west plays we have a few people that have you know bigger guns and everyone else but there is a a wagon of guns heading our way that's going to be available for lot more players and we just risk this going out of control so it won't just be the name that you mentioned the Russia the China's the North Koreans
 it'll be many many other countries that are involved and that's not even to mention then non-state actors right so they're obviously lots of non-state actors crime syndicate that will be engaged in this as well so something needs to happen so I don't know if that was exactly the answer you were looking for that certainly how I feel all right.

Transcription: monitoring translate machine data into actionable business metrics and it is a key component of a modern software company James turnbull's new book The Art of monitoring and describe how organizations can build their monitoring infrastructure James joins the show today to outline the strategies that a company can use to proactively monitor their systems we talked about pull versus push base monitoring events logging metrics and James experience as CTO of Kickstarter he's also had several prominent roles that other companies before we get to that episode a few quick announcements this software engineering daily Community has started working on a project called software daily we're building an open-source news and information site about software and if you're a web developer working with react JS or nodejs or other web Technologies check out the software daily repo which you can find by going to software daily.com you can also go to software engineering and
philly.com where I can find out how to become a host for software engineering daily you can finally see the slack Channel my Twitter account my email you can sign up for a newsletter software weekly featuring curated content and that's about it so with that let's get to it this episode of The Art of monitoring with James Turnbull after a quick message from today's sponsor
 everyone is talking about serverless architectures and for good reason it allows you to manage less infrastructure and deliver more results at the Forefront of this activity is the serverless framework popular open source application framework that makes it easy to build your serverless architecture on AWS Microsoft Google and IBM the team behind the framework has recently been funded by the investors behind Docker New Relic and hashicorp and they're looking for experienced serverless minded developers and evangelists to join them if you have strong engine experience with AWS Lambda elasticsearch dynamodb and red shift or if you have experience building large developer Focus communities please go to serverless. Com and apply let them know that you heard from us software engineering daily thanks to server list for being a sponsor of software engineering daily we really appreciate it and with that let's get on with this episode of
 software engineering daily
 James Turnbull is the author of The Art of monitoring and is currently the CTO of Kickstarter James welcome back to software engineering daily thank you were having it back I'm excited to be here I really enjoyed the last time I spoke your book starts off with an overview of the history of monitoring and it's told Through The Eyes of a sysadmin working at a fictional company called example.com and is company seems to be a late 90s or early 2000s company and you explain how the changes to the IT industry start to necessitate a change in the infrastructure at example.com and those changes in infrastructure end up altering the way that the company needs to do monitoring what are those fundamental changes that are happening to the average companies infrastructure and how is that changed monitoring
 Chaucer the reason I chose the average companies because I think so too startups more often than not set of had somebody clue here but there's a lot of people out there in the world who have looser this changes that that that don't quite understand like what we need to do next and a big thing that's happened in the industry is it said of twofold one is that about 10 years ago things started to become rich lost so I previously you know she said means job was to manage you know of X number physical machines and like you said the metric of like she said means per machine or sewing machine supposed to side mean as soon as you head towards the bottom it's not only did the number of environments dramatically X the scope of control change to sorry that virtual machines were managed by developers by TBI by different groups by marketing teams might have a virtual machine and it became hot or not but she said means to manage that
 the next Evolution that happened was cloud computing so I know what does the number of instances X but sometimes I think that could be running multiple and wax the difficult things that are there varying degrees of control like AWS you can recover see you know a lot about what's going on the on individual instance but maybe not so much about the networking in some cases it's my phone was a service or software-as-a-service that you using in which guys a lot of positive things like the operating system and its performance are a black box 27 can you give me a synopsis for how to use changes have altered your work for the front of vantage point of your career the different places you've worked how have you observed these changes two things one is it
 it was definitely I ate the days where you could set up monitor memory disk and CPU and an unexpected that would give you some sense of comfort that things were okay maybe making sure that I can Apache Services running awesome like that. Those those are gone specific memories you have of the different companies that you bought it because I mean for people who don't underestimate a very storied career working a lot of prominent companies do you think of these different companies as you know you penalizing these different Generations in the way the infrastructure has worked and the way monitoring has worked I think the definition of the best example of that is that I worked in several very large financial institutions and thought I'd be part of a team of people who would have to do with an outage and on the music on a conference call and the decent some people from the business to a wired about the other see that the service that is not available to a customer but decent people
 Oceanside of things who would be good Hood built the application fee maybe some came from. Or storage in Rocky the DBA Hazel storage people they were out so stuck to a telecommunication company Madison Security folks and then the base of operations and C-17 folks but not the picture and the number of times where I sat in a call when you get to the end of the you get to the set of root cause order order for the reason of all this happening and you don't see each other on the head because she team had some application Matrix maybe you had some Mika structure Matrix over the network team had a traceroute maybe the. Attain had some you know some cool or I will storage Matrix that are important
 awful experience to it's very unpleasant when you got a bunch of the front hole through my show it's not their fault to actually try and come up with like I said this is what's going wrong he's how we fix it where is a look at the reason to look at monitoring has a more holistic thing which is where you look at all of those teams should have this visibility of the same. They should all be looking at the same dashboards and being on the site I can correlate like the the speed of these grades on on the storage a ride with this. Network performance I'm here and I can see that's impacting the applications ability to serve out this particular bit of contento this transaction okay now we got a picture of where would cause my fate
 but in this also illustrates one of the motifs of your book which is that the monitoring ties and very closely to the business itself and you get you should have your monitoring system structured so that it can generate business value rather than being this reactive thing and it will get into that but the title for a little bit and the title is the art of monitoring why is the focus on monitoring as an art rather than as a science science I think of is more rigorous and well-defined but perhaps there are just so many things that you can buy on it or there's no one right way to do things that monitoring has become an art
 I think the art place is really about putting all the pieces together so I think if you the one of the reasons I write the book but you up there a handful of players with varying levels of maturity and as a handful of sub is a very level of adoption I use a William Gibson quotes talk about this in stock futures not evenly distributed to some people have deep insight into their environment and have everything Matrix around everything all the companies are very little inside and definitely around some of those two minds on like if you dig into the wild around things like
 availability and resilience response time like this definitely science of in the Stephanie people who have really deeply thought about how to measure like in Twin transaction performance for Cent talks about the patients and just definition science around the idea that now you shouldn't use averages anymore you should think about different ways of measuring measuring your your performance and that that sample size resentful that if you're only looking at the phone once every 10 seconds you are quite likely missing Peaks and troughs sorry things like the st. Al's become extinct we are looking at a distribution of offers alts is very accurate already is the future is here it's just not evenly distributed yet and and so which is to say that the future is here for some organizations for others it's not quite here yet and the way that you talk about this is
 is this three-level maturity model where you're reflecting the different stages of monitoring Evolution at particular organization and every company has some kind of monitoring whether it's simply their logs or that's what they're calling monitoring or it's an extremely Advanced system like Google and the way that you classify these types of maturity are manual systems and reactive monitoring systems and proactive monitoring system explain how an organization's monitoring system might Advance through these three levels as an organization matures in public works and what they do is they they go okay
 I've seen this error before like when the website shows this thing that says you know. Of ice not available I remember what the developer said he said go to this machine or she said go to this machine and talk no service at my school all day you restart and and I run that and something happens and sometimes and sometimes it doesn't and my previous experience and vision place in response to things that have gone wrong Way Stockton CA okay well some of these and you implement a program tomorrow so that all of the things involved and you probably look at it in terms of like okay there's three things broke so I'm going to put checks in place for these sweet tea three things
 the wrong again I should get a notification in and I should be out of context it can use your monitoring build soda organically like that and at some point in time the business starts to ask you to know like if you were building reacted monitoring you're probably time to stabilize the environment to do this. This I will you want to hire 3 more Seaside means and that's going to cost me this much money tell me how that's going to make the the transaction system run three times faster like
 add more and more on the top of top end of that reacted sings the business is starting to be aware that that small differences in performance and small differences in user experience tangible an important customers if you had a bad experience buying a Kindle book or buying your your guy that's going to cause this considered matter brain damage and you may not go back to that company so if you have a Pole Experience like this as a tangible impact on the bottom line for the business says we need to spend that money what do want to spend it on in order to get that better user experience if you want to tell the business that you have to do it okay let's find out let's do some user research let's talk about that they don't like the fact that it takes 2 seconds to put when they could check out it takes two seconds to launch the
 how to check out page. Maybe after one second I'll stoled no checkouts would convert at your some high percentage you can actually know that okay minute-to-minute these are the business metrics I care about like time on on on a particular IP or if its location and you know that you can turn to make that better you know that the constraint on your IQ I at least the fact that describes I will really slow if we added I ran to this particular machine over here I can actually see that look like oh my God
 what does impact monitoring turn off all of those things become something that you are the business and technology are now working in Partnership to make the user experience and therefore the value of the company better yeah I think when you get these monitoring hooks in place and you have a lot of visibility you can really get more value out of the the people who are analyzing your business whether they are highly technical people or not cuz you know it's not like we're not at the point where we can just have machines analyze all of the data in our system and say oh there's the point where you can get more business value out of your entire system we still need people who are analyzing these dashboards and saying oh I just noticed that
 I'm looking at this graph over here and then I'm looking at this other crap over here and I noticed there's there's a correlation between this type of situation and the end the only way you can have that kind of that kind of bacon your organization is if you have these monitoring systems proactively facilitated and that you gave the example of Amazon I think Amazon is talked very publicly about how they have identified how much money they lose on every additional microsecond of latency and it says quite significant the only way they can they can have Optics into that sort of thing is by baking in very proactive monitoring systems
 so in this book you propose an architecture for a monitoring framework this is a generalized architecture what are the components of this architecture Choice obviously the tricky thing and then again where the reason why I ask is that I want to ask solution tricky different types of Technology manager so I try to find something that's what it talked about if you wouldn't do this holistically and how would you do it so I said that I think the best approach to monitoring is is a push by stock ticker essentially the things that you monitor generally speaking I meet the Matrix that order a meet the doctor that you want and those are soaked up by bike infrastructure around it sorry at the operating system level you know you were mixing the traditional set of metric CPU and memory in network performance
 stop application that will your code is instrument in such a way that key subsystems and safety components it's pretty cool I'm meet Matrix regular decide this is Mike this is my latency this is the number of transactions at least number of goals are collected and then. Centralized depending on and then I see you treat you trying to keep that a very high resolution to try and look as often as possible I I recommend the people that you should be collecting his second resolution second resolution and then you and you made it to graphs or 10 of some kind or summarize it in San wife example you could you could take a light and see Target for a cluster of web service put that all together to generate a single light and see if you get for that cost our generator
 tall from that to demonstrate that you know at the 99% all these uses get a on average a 5-second second response time and there's a small group of users that aren't for that smoker who uses that response time and Trigger or take some action and you talk to human I think that's very true more more that we can say that the human has identified a patent you can codify that Patton in your monitoring and have some sort of automated response examples speed up a new machine and add some web service to the cost of if you know a series of behaviors related to ask you can respond and you know maybe maybe like maybe the depth of the contract is Robaxin or maybe the right up and says
 limo service we estimate response time will be the picture that you know you're storing the graphs a story night by the time series data being able to visualize it and they all went to supplement with things like logs because the phone too and she rolls when is that they know a lot of applications and services and meet logs when things go wrong you can't tell it to tell you more than what it already does it possible to use login trees to to be over the car like things like okay I log entry generated every single time this transaction runs I can get a light and CEO of count from from this particular login tree if I aggregators together and do some processing on top of them
 play Stand a pole base model number search I think this is pretty core to the conversation can you get your talk a bit about how those two types of infrastructure differ and why push is preferable to be the most sodas I guess controversial argument I make all the tree out of checks or triggers for checks and I want to God's it says it reaches a list of systems like a all applications on periodically and says tell me what the the information you have about your CPU and it brings that information back and check it against whatever state you can think about this stand your that's a that's a problem
 that model has a couple challenges from my point of view the first one is that it generally needs to it's been really hard to Sky like it's a single Central monolithic thing that that offer Centerpoint time in separate Cummins Negros know is that it takes more time to run the checks then the interval between a check so I know if you want to say one of its going to check once every 5 minutes then it takes longer than 5 minutes to does a q of ticks it takes longer than 5 minutes to run that check and therefore you know you and episode of getting further and further behind. Directions and things you can run so you're tooling systems and imperialization also stuff but I'll ask around some people out there that Tim to give a presentation how do I Scout Nike SB shoes velocity
 aborigine does out of the box I think they're better check and then every time I make it more often like if you're spending on cloud instances of etching machines seconds if you're monitoring system monitor them to that. Of time because they they don't know about them all they need to converge the knowledge about the needs to converge Talent solving that service Discovery and require a level of skill that I am not sure that is necessary to solve this problem but she said it will show you know you mentioned is controversial is it controversial because it puts more responsibility in the hands of the developers that are developing services
 I have to put in their own monitoring Hooks and they have to push monitoring data to the overall monitoring infrastructure it's mostly controversial because to some extent Ides and death example of folks from the Google school of a very strong uses of of the pool by System Pokemon which is the internal Google tolol and Prometheus which some of the team at SoundCloud who are mostly X Google folks or supper Community developed a more advanced systems and I think from the first pullback system apps in a long time that I look at it okay I could probably would probably eat that for the best technology that uses
 I feel that is a very sophisticated choice I don't feel it's a choice that's oriented towards that's what a collaboration you talk about where developers DBI Seaside Bar Mitzvah. So that's that's where it is I have I have reasonably hockey debates or some of these folks about this than a variety of different reasons and contacts and things like that
 you're not going to sacrifice model of the system is then and you're monitoring system has a series of things that it says I'm I'm going to collect data from from things that pop up for example I don't need to tell it as long as I'm going to meetings High CPU and memory latency or some other pussy was a metrics then I'll use a tool karimun which is in a venti iced collectors an example of how to do this Century women just text every Eventing and it looks so it's Lisa between rice and says do I do anything with this event but I'm at they probably throw a Time series data bytes to be graphed tool or something like that but he doesn't need to know about any of that if a new host of peas then it says in the field do I have to do
 no I don't have to appear and disappear and the Deathly ways to make that more robust like if you ignore if you are worried about like I know you can do things like have a service Discovery tool that appears it registered so for The Sims Discovery tool any monetary system then goes okay I should get a list of the lightest custom M is for this thing that that's my job is I see that check come in at 8 that I have the current list of custom to listen to you on that to the group in a region write the percent all Island and pasta at metricon
 I just read a lot of feels like a more Dynamic why I was looking at the world and it feels like a y instead of this a phrase that I watch the things you need to use the tow trucks backed by competing which books about pets and people enjoy your trip to infrastructure is that and they all days you have to stop to had A9 like it was cold cook or Spock and it was a server for a long time and when approached you clean stating they fixed it and if you live in the Amazon has a name like I-87 b23i and if it stops you probably wrong with the server list Paradigm you don't even care about that you don't you don't know what happened you done everything to be Julie you know
 I'm in the business of that like hearing about all of us patient instructor I think we're going to last on this care about that
 if you want to learn about kubernetes go to aprender.com se daily today you can find a webinar about kubernetes covering microservices persistence and multiple clusters you can also find links to a past webinar covering of the history the origins and the technical architecture of kubernetes the webinars at aprender.com se daily are hosted by Joseph Jack's a member of the cloud native Computing Foundation who was previously a guest on software engineering daily if you're looking to move to a cloud made of infrastructure platform that works with your existing apps you should also check out a printed.

 so talking more about the data they were collecting an R monitoring framework you suggest that the framework centers around 3 events logs and metrics explain how they complement each other
 events iicsn as a point in time they are I am example at this time at this time at this time at this point this particular point was 1.1 somethings and event essentially yard but it's in combined with all the data points so you can be raising the bat test is a two-fold purpose here when is it is diagnostic code for the time you want to keep logs because they tell me what they show you the event as it as it appeared like I can see why we shall be too stressed out about your login trees and and then he is a series of
 I can step back to that and goat cheese the code pop that went wrong in his wife went home to steal metrics and and. Points from logs I can either treat the individual login Teresa's daughter points or I can generate login trees that contain Matrix of Summer description I think about Matrix as collections of data points like several people who actually know something about she stinks I having small heart attacks as I say that because people out there who who will be like about about a metric Five Points... I could find some useful information that I'm probably looking at over a period of time
 I think that I would I am an absolute Cowboy for for for for being awesome Luke to someone definitions that's my intent events are generated from the business logic or the application or the operating system does an organization need to define a certain format for events because if I'm pushing my events from my application to a centralized monitoring service do I need to have a standardized format through on my organization I think at the very least the the community of people that are looking at those events probably need a standardized so I can I really think you need to Define like
 locations and an angiography or or applications in some standard kind of way and almost certainly there is someone in your organization to test something about daughter without a science Moon because a big. Of him up sometime I bet you anything that have a schema I bet you anything you could probably steal that steamer or modify or extend it but I do think it's important to understand that if if I'm a group of people sitting over a series of metrics and put it on the distributor group of people I want to have a really good idea I'll be on the walk the path of that deposit and understand that we talking about apples and apples and a lot of the time particularly with things like Matrix you know you'll slap yourself in the head of the CPU and you're looking at all crap like that.. Like this is why this. It doesn't reconcile I'm looking at something in his account and you'll look in something is up
 reasons why if your application is a meeting events that are not clearly defined and your infrastructure is a meeting events that also clearly Define how you can miss interpret Sky Alyssa's of Sky pictures of ratio or whatever happened to be maybe that's for a pole based infrastructure is the people pulling the metrics Kenda find the schema enforce it more rigidly and I must have your audience attention is Ryan and I would I do that almost all of those Engineers probably have a stall God of some kind like like I think it's useful I also have a dollar signs team and we we have events that that that that no trigger on saffron and drink check out to check out of
 anyone who is an engineer is used to working and I can school of practice and I have an install God this is just like instead of instead of having my code review for like you know. Stop using the old phone with you like you should really have a stats the metric for for this particular method because how we going to know what's happening this is really important. I know the finance team wants to see dollars put a country we definitely should MC instrument that smart ring is not an afterthought it is a picture and it's on rod and reel code is not complete until all of all of those peaches are at least the minimum viable product stage what about the event router you mentioned this earlier research who are unfamiliar with modern we have no idea what an event router is who could you explain what that piece of infrastructure is in
 how you integrate it into your workflow
 yeah so essentially is is is a stateless so what it is is it it's it's a listener think about it like a it's a it's a point to a client after it's picked out of Vents and the router and expose events into a passionate says I'm going to analyze each of these events based on a series of rules rock and roll so they say your man comes into the pool
 this event is for the Apache service that goes down this path and the Apache Service events Mike this event is a failed service of a disadvantage is Craigslist is a side by sides of of of a of a request that gets grounded to Grandpa and graft and the tickets about that event or if it is essentially descansen and others I just purely a rose engine engineering software engineer this is the same thing like a rules engine
 got it so the events that are hitting the event router they get redirected or route it into a storage system for metrics what are the requirements for a metric storage system
 what kind of depends on on on on what you want to do with things are II I've used a very simple system agreed to go to Uncle Grandpa on your Prime requirement is whatever system is it the backend must be over to write Matrix is hard wine events in them sorry if it's under drops event so or loses them back logs or some like that then it's so much you see sorry the biggest challenges usually skyling buddies all those events in some form that I can do something useful with you know that there is a tool I can layer over the top to visualize the Residence Inn pool of Time series data I don't know anyone who collects that for the psychic collecting it you know you very much like you want to you want to put it through until probably. Atul like a dude to do and now
 Cecil you want to drop something like grafana which is that a visualization truly over-the-top to say show me a dashboard of graphs that told me the current state of North Scottsdale Road this group of service I mean what is the relationship between the stored metrics and the visualization software like that if I'm a developer and I want to set up a visualization tool over my events that are being monitored what do I need to know about that
 Singapore thing is to understand what the numbers inside does events mean so like you know like this is a account of something it's collected every every one second and you know I should create a graph that shows I should just be able to throw this event on something in every. Appointed show me a line across the pipe if I if I look at something guy actually this is this is a timer captured every 10 seconds on Ultra Teddy Tuesdays I may need to manipulate that daughter in some way by most of those
 maybe I'm I'm going to offend Somebody by took about 5 shots but maybe I want to look at the pie chart of all the countries that make up the value of my dog just like I'm on the look-out mic night 20% of Revenue comes from the US 5% from Canada 15% from the UK and I want to go to the show because I'm staying like understanding what the daughter is generally allows you to do a gated and stored and visualized we need to actually monitor our hosts to generate data if I spend up a new service ID to monitor that host and generate data and put it through this this architectural pipeline what are the central goals of host monitoring
 generally speaking I look at a person I can die I try to identify what are the base metrics that I'm probably not going to care very much about monitoring using to beat Electric Slide Christina classic example is used to monitor CPU and they used to have an alert that went off your see if you want to buy you the same honestly yeah sure I thought I don't necessarily A Bad Thing, not hugely caring about those metrics as I are they contribute to state of mind they don't they don't make out something I want to I care about on a on an individual basis so I think stuff like a disk memory disk storage disk performance memory CPU
 find Donna that I want to collect the Savannah have the background to be able to drill into but I'm probably not going to take any action on set of metrics that it says okay we're going to monitor this on every single post and then you can go from there and added more things to do typically in suggest something like that to each new service I think I think I think that if you want to make apples and apples comparison across the environment having that that but that Drew. Even go down to it's like okay I see this transaction before men's okay that's really interesting because it's different on this machine for this machine twice that of that machine I don't necessarily care that it's describes a twice but if I can call her like that. Ah with some other high-level metric that might be important
 what we discussed so far can you give a description for how an example of vent would be generated on a host and propagated all the way to the top layer where I can visualize it sure Charlotte's Web Service and the service is mine is is my check out kind of flies that we click submit that submit the payment System payment system goes off to a payment for SSI authorizes that event and I generate a metric to metric is the username the value of the transaction and the state code of the country code for the shipping address metric is generated by the application and the pops into some sort of agent on the machine for example like a real eye of some kind
 Pandora like in the case of the prologue stats dating IBEW you point directly to Stats Lisa Vero some like that that's ever been text the event and maybe miniature lights in some way maybe you can potentially summarizing example she might want to tell you need to side to side dishes instead of Jiffy switches are a very stupid why the colonel contacts a few things about to turn into a percentage of Bruce Willis's daughter and then it generates that event then get past it if I don't I hate school the hearts I am in a service name
 is the country code for the event and says I'm going to do two things I'm going to add up all of the together and I'm going to put it down the pipeline with all of the other dollar amounts and I'm going to spit it out to where the graph database and I'm going to store it as the as the US dollars of $2 and I have a grass that the finance team watches every day and it shows you are a 24-hour crisis the amount of dollars someone's picking the sock I'm going to grab that I'm going to shoot that off to the thing and I'm going to I'm going to show a visualization showing
 the countries that did my customers come from or I could show up like I could tell I can tell him that we're heat map showing which countries are broadcast and exercise away my most of my customers off maybe on the marketing team cares about that as as as as as a as a practice I can say oh wow I've got this event and it's like it's a $0 transaction that's definitely a bug so I'm going to Route any $0 transactions to the application support team and I'm I'm on the way I might pick up some other daughter on one side other invention that host let's put together a little bit of a package showing like the current state of all the metric and I do this in the rest points in the book where I saw you like he is an alert that contains contextual information things like he's alert that shows five or six other metrics that are also relevant to them
 well that service and that bad example might be I'm number of transactions or some like that and I'll generate some simple like maybe I'll send an email and I will shoot that Ella to application support at example.com and I get a list of all of the transactions and see if I'm not going to keep track of all those your little things if I get more than 10 an hour I'm going to dinner at that a lot so they might be an actual problem is when I trigger that a lot
 that's great you also spend significant time in the book talking about log processing what are the requirements for a log processing framework and how does it fit in with the components that we have discussed so far so traditionally log formats a minion buried and they originally emerge from the need for something to be human readable the Damon that Unix uses to dinner right side of events on potato to Logan Institute something happened It's relatively easy to look at that event and say this happened at this time on this machine from this service and he's a message. That tells me like the Apache service has stopped but if you think about it
 waiting to both messages generally having anything while I'm still want to do is I want to say what could a how can I construct a love message that contains only useful. Uh but is in a phone that is controlled by machine so I can rewrite my application to generate a Jason cash for my login trait that contains in RI used for name of the service of the generated it maybe contains a block of text that's the stock price maybe contains a line number from a cut from code or metric or some of the daughter of some kind and I should go and try to move all of my logs towards something that I found that a machine could chew and then there are lots of Logan's rolls out there that he was out there that that can essentially consume that dice on hash
 sign those values into a into a dollar into a form I need a lockout event rather take some action example if it identifies that you're the component is payment system and the area code is is total failure on and you know then I should trigger on a lot for it says okay he is a stock price I'm going to bundle at stock price up together with any surrounding events and shoot it off to a do I help the system unlock a ticket Texas stream of consciousness of the thing on you meme I want to look at that lighter is a diagnostic tool but it was exactly the same way as an event that can be consumed and reused and how many glad we could do an entire show on the e l k stack the elasticsearch logstash kibana stack wood could you explain what that is
 of civil log infrastructure that people sit set up sometimes on the used search search tool like ice all over the side of things based on them in the same way that I could think about your your login trees as as as I should have this the documents that it's towards love stash is very much like a knot on a bed router it it's not spiteful essentially you texting events in various involvement in various forms and it pauses them to read them and then it it it it types actions based on one of my status exam only events from this particular service gets sent to to be stored these other events get get routed sideways to add graphing engine and turned into a graph
 I'm these events triggered an alert and then it at the back end of a deposit into elasticsearch indexes all the login trees pre much like any set of search what do you know you've got a set of device is this Angelea. I said full of water is a graphical user device that sits on top of that and it allows you to do things like show me all of the log events for this particular system where this criteria was true and then grab that for me so I can see all of the era's from my payment system by count in Cabana
 okay great let's talk more broadly and we're running up against time last 10 or 15 minutes how how do you scale a monitoring system what are the main challenges to a scaling a monitoring system
 it really is around the city of volume sorry that's the primary Sky Island challenges that at some point in time you might be pulling more vents are pushing more events the Monarch system they can come up with and there's a couple of ways of dealing with that in some cases you can throw be going to Shane's walk Cassidy at it all the cases you make shotgun with your system so much like a shot of database you might say all of the machines in this class of things over this. Of Center open this application go to one event router and all of these other machines go to another event router and maybe you'll central point of identification is Central console for the team that looks after the service or division of a company I will maybe there's a series of tiered consoles that that roll up increasingly Grant decreasing to let granny love me some information she gets the very top of that I used to work for SSAT
 if you just got back from meeting with that that the CEO and said to me off the CEO would like the shows in the overall side of the business like if more than most critical Mission Cisco Systems are on working then that would be an orange like it if um if more than 15 or working at it be a red line and you just want that on the screen like that's nice isn't also. But he knew that. They gave him a pretty good feel for where we were on a daily basis they wanted to go down and get pick up the structure is pretty common in a lot of organizations about things
 the second part of Skylar Neese complexity sorry you have the most complex those I strongly strongly recommend people or tonight checking like doing checks so nephews against aggression management system or you know you you store checks tonight in Kodi repositories I'm kind of automatically generate them from using a thing as a Love Song, and it's my dad I think that that's a far easier way of managing at the monitoring tools out there have testing Frameworks so testing on that you can actually write test fuel monitoring test so that's it that's a really needs to know you can you can stop out those tests on an application level eight and stop them out a new construction thing tonight I expect and want to fix system expect to see the speed of data in this form otherwise I understand if so it'll trigger this a lot I can do things like that with motor system that allow you to
 I just seen what you manage applications manage that complexity by making them testabolan and making them so controlling
 Ezra talking about building are monitoring infrastructure we can choose to buy things we can choose to build things we can choose to do some combination of the two we had a very interesting show a while ago about Sumo Logic the architecture. That works which is log Processing Company and there are other log processing companies like log Lee I think of this is just one component of the monitoring system that you could essentially Outsource to a service how do you choose between what to build and what to buy
 I think it really comes down to Toccoa business and comes down to capacity so a lot of people implementing something like this is not an endorsement but it's something like New Relic myself a lot of your problems like that cuz it's an easy dropping like I added to your page bass tackle your baby stack hole of Clans hack or whatever Java Center it and it automatically comes with a bunch of things. That work for you in analyzing the.. It's designed for many many people to to look at that. I'm sorry that the dashboards are designed for the most common you said if you guys its structural technology or things that you particularly care about like a nightmare I don't know that that this particular system over here is the most important system and this particular transaction
 transaction fees for you if you on the other hand like you know we categorically have to be over to have these application that will make sure you know we should build something in the house to do that that might be a pop you might do some combination of Outsourcing The Matrix example companies like a dog for Amazon cloudwatch service you may have them collect all up at that sadata and maybe sportiva summary of forward you that. I shouldn't have to take care of the collection face so I really think it comes down to if you have the skills in house and it's cool to you that this particular thing is mounted then you should that's a good decision around building elevation Sunoco to you maybe that sounds awesome opportunity cost you lose from building features you have to build something in the ass that's a cop X
 Acosta Acosta 222 building things in-house does a cap X cost to out so soon um I spy pie spices you work at Kickstarter how do you apply the concepts that you outlined in the book to your work a Kickstarter
 we are very metrics-driven organization so we on WE collect a lot of data we have a lot of graphs so no we have similar principles I call it the you know like if everyone in the company gets a daily email that says like this is the amount of money collected across these projects in these countries and he had the most profitable successful projects he staying the categories that are doing well this week I can do something maybe it's games is the good Dinosaur Project reflecting on this date at motoring YouTube business data so that's that's the way we we we we look at that it would look at that or intensive and daughter team generates we're going to the dashboard out in the structure and the folks who could always just talk to each other things I win gineering teams with apple every time we deploy like everyone's eyes
 block to the graph that shows the current HD tb200 to show we are very gross and net eccentric organization we probably don't apply like this book is very much I am. Again after I think as a start-up reasonably advanced technology Community, I don't know that we have some of the same issues but the reason I wrote the book was because they were lots of people out there had conversations with you would like I don't know where to start with an a kick out of these talks he's really smart folks from places places like Etsy and Google and I got to go, I'm just Flexin the things I've done and I look at that tools and I just don't know where to start and I don't have this many Engineers what do I do and that's that sounds like a hot potato
 I heard that every single monitoring program ever given is someone going please tell me how I get gstaad monitoring hierarchy of needs probably applies here in many ways to everything your book obviously what are the other topics that we did not have time to explore that are in the book The you like to highlight you know you probably didn't talk very much about a loading I think it's important to Rockwood alerts and I talked about. A big machine consumable alerts are the things that humans consume so they need to be contextual information is going to wake somebody up at 3 in the morning I want to be able to bounce out of bed in your I see exactly what the problem is I have enough information I can actually keep my brain into gear and solve this problem
 don't wake me up in John what the fuck is the only reason why language how do I have to spend on information to have to get the humans like visualizations in the woods should be she should treat it like a product you should interview those people who do user research send them samples give me the way I found it useful what else would be useful and treated like a pot of situation and that's how I know we didn't talk much he said chocolate like I'm on a train make a feature of an application you should treat your mother cook system like a product you should ask the uses who I'm not you you're generally there are other people out there with his I should you are not the customer if you're not the only customer anyway you should ask them what they eat
 want to know when this happens more often than not the business is always stand that you know all of these things and they like passing in Wisconsin always runs out of this product it's because it's right next to the hear this stuff like that absolutely ecstatic that you know by using how popular you become if you are able to provide people with context about the things will make their lives easier
 James turbo I love your book thanks for thanks for reaching out and I'm glad we had this conversation about the art of monitoring hope everybody checks it out by the book also thank you so much, I really had fun talking
 thanks to sinfonico for sponsoring software engineering daily symphonica is a custom engineering shop where senior Engineers tackled big Tech challenges while learning from each other check it out its symphony.com SE daily that's s y m p h o n o. Com SE daily thanks again Stefano

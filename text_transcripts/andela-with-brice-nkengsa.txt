Transcription: Africa has a huge reservoir of untapped technical talent and tech companies have a huge amount of work that they need skilled employees for undella is a talent accelerator that finds people in Africa who are eager to learn software skills and then trains them in a six-month boot camp and pairs them with jobs at companies such as Microsoft Bryce king size is the director of engineering at on Della and he joins the show today to discuss on Della this episode touches on many of the themes of software engineering daily boot camps scaling an organization microservices the future of work obviously Africa quite an interesting episode hope you enjoy it
continuous integration is so useful that I've started using it on my own personal projects snap CI from thoughtworks has the fastest setup I've ever seen I registered for SNAP CI with my GitHub account and after a few clicks I had continuous integration pipelines setup for a no JS application and a rails application that were just sitting on my GitHub account and I don't want my users to experience breaking changes so I want to run a large sweet of test for my application every time I push a change and snap see I will run those tests quickly in parallel on a worker that snap CI spins up and takes care of for me what do you have personal projects like me or you work at a company that is looking for the perfect tool to improve the deployment process go to snap. Co / software engineering daily snap CI and bodies the lessons that thought Works has learned from 20 years of software deployment the same lessons that have been written
stop by Martin Fowler and Jazz humble check it out it's snap. Co / software engineering daily it would support software engineering daily and you would get to check out continuous-deployment snap. CI / software engineering daily thanks for listening
 breast cancer is the director of engineering for andhala Bryce welcome to software engineering daily
 Salon Della is a talent accelerator so we we recruit the most talented people young people in Africa and we train them to be world-class technologist join undella
 so we have a recruitment program and we have applications that go out every quarter I think we currently recruiting people in Nigeria and in Kenya through this application process what are the types of people that join on Della what are their ages or what's the prototypical type of person that ends up joining the accelerator
 we have people usually young people between Adobe is 19 to 25 26 and usually people from a wide range of backgrounds so we have people who have leprosy completed computer science degrees engineering degrees of people who have no experience in computer science on all some people coming from no radio or music or no all different kind of background so I just interested in time and software development do they have some sort of shelf pot experience like having taken some Coursera courses or something like that
 what does always I think some some of them have a really big interest in software development but as well we do have an online curriculum that we be exposed to applicants so that they can kind of go in and try different things learn the basics like HTML CSS the basics of computer science and before they actually apply to. Can you describe the application process in more detail cuz just don't understand scale thousands of people applying in a very small subset of people end up making it in and so there's this multi-step application process where you screen people in a variety of ways explain some of the deals that act application process
 so like I said it depends with the online curriculum so we encourage anybody that is interested in joining the program to go to the curriculum and can I get a custom with the computer science application on the application consists of a bunch of questions maybe some
 test questions so around poop problem solving and like the fun profile that is
 and then the front profile it's actually kind of like finding the archetype of the person to like their emotional intelligence and things like that and then after that the complete a attack so we have our own assessment form that we have exposed to them while they complete a couple of coding challenges and after that a subset of them are
 recruited for a R Us are selected for a 2 in boot camp so you need to eat with candy come into our offices for a two-week versus boot camp where they build Noah's a Project's Web projects change it to a boot camp and after the 2-week boot camp selected to you are admitted to the program right and I like the multi-step funnel I like the bench marking on emotional intelligence and it seems somewhat contrast to the ways that standardized testing approve people or or disapprove people from entering a college system it seems a little bit more meritocratic a little bit more aligned with what actually makes a person successful beyond their schooling. Of Education
 did you did you always have that that application process or did you do you have do you start with a site with different application process and iterate on it
 which Eatery Donuts I think the first application process was more there was no online curriculum there was no sort of testing procedure that was more around problem solving and emotional intelligence to figure out the best people that would be that will succeed in the program and we ended up getting a wide range of people so and because we also want to kind of streamlined are learning and the training program where we can predict how many people have 5 people can get some extent so we need to make sure that everybody coming in have some sort of Baseline so that's what we kind of sorry I didn't just noticed that process where we have you create one expose people can start getting a person with to learn the Technology Center
 does the degree cooler and the two-week boot camp was revised multiple times with a reader on it on how to invest selective with the people and yeah so when it's it's a process work right we're always here waiting on you show the two-week boot camp so
 Regina budget shows about boot camps coding bootcamps describe your coding bootcamp what are the objectives what are the types of coursework curriculum that are focused on and what do you bench marking the participants on in that. Of time
 so what camp is it illegal to camp on the boot camp is
 I just recorded this is this is like this is to this is like the last phase of the screening process to see if if if people get into on Della and once I get into Adela through that 2 week bootcamp process there is a six-month training process is that accurate
 yes I so the boot time is the final stage of the final stage of the recruitment process and anybody that makes it through the boot camp is officially officially accepted into the program and yes the first 6 months or so are in the first season of The Learning but the over the whole the whole program is for years but the first 6 months is just like the first phase of the learning before our developers are
 I guess you can you can say this the first graduation card thing where if you come under the covers right so for years that's almost but it sure I am here a little bit more about this boot camp process and then we'll we'll get into a little bit more about what on Della is like once people make it through the entire application process so what is what's going on during boot camp where it's the last filter of deciding whether a applicant will make it into on Bella
 right balance between bootcamp is a very invasive. Where we threw a lot of challenging problems at them and see how we're looking for Fasteners and see how they pick up the two technologies and the languages of occurring at them in the first week where which is the fundamentals of
 computer science HTML CSS and depending on the boot camp boot camp in different languages in Ruby or python or JavaScript or PHP for example and the second week of the boot camp is more project-based to each individual in the boot camp has to build a set of web project within is a specific amount of time and at the end of the boot camp the present that projects to everybody in the book and write perform well enough in the boot camp to make it into the main curriculum of odella and which is so there's a six-month training process that happens after that and then people from Mandela get hired by companies to do engineering work so we'll get into the discussion of companies hiring people but one of you walk with your what goes on in that 6 months
 learning process
 okay the six months if the initial first 6 months of learning blighted College learning because we we believe that everybody is the champion of your own learning and Angela is really they're just too fascinated that learning so we're not necessarily training in the traditional sense where were telling people what to do so. 6 months call Dad. The first 6 months is a combination of simulations and apprenticeship and simulations is essentially simulating a typical engineering team right so where you have developers you have a team lead typically you have the product owner and they have to build features is impurities from the front corner so we kind of environment and we have different
 are simulations teams Building Products using different languages so ruby-on-rails Django Marlboro or JavaScript or PHP Horror Story
 and we also do mobile development for Android and iOS of the line process and then what we seen is that what solution is great to Cindy engineering environment it still doesn't have the
 it is so not enough because number one the project and building are not really used by anyone that kind of like training project and the pressure is not there to deliver it right so what we do that is like we transitioned into apprenticeship and what that means is we have our own internal engine renting that is building Technologies assistance to help undella operate efficiently so so as part of their learning which transition into a apprenticeship where they get to work with on actual engineering team does users that has deliverables that has a pressure is that has all those things and they get to Apprentice under more experience people where they get to observe her more experienced developers collecting through problems solved challenging problems and think about building products do they get too so we can think of like a friendship as
 $10 being the first client for 40 developer did you go through an academic Computer Science Education
 yes myself I I went to school at the University of Waterloo okay show what is your ZIP code so you know any ongoing discussions that we have on the show is like kind of what should software engineering education look like or what you Computer Science Education look like or are these different things are these disjoint topics are there is there some overlap I think it's interesting because I think if there are the way the way the academic computer scientist taught I feel like it's kind of like the slow route to learning and I feel like when you have a program like on Della that is focused on teaching people to engineer products and you bake in a feeling of pressure you bake in I mean
 Alicia boot camps like I mentioned in his boot camps have this feeling of pressure they have these segments of you know you're working on a project all on your own you have to learn this disability of Independence we all have to learn how to work in teams in this is in stark contrast to many of the ways that academic of your science works of course I think Waterloo is slightly different that's why I think it Waterloo you're forced to do an internship or you at you're supposed to be well program right and I think that I should I was like sparkly inspiration for Adela but I am a very curious about your thoughts on education how academic computer science compares to this boot camp model or this condensed education model is there anything that this condensed education model misses out on is there anything that is great about Academia that cannot be sort of replicated or improved upon by the
 can't model or the you know hyper hyper condensation of Education model I just love to hear your thoughts on that
 I think the traditional academic model is great for learning the principles I think and the condensed model is grade learning the the practices and how to actually do it how to actually build it and I think that's where Waterloo was really great school where the academic setting was focusing a lot on those principles that computer science principles that are very important as a software engineer and and the internship part kind of give us like the Practical experience and that that's the same thing that would kind of hard to implement here because initially we
 we've been hearing a lot on our learning practices and initially we were focusing a lot on the practice and then we ended up getting a bike that are developers didn't really know the principles like principles of computer science and so we have to we are going to take that see if I can figure out okay how can we ensure that our developers are not know missing out on all those fundamental principles algorithm data-structures Diego locations all those things and ensure that our developers had kind of like The Best of Both Worlds or above the world so that's that stuff is not that hard to learn if you start with the Practical material right like that's my impression Lisa can you start by teaching people how do you build practical stuff and then you say okay by the way there's this thing
 call Big O notation by the way here's this thing called dijkstra's algorithm that's like a you know kind of complicated algorithm my impression is that the theoretical stuff is actually much easier to learn if you start with a practical rather than vice versa and the the thing that I think academic computer science gets wrong is the teach the theoretical first and then they expect the Practical to be easier because of that I think you're probably right it's probably easier but I feel if she get too deep into practical and you start creating those behaviors as a professional software engineer and not really thinking about the theory like I kind of missed out on that so I think
 it's a ton is a great discussion to have I think you need to learn the those principles before you get too deep into the practice because the behaviors of the world where you're practicing should be influenced by the principles that you know about and I think I love her and sounds like the some of the early feedback you are also getting from these companies that are hiring people from on Dell like oh these developers are really efficient they're doing a great job but they don't seem to understand theoretical efficiencies and things you would learn by doing formal proofs and interesting so let's talk let's talk more about that too when a non Della engineer comes out of the 6 month
 training process and I guess we haven't talked too much about that training process but people can probably imagine you did mention that there's the training it's essentially a sort of like a you know you replicate the the type of product development that would happen at a company but it's more like in a training environment so you kind of have some training wheels on and then once you get a chance, like a residency for medical personnel or something and after that these people can get hired by big companies how does a company hire on Delta engineers and what kinds of companies are are willing to hire on Dell engineers
 companies heart and were engineers just by contacting us from our web page or contacting one of our sales people and
 the type of companies that we seen that are interested in and Engineers have being from a wide spectrum from Big Enterprises to small startups make mistakes or UPS looking to expand your engineering teams
 and I have heard that some Contracting because it is supposed to be contract because people are not fully is there not they don't become fully employed like it if a microchip Microsoft hires a team took several on Dell Engineers those Engineers are not full-time Microsoft employees there on Della employees else that's not entirely right so employees but they are full members of the engineering team of our clients autopartners so there are the same processes that the companies using the follow the same engineering processes they are there on the stand up you know what temperature spective and all of that and they are fully dedicated to the team of flea embedded in the partners teams and we
 are developers fly out to you or offices fully immersed in salt into the teens and build relationships so that when they are working remotely you know it's it more efficient
 and what I have heard about people who are not full-time employees is there certain Contracting firms that have a strong reputation if they built up over time like Accenture for example Accentra has has a great reputation so a bank for example is perfectly willing to hire Accenture to build its internal I don't know ticketing system or something
 show overtime these Contracting companies build a big powerful brand with where companies feel comfortable hiring them has that been an issue where you've had to sell companies on this idea that Hades Engineers are great they're trustworthy I know on Dell as a new brand but our Engineers are just as good or probably better than the Accenture engineers and you should trust us it has that been a challenge
 yes absolutely in the beginning it was it was a challenge selling two companies that are Engineers I just as talented as anybody and I mean we had to you know I figure out different ways of approaching this but essentially we know and almost all of our clients were delighted by how embedded and how you know good or in his word and have all of them feel like is not a typical Contracting from is really just like an extension of my engineering team is really just remote workers that are part of my team
 and once you get a company to try it out and if it works out within one team in a big company does it spread within the company do people talk about Haley tried out on Della they Metro 18 perfectly everybody in the company should try on Della does that spreading happen or or do you have to continue doing the sort of sales process throughout the organization to encourage other people to try hiring on Dell engineers
 absolutely that happened organically we've always said that our developers are obese housekeeping right so as soon as they join a new company and you're doing a great job they delivering value automatically receive those companies wanting to expand and even create an entire team around these no initial developers that I join the team so definitely we see that interesting so you have a model where you you can't offer hate we can give you a whole team of people to work on a project as opposed to just saying like pay you can just hire this one person and then you know maybe another team hires one person you can you can offer actual just full teams to to carry out a project
 yes absolutely and I mean as part of her four-year program like we said we have a natural progression of new experiences so we have the initial developer in Tempe have different levels like them over and beat level developer team needs and eventually architect and stuff like that so we can definitely provide teams of Engineers that are just kind of like an extension of the teams that the company already has locally is that this happening now is no accident it's not like suddenly somebody thought of the idea and and now it's a time I mean that is true to some extent but also I think that there are
 tools and Technologies and cultural movements that are all conspiring to make this work really well it might be was it
 Outsourcing in the 90s for example probably didn't work as well as it could today because today there's all these tools for transparency and accountability and likes being outside she slack and other communication tools I mean we're having a VoIP call across country and it's like no issue at all and we take it for granted at this point and there's also you know reputation BAE Systems I mean companies are hiring on Dell Engineers with an with the idea that there was a reputation of the engineer that they're hiring and that Engineers aware of their reputation they're not just going to slack off as opposed to how people thought about Outsourcing in the past like you're just hiring this faceless team of people and there's no accountability there the team just to get peanut says okay we're going to check all these boxes on your deliverables
 I think all that conspired should have much higher quality contract worker temporary work whatever you want to call it do you agree with that I totally I think the technology has helped a lot in terms of how people work in distributed waste like Mission slide Skype all those tools even pair programming like you can do pair programming with tree screening Euro and all those things so it is in terms of Bridging the Gap location. Between the workers and making it feel like you know we're all in the same room working together things that sort of standardized how work is done how code is written now like the biggest debate we're going to have about style is tabs vs. spaces or something
 consequential like that wears the past it might just be like you would get your highly variable code quality probably code quality has flattened somewhat gotten overall higher quality people that will have a people have a better Universal understanding of what good code consists of exactly and you have all these tools out there that are standardized good quality like cold climates and you know all those things that contain teams I are using to standardize how people write Cruz

 what I want to quit classify them as the contractor at least at least in the typical census been used I think you know Angela developers are just like any other Engineers will hire except you're working booty literally part of your team and you know it's their employees of your company on your team versus song contractors while you were you know you're pushing out the projects to them and they're working on it and you know coming back to you with the results of tires on Dell employees did they get stock
 if they want to give out they were first then buy it by all means okay but most of the time maybe not or
 they're just very
 I am not too sure about the but yeah I see a mistaken idea in technology companies that employees need to be receiving stock in order to do their best work and I had a really weird and mistaken idea people work at companies for all sorts of different reasons and people can be incentivize to to do work that is effective for the long-term by all kinds of ways I mean this is where I think the reputation system is really important the fact we have all his reputation systems with your time. Facebook or LinkedIn or just people being a long-standing employee vondella so just these different reputation things that have become increasingly public I think hold people accountable in a way that
 people used to talk about o employee needs equity in order to be accountable and that to me seems less true today
 yeah I think I think that companies using Equity to motivate people I think it's more around giving people a sense of ownership into what they're building so I could see if this thing that I'm building the Emoji went to to seed succeed and make it sexy but I can point out was like people have you know different motivation I think for me I believe that people are mostly motivated by you know dear you want to be like you want to be able to like you know do your work and not me silly be micromanaged and you want to be able to master your craft and I'd be able to officially a software engineer you want to be able to be the best at this that you're doing and as well as you know I guess it's sense of knowing that you
 building something that's no bigger than you and that's that's something for a larger purpose so I think those three elements are enough to motivate people but I can see why some companies would offer Equity 6 Corinthians give yourself a Porsche Design Essentials like we're all in this together and we all want to see this succeed
 you are the director of engineering at undella what does that role in Tails were talking about a company that the most require motivation is train people and then get them jobs at companies and there's obviously all kinds of ongoing management of that process but what what kinds of engineering work are you doing with in undella what kind of Technologies do bill to help facilitate this process is to internal tools and products of underwear and two in order to make all the different business units and departments work work efficiently and as well as I talk about apprenticeship also providing that final stage of writing for under the developers as they Advance through that first stage of the program
 and in terms of the type of technology that we building its you know you know a bunch of web Tools Mobile to you know automating work clothes for people and things like that
 can you talk through some of the internal tooling that your building and what your will you will you have to support
 I think one of the main tools were building is a
 dashboards tracking all the data about our developers so if you if you kind of think about I'll pop line right from the recruitment to the boot came to the initial phase of learning to apprenticeship like we have colors like a bunch of matter that are about to try and you know what I we can make informed decisions and even during the boot camp like all the assessments all those things are like we need to try and all those things in it built pools in place in the oven in order to track all those things on top of technologies that will be
 I read your blog post about migrating from a monolith to microservices we've talked through this migration process of a bunch of times on top Richard Daley fight don't know if we talked about boot camps or moving from a monolith to microservices more often but there are two Polar Opposites there two different things that have no barely been discussing the same show what are you explain what was the monolith and what was the process of breaking it into my car services just cuz I always like to hear different people talking through this architectural process it seems like quite a pattern that's common these days
 Wright's tomsula tomorrow is was around so we had actually we had a couple of monitors really so we had one system like I mentioned once Sentra dashboard tracking all the data about developers then we had another system tracking or for assessments and things like that and we had a bunch of other systems like an isolated send that kind of we're responsible for a single
 basis function but we realize was that a lot of the data into systems was replicated or at least it needed to be shared across all of those things so especially as
 our especially in the way we work it's kind of like a workflow where from recruitment it's kind of like that pipe line that goes from recruitment through when developer gets placed on the client engagement so you need to work in that same area where out all week we needed to have that affluent from all of this different systems in the uniform wear so it just made sense as I pointed to break apart all this man let's and kind of create a
 single by phone microservices architecture where we can have all this Independent Business unit started providing functionality two different apps and I can be skilled independently and that's kind of how we started to buy crates are monoliths to my purse services
 so that brings up the question does undella at 10 to build and sell its own software products at some point
 potentially potentially I think we are we are doing a lot of things in a lot of unique things especially interval training science side and building tools to support us in the way we practice learning and things like that so potentially once we can get it to work well enough for us internally other people who is the model of you build one product that is kind of well well-defined something like Amazon selling books or Tesla selling cars and then over time the process of whatever your building
 evolves into a product of its own so so we'll Adela selling Engineers I don't know if that's the way you want it's kind of like in overtime Amazon AWS just kind of coincidental I got like pay you know we realized we're really good at selling books because we are connected at this thing this well so why don't we just basically sell the infrastructure and then the same thing is kind of going on with Tesla where they're saying now hey what we're really good at is building these electric things and overtime the gigafactory is going to be the product that's what actually what we're going to be stats the main product to be focused on cuz it's it's kind of this barebones infrastructure of something that makes something else and simultaneously I can see on Della just because of a very unique urn of people passing through on Della system if the system itself as well architected maybe there is
 ancillary product that will fall out of a well engineered system where the system essentially brings in people and outputs great engineering Talent I'm sure there's going to be something interesting that it comes out of that way if it's well-engineered absolutely absolutely we're definitely doing a lot of things in the learning Sciences how would try running for people how we you know incentivize people to learn and all those things how how how we get people to work in a distributor fashion more efficiently so so yeah in the future and I think potentially we can have products coming out of you know solving problems in the distributed work environment or the learning work environment
 I want to watch something about Africa how does the usage of computer technology in Africa differ from North America
 is usage of computer technology I think in Africa have had the most experience in West Africa in East Africa because we operate in Nigeria and Kenya but I think in general Africa is very mobile and there's a lot of you know T-Mobile primary we have people access online content and
 butts
 a lot of people are also using no laptops and your your sign to see a lot of people like using mobile rather wearable Computing like apple watches Android Wear and all those things
 two people talk about Africa doing this leapfrogging thing where nobody well people don't care about the desktop as much as you get your smartphone if that does the trick for you or if you don't want to buy a desktop or laptop you just don't buy it this this lead to any interesting differences in how people live their lives as if if your main computer is your smartphone rather than you know I think of the way I live my life I can't use my smartphone throughout the day but the laptop or if my desktop is really my Hub and I'm kind of like not doing any intensive stuff on my phone I'm just kind of like you know I'm going to save that complex email him and have to write him and save it for later I'm not going to do it on my phone went to wait till I get home what kinds of things do people do differently because the smartphone is the primary computer
 a lot of people for example in Nigeria use the mobile phone to access online content so social media you know articles and all of that and a lot of people kind of just use to text up on work and throbbing after workout throughout the day or mostly on their mobile phones and accessing online content that way and if you think about also you no internet access no not a lot of people have I can swim in it outside of work where you know if they have the infrastructure and you know the money to set up internet and so a lot of people end up using you know their mobile devices to access online content and they also kind of have those little portable WiFi hotspots
 how to carry around to access the internet as well
 what are the other tech companies in Africa that are inspiring to you
 authors I think one side company that is inspiring to me is Conga and it's one of the largest if not the largest e-commerce site on Kearney Nigeria and I think they are very inspiring in terms of how they are you know normally just
 cannabis replicating you know something that's working in the west like you know Amazon coming out to eat using that ever became that here but they're actually using technology to improve like the user experience and improve the note the quality of your product and the are you know using in a cutting-edge Technologies like no Progressive web apps to make the mobile experience better and things like that considering the limited connectivity that people have in Africa. So I think it's probably one of the tech companies that I admire
 I did an interview about a year ago with these two brothers from Africa of Cena and on a Seiki on a CMA and they educate introduce me to the people from Montello who got me in touch with you which I appreciate and over time I've become friends with these two brothers their teenagers they built crocodile browser encouraging but to check out crocodile browser if you're looking for interesting browser and what is struck me the number of things struck me about the conversation that I had the interview I did with Oceania and Anna see what they was just that they were so similar in so similar to me in terms of the content that they were consuming because they were there software Engineers they're interested in tech there just an entrepreneurship it was basically like I was talking to somebody and Silicon Valley and I I couldn't notice
 any striking cultural differences or or anything it was just very interesting moment for me that was sort of like at this feeling of globalization you feel warm and fuzzy butt what what are the what are the ways in which African Engineers are different than American Engineers are there or the Striking differences or like are there not many differences
 I think I think it depends I think it depends on how much exposure the African Engineers have had so I take a lot of a lot of the engineers I like tech companies because they are really interested in technology and just software craftsmanship so they expose themselves to how things are done elsewhere and how we know the best companies are doing things so they are following blogs for a podcast and and in all those things but they don't really have that exposure no are no different and you probably wouldn't be able to read it to them as much for example you know you see some Engineers that I've never used it off as well
 two years ago and kind of worried like you know sharing there could be snow using drives and things like that so I think that's
 one thing where Angela is trying to kind of change that that space and or helping change. Space where we're trying to provide our developers that exposure into you know what other companies are doing what other technology companies are doing so that they can bring that back here in 2D African Tech ecosystem and you know * you know of course she the whole Space
 what are the problems in Africa that you think will be solved by technology in the near future
 I spank
 essay in
 in the country like Nigeria are saying
 public transportation system by technology I think the traffic issues will be solved by technology I think
 yeah I think will be solved by technology issues like gender gender equality or is kind of stuff
 you got improved by
 social network sir
 my social networks perhaps I think I think I think it probably more improve as we start seeing more you know female founder is my female Tech Founders in like being more females being interested in Technologies and like you know joining software engineers and like taking positions are driving to companies in Africa leader in making that happen obviously
 so what about the internet infrastructure in Africa how how good is it and what do you think of these efforts to improve it like I think Google's got something Facebook with the free Basics stuff what do you think of these efforts I think
 I honestly I think the internet connectivity is is actually not that bad I think I remember the first time that I when I when I move back to Africa and came to Nigeria I knew she had those thoughts like how's the internet connectivity here but like in the office like the internet connectivity is very strong we have no fiber optic and even though the MiFi and like the hot spots that people have are like really good and has a I think the message is very expensive to set up or I like to acquire so I think
 all those initiatives are would be really helpful in order to have a broader set of people access to Internet when it's you no more it's more than what weight because more commodity like the same way it is in in the US for example
 yeah that is exactly how I feel that's why I try to report on this free Basics stuff some particularly when that the India stuff happened in p.m. and I guess free Basics was kind of like voted against or something like that and I just didn't understand at all because like even if even if you have this internet service that maybe it's like not entirely neutral who who would vote against better internet connectivity is just so it's saying to me yeah that was just so insane to me anyway because of the people who are voting against the ones who had good internet as I understood LOL
 yeah so anyway what's you know where we're wrapping up near the end of our time have any companies copied on Della have there been any copycats or maybe similar businesses that are sprouted up in Africa doing some more thing cuz obviously you know either so many applications there's no way that you can get the entire fire hose of talent that's coming your way
 I believe in Nigeria has been one that's doing something similar but I think that in the major Tech hubs not like Nigeria Kenya and South Africa there are similar things like the same thing but that's a lot of companies that are you know trying to develop like that talent and get people to be interested in technology and software developer in general
 what's in the future for Adela what have we not touched on
 that's an interesting question
 I think I think in the future of undella I think it's too
 to get a larger footprints on the African continent I think and really gets more and more people to apply to the program and join the program go through program I think that's kind of like in the immediate future I say in the really long featured a 10 years from now I think what we really want is like you know all of these really talented people to now you know go back into any of the African Tech ecosystem and kind of like reduce ripple effect of
 just really really great technology companies out of the way to get created and solving all of the problems in Africa and just no improving the lives of everyone
 yeah and he was scaling when I talk to
 these boot camps it sounds like scaling is so hard because you need a lot of people to do be doing the training as well as this is like you know how many technology convict software companies are totally Basin software like that social network or something you just buy more servers and that's how you scale but if you're if you're not going to taste like on Della and you need to have people that are doing training need to have all these humans in the loop it's not as much of a straightforward equation so is that is that a kind of a bottleneck to scaling where you really need to have a really solid talent that in order to scale
 right so I think I think in the beginning we need to find these people to know if I sent it to learning of our developers and they have the experience obviously to be able to do that but I think we skill and as our own developers are becoming really really good and are advancing your level in your levels we can start seeing them supporting
 call focus on seeing our pipeline supporting software you have all of this great people that I've already gone through as soon as stage of the pipeline and they're like really good my experience and then have them come back in like support Mentor Arundel the learning of facilitation and all those things and kind of like you know
 I'm basically supporting yourself that way so that's kind of how we thinking about stealing
 yeah sure like the Y combinator fact for people who go through y combinator the number one thing that they want to do is go back to accommodate or somehow
 hi Bryce well this is been awesome conversation I am really intrigued by on Della and I hope to do more shows on it in the future thanks for coming on absolutely thank you for having me

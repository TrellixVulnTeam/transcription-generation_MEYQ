Transcription: Lenny Watson is an accessibility engineer and a director at the British computer Association of the blind to you wrote a blogpost called losing sight which is riveting and I'll be before we get to how you actually lost your sight I'd like to hear some about your experience as a web developer in the late 90s.com boom it was the best way to describe it everything felt during new I've been using that the web pretty much since it began since 93 94 and came to it as a Korea a little bit later in the 92 building websites we didn't have CSS
I told so you know it was a much more simple Wells than it is now suddenly you know possibility and people were talking about things that now you know I lost two to come to think about it but we seriously about virtual online Wells second life became a thing briefly and then disappeared again you know we had this amazing things play with and then that's kind of what I was doing see how do we how do we create new stuff how far can we push this and actually that's the spirit of the web but I don't think has been lost along the way I think that's still one of the brilliant things about the web-based development engineers and designers out there
how can we push this how can we do more how can we how can we move things differently shaped them in different ways to come up with something new and exciting and enough stuff so I turned 20 in 1994 so I was one of the first internet service providers in the UK company that was started up in 95 to provide internet services and I stopped on that tech support desk and somebody in their wisdom decided that they needed to open the tech support desk 24 hours in the morning was slightly optimistic so I got bored so I just started teaching myself how to code websites and fell in love with doing that the whole creativity and
in having an online presence yet from that really feel like a bubble around that time
 no I don't think it did it wasn't until Tina the crash came in and we'll kind of look back and switch we were running around like a bunch of kids having fun we made some mistakes I don't think it was really until then that we kind of realized that it was a bubble I guess you probably took it very different view of it you know that the extraordinary amounts of money that we were being thrown around in the early days if the the web you know probably send in retrospect where there any signs like cultural signs that that indicated a bubble like you know right now I'm wondering if you see any parallels
 parallels with now no no not at all right I think because the.com crash if I finish early 2000 is still in a pretty family entrenched in too many people's minds for it to have been forgotten so no I don't really kind of liking it to to the situation we're in now
 interesting do you think there's a there's a narrow like over conservatism where is like even to some people it looks like a bubble but maybe two others you know I don't know if your self is included in this but if you see it is more fundamental positive shift maybe there's underinvestment you think that's a possibility I think that was immediately after the end of the question in the early 2007 that was a very difficult to get any kind of businesses that I was working for a startup or I went to work first office in 2003 and they took great pains to present themselves very professionally in meetings you know they would turn up in suits and they're looking very businesslike if it's completely
 but it was this is because you know in society there was a bit of a reaction you know you guys on the way just running around in a playing City so it says we can't take you seriously you can't be trusted to run businesses you know you screwed it all up so there was this kind of soda reaction well well we almost had to become very serious too serious to start a business like appearance just a counteract that kind of somewhat mistrust I thinking in the industry of that time but that was a go away from that now and I think now we're in a pretty good space actually I think you know this there's a lot of confidence in in digital technology in the web but I think it's oh so temperate with experience in a pretty good position yeah I agree so against this backdrop of the.com Boom in 1999 you lost your eyesight due to die
 diabetes complications tell me about that morning in October 1999 when you woke up with a hangover and noticed a ribbon of blood in your line of sight will that morning in summer sex was quite unremarkable because I really just thought I'd bust a blood vessel in my eye because I've been out drinking the night before so it itself that morning as I say wasn't wasn't anything
 the Buckle at the time but looking back of course it's it's now the point I I realize that that was the first physical sign that there was something wrong with my site you don't have intercourse couple days later I took myself to to get my eyes checked out and and that led to animal consultations more medical investigations which ultimately 10. I had this beside condition cool diabetic retinopathy so yeah that was the start of the the Jenny I suppose what is diabetic retinopathy condition that happens
 to actually happens to a lot of diabetics diabetic for a very long time especially people who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes is a child type 1 means you have to inject insulin you can't control it with diet rule or tablets and in you caught up and finds that people who diagnoses as children when they get to old age experience difficulties with that size because of retinopathy but it happens to people like me who don't take care of their diabetes well enough so that accelerates the process when you don't control your diabetes probably one of the side effects is that your blood gets so congested with excess sugar
 about it sucks being able to send oxygen two important bits of your body and one of the bits of your body that's my sensitive to that lack of oxygen is the retina because it's tied by very very tiny blood vessels so they break down and nobody tries to compensate create new blood vessels in an effort to get the oxygen needed to that part of your body because the the blood vessels are created under emergency conditions if you like the week and they break I'm not sweating it to that the busted blood vessel that I could see that that morning in October that you just mentioned when somebody is diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy in such as in your case what are the acute measures that can be taken to try to fix things or reverse course type 1 diabetes
 the type you hear about on the news is known as type 2 and that's one that's often caused by people being overweight or you know environmental conditions A1 sauce or another and that can often be reversed or if not rivest pretty easily controlled through just to get healthy balanced diet and some tablet based medication type 1 diabetes is where I actually your pancreas the the organ in your body that produces the hormones that converts all the food you eat into usable energy are you hungry so she stops working stops producing insulin which is the whole9 you need and say you have to inject it yourself and older sisters of the regulates your buddies in a glucose level sites that I wanted some reversible but it is completely manageable
 an engine to manage it but there are millions of people around the world manage Diabetes Type 1 diabetes perfectly well there are also make mistakes in their lives so I mean tell me more about and you discuss the hotel in your in your blog post really really interesting I really encourage listeners to check it out but what was the transformation describe the transformation from the day where you wake up with that ribbon of blood in your line of sight and the day where you go to sleep with just a fragment of your site left and you wake up completely blind
 I would have took about a year people take a couple of weeks which in terms of losing your site over a period of time I'm supposed to be in it through an Abrupt text until something that's actually very quick
 time. So most most people who lose their sight over. Of time that happens over number he is supposed to be Vindicated cost at around I can put it like that in some respects
 was equally terrifying
 but will so it meant that I transitioned from set of one thing to the next so quickly
 that probably didn't have time to stop and think about quite how polling it was
 as much as I probably would have done had to take any longer so that's a pretty sounds strange but it's like tearing the Band-Aid off analogy that busted blood vessel in in the October Sorry by kind of the February of the following year it was quite apparent that I I couldn't see straight anymore and my stuff was pretty blood I couldn't work out details you know I'm things and I tried using magnification software on my computer is a piece of the size of text if it's in pieces by the may have to come a bit of them
 an impossible task in and then I stopped where I can listen to. And it was my birthday in the summer and stage of being able to see a few more things you know by that time I could I could see light and Shadow but not much else and then buy the solution at the Autumn that was pretty much diminishing truce the point in the December when I just answered if you remember me up to see the last kind of smudges of bright light sources on and not to disappear so you know everything's going to move from one stage to the next so quickly that yeah I almost didn't have time to stop and really consider each stage is it happened to actress Yeah you mentioned when you realize that you would be mine forever and you said I cried for my lost sight for all my Broken Dreams for my stupidity for all the books that I would never read for the faces I would forget and for all the things
 I would never accomplish how did you move beyond that state emotionally
 I am that's a very good question and there are probably different dances to it in in the first sentence I
 I went to the doctor and set up an account Coke you need to to help and then they put me on some anti-depressants me to sleep in 10 minutes in the morning to see my now-husband off to work and he's coming in the evening and still be sound asleep and that went on for several weeks before I decided that wasn't any sensible way to carry on the tree life and and stop taking them but but somewhere it sounds like a depressant not an antidepressant
 for six weeks of pretty much just been constantly asleep I think it just gave my brain time to process some of what was happening interesting so are you yes absolutely you know how to live like that long-term care about these is the types of antidepressant I hear about are more like they have some stimulant nature to them I cry a lot of times and I count myself lucky to be able to say this it's it's not a subject I know a great deal about it's the only time in my life I've I've ever taken them I have a unusual reaction to the mall I was prescribed something that you know
 and so beyond the the Tranquil tranquilizing antidepressant State once you got off of those what was your journey like
 fruit I think it's probably the showtimes said it was difficult for a number of reasons it's
 it's scary it's at there's no getting away from that you know she asked most people who was sighted at you know how they feel about losing their site that you know they'll tell you it scares them to death
 you have to learn how to do so much again you know you said I forget what it's like we we we never really remember what it's like to learn stuff as a kid you know what I remember
 how it was to learn to read to tie your shoelaces you know what things you should have to go back and learn how to do it again completely the chief I'm not a patient person in my friends tell me I have a good day so far what we call an Engen bloody-mindedness just to kind of Fina
 a determination to get on with life and I'm not served me well but it also means that that you know I would get I get very frustrated right across with myself and I felt like I couldn't learn how to do something again as quickly as efficiently as I wanted to and that was why you are mean you mentioned in in the in the kitchen and wash dishes and you just end up like breaking bunch of stuff done it's like that was about it but I just I just tripped I just stumbled in the kitchen and put my hand out on the sideboard and call the edge of the draining Rattle and literally just offended I don't know how many plates and dishes and stuff all have to Florida rain around him and just reaching out for help
 I'm just going to stay in the middle of the kitchen until you have to do that I could otherwise you cry a lot more than you
 yeah so okay but you're a computer person so like one of the things I'm really interested about is like you know computers are easy to operate and I mean well all things considered and how did you get from the point where you know you had trouble navigating the kitchen to the point where you can effectively you know have an influential computer job once again even without sight describe that training process that retraining it's slow you know I do
 I took my computer back out of the cupboard was going to come touch type ridiculous and it seems ridiculous to me then you know I'd never bother to learn how to touch type cuz I could always see the keyboard types of the screen radio screen into synthetic speech one of the things it does when he hit the key things that can process of just typing everything one character at a time and listening to screaming to make sure I got it right realize I got hit the wrong key cuz you know I didn't have the muscle memory so touched
 somewhere I gotta be quicker in a bit quicker
 a bit quicker and then suddenly you don't stop thinking about it
 like you do any fast lens to use the keyboard in the first place you know it's unfamiliar of Fest but at some point you look up and realize you haven't actually thought about how to type and you know how many weeks or months or days or whatever how does a screen reader work system
 sorry I get different screen or just the windows for the next iOS Android OS X and
 they're api's on
 operating system platforms
 does API is make information available about what sunscreen so you know I like a button or menu and she is just as characteristics about that sing in it with her has a text label you know how much screen tight space it takes up whole whole bunch of different characteristics you know what it is what it does what state it's in Brainerd is just take that information and most commonly translate into synthetic speech so you know if you see a button on the web page
 and I have a has a text label in it than the screen Rachel just announced the text label until you that it seems a submit button or so and that's pretty much how they how they work work flow with a screen reader compared to your workflow as a programmer when you had site
 hasn't changed that much I'm still pretty old school when it comes to coding I I just use a text Heather so I don't use any of the
 the more useful kind of IDs or anything like that at some point I think I probably tried decided that it was too much like Hardwick to try and overcome some of the accessibility challenges that those those applications that are presented out of that habit particularly so so little respect she hasn't changed some things take longer so it's it's harder to debug code now cause you called you that sort of visual skimming things so you know how you kind of got an inkling of where bug
 you know the root cause of a buck is and you can kind of see the fishy skin back through the code it just takes a bit longer to to read that code when you go to listen to it but you know I used to hear these stories from what I have heard these stories from the old school programmers where you have to write all your stuff in and put in Punch Cards and then it's like you only get one chance to run it and or well if you have to run it and then like it's really hard to debug it cuz it's like you're running it on a Mainframe or punch cards or whatever and so the stakes are raised so you have it causes them to be correct the first time a lot more just because they knew that was so much pain associated with having to go back and feed bucket
 I found you need a good memory it really helps to have a good memory you expect to find it you almost no chance of finding it again I kind of remember what you did with stuff and remembering how you something is that stuff that really does make a difference that she having a good memory is in the first place so
 HD says I don't I don't have much opportunity to to put a no other in the contract and most of what I do now is is working with organizations to help them fix accessibility problems in that code so I end up just need to take in chunks of code and refactoring them so that they are accessible to people I mean he's a screen reader and people with disabilities or just looking at kind of common design patents and sharing those with with good accessibility in to try and help develop as you know minimize the amount of what they need to do to make stuff accessible what is a common design pattern that is either an accessible or or a design pattern to refactor inaccessible code in an accessible engineering to accessibility
 one of things we come across at the moment
 I just ease into it a side project that I can watch him with some some friends we see a lot of tapped into faces and a lot of carousels load of accordions those kind of representations of content weather a multiple chunks of content but only one is displayed at a time and you won't be able to see to choose which one is displayed or cycle through each of the Ben 10
 and the QuietComfort in a complex interactions but they don't none of them really exist in HTML so there are no elements for tabs or at our cell so we create them using kind of dips in Spanish in themselves that we cool semantic elements so they don't come to make much information available to screen read is another assistive Technologies so he's a through H 6 in HTML and the brassell telescreen read that that's a heading I just found is no real kind of useful information it's just a kind of holding element is that makes sense so we have to try an ad in the accessibility manually we can do that with things at the Aria specification
 we're all having to do this as developers ourselves and every time you know developer tries to do they do it differently old they have to start from scratch and you know they're all these little complications that mean the whole process is quite error-prone so at least complex widgets on the web tend to be a bit of a challenge for accessibility both in terms of developing them and getting it right and actually using them with the technology like a screen reader
 so are there are you saying that there are certain elements on a web page where the screen reader basically can't describe that element accurately to a blind person I didn't spend actually a pretty much it so all other tables table head is table row headings is she holds a paragraph heading is heading image graphic understands what the information available to the accessibility ipi's I was talking about earlier so the screen is can can pick up on the information in it and use it but still stand fans are quiet deliberately neutral that I don't have a particular roller
 purpose of the rain
 which is why we use them to create a custom widget so much could you talk a little more about how a web page is converted to an audible format with the accessibility AP eyes when you load agents the browser
 brother does a lot of work actually on the user search United patients the browser browser creates document object model a hierarchical tree of all the content on the page for the whole bunch of that information from the dumb and creates an accessibility tree so it's the same hierarchical representational kind of different bits and pieces on the page but this time it just contains information that useful to assistive Technologies and then the screen reader comes along basically Cleary's accessibility tree to say okay what are we got here do we have in a bunch of plain text or is there images in their room in other links are the headings all the tables in all those kind of things I'm with that information
 play something to speech so as I move through a web page you know I get told when something is a heading or table or they made sure they each image has text description which is vital for my point of view contents to to describe the image to Amy browser picked up by the screen are you doing translated into speech that I can understand what are the types of organizations and companies do you work with to make their technology accessible
 lots of different sorts of organizations organizations large and small I work for a company at the moment so you know we working with us universities government departments in the tech space Google in another companies who want to know more about making that product accessible and and you know we can provide that help
 very interesting so
 what I mean when I want a developer loses sight and I don't know how many encountered
 is there like is there typically like a barrier of discrimination or Prejudice to 2 reclaiming the job post disability
 it's not something I've ever experienced her myself but I'm very well aware that it does happen yes I don't think it's anything in this unique to particularly I think it's just a very typical thing of society in general you know I've had too many people with all kinds of different disabilities not just the people who are blind say you know that they've been Morris would have dismissed from job interviews because you know someone somewhere has has basically said so yes it is a very real thing
 weather that's in a more prevalent in the technology industry I honestly don't know I do know a lot of developers and technologists of of one sort or another so I know for sure we got some really good ambassadors really good leaders in a real way that it's absolutely not the case that someone with a disability, do these trips but I suspect you discrimination head to
 how high is the rise of smartphones affected what it's like to be blind and what it's like to be a blind technologist
 they made it an extraordinary different sexually
 I am not use mine
 the same things that everybody else does unit social media email even occasionally have fun cool but what's amazing of how about these other two devices is that they 40 Louis area of getting assistive Technologies is an extraordinary and / devices now, the screen reader built-in for free
 now you have to acknowledge that Tina Apple devices on the cheapest devices out there but the fact that this technology is available as positive of the thing that you buy and you know they've they've taken great steps to make sure as far as they can that you know apps need to bounce and stuff for that device is a pretty accessible it's it this a free screen reader that's available for Android devices on day 2 of put in a little black making sure that you know the software to use for creating a bounce house in a pretty good accessibility device in a call she baked chicken
 Soul Surfer interview if they change things a great deal but also in terms of that will tell me what kind of pay for money here in the UK money is different it's all different sizes so you know this is a different size note to you guys in the states
 want to go to all the bills and it'll tell me
 tell me you know which denomination notice I put an app that tells me what color things are I have it she went back all the time so this one isn't so much of a useful thing to me but you know but nice just to know what color something is that you're looking at my my phone will do that I couldn't app that will let me take a picture of something likes a menu in a restaurant and it will convert that picture of text into plane text and then the screen reader on my phone can just speak it to me so you know it's not possible for me to sit in a restaurant and
 in a text picture menu and actually read it for myself so it's open. It's amazing how to use that before worry they expensive to accomplish impossible to accomplish or just too cumbersome to do you know in in in the context you know you will go this now on your little device you can stick in your pocket
 Ontario around with um for the most part you know these apps
 discussed in a cup liquid and some of the more expensive but but you know the cost is considerably less than that the old analog equivalent
 what about diabetes monitoring are there tools for smartphone that have help with that in general yes the real irony in oras
 the above is that I have yet to find a really accessible diabetes monitoring app to identify globally but sitting in in a little developed countries is usually one of the top three causes of blindness
 you kind of think this is a primary condition that causes secondary condition and yet the tools that you get still I have a tracking device in it sad that I can do that way but that device is also capable of being plugged into my computer so I can do interesting things with the test results on my computer
 and I just look for it you know and I'll listen Titans and the rest of it without software isn't accessible design for blind people but then I forgot about it really is that you prick your finger and the dongle communicates with the phone and then you have the diabetes monitoring stuff just all in your phone I suspect that the property of projects in in the US you have a lot more Technologies available to dive Essex UK I don't know if it's because I said of medical review process is over here
 stringent I doubt it but maybe budgetary I I don't know but we also use different mechanisms full measuring blood glucose levels in the US and the UK so I can't even come over to the states and I know from reading on how can you use recently open source projects and I'm thinking about these things so I'm hopeful that somebody will figure it out soon and hopefully with no power to the make an awful lot of money for themselves and each other it's a good thing to do for business
 did to get a better picture of the narrative Arc of your story how did you end up working on it set accessibility software I mean it's certainly understandable route to have taken after that but I'm just curious what was the series of events that led to you work on accessibility software it actually happened by accident which was surprises people because the logical completion is his unit because I lost my sight I developed an interest in and making things more accessible and then went to work to do something about it but it wasn't that organized I'm afraid to bite somewhere not long after I started to use my computer again
 I had joined an email list for people who use the the screen reader that I I do most often and one day somebody posted an email this would have been really 2002 I think this person is a new company website and the clients didn't have budgets to test the website with people with different disabilities but when they build the website they tried very hard to follow accessibility guidelines for the w3c
 play welcome any feedback from screen refuses to to tell them how they they they had gone on whether they were things they could do to improve it and so I I thought well you know I used to be a web developer I definitely know a screen reader to use this type of hops I can I can help
 so I went to look at this website in line. I sent an email to two hours with some feedback and we go to okay it was just $0.25 miles away from where I left at the time so I started just doing occasional Pizza Hut Fulton Mina reviewing websites and writing reports full them and eventually became a full-time employee of has found its 8003 employee between up at 6 I think in the company and when I left a couple of years ago they were well on my way to heading past 60 people
 Anna Anna Anna where to get business 10 of us so I had stayed with them you know if 11 or 2 years of Transitions and it just so happened that unit accessibility was a big positive of what company was about that's in the usability so yes it was nothing will not ready
 interesting and then after since then you just been doing kind of consultative work or yes yes pretty much I mean did did did the company I was just mentioning in a consultancy was a large part of that that business to some extent of mine. Up until the current day but now the company I what Chris said group is the first time I've seen quite a long time I'm actually ready to get back into the
 you know the details of how things are built and how they work and how they can be made to look that's up which is nice so I'm enjoying it so if there's a listener out there right now you're building something a web web developer what are there are there libraries or tools or best practices that that developer can use to improve accessibility yes sir. Sir thinking about sort of which it component libraries jQuery UI has some pretty good accessibility
 section to it you need to keep a little bit of caution when it comes to that the JavaScript Frameworks like I can get Amber and react they tend to have pretty poor accessibility by default but there's a growing community of people working on improving that there are some good tools available for all three of those are Frameworks I just mentioned the ramp and packages for accessibility testing tools that you can you can factor into a building varmints to help kalafina run some checks and point you in the right direction of things that might need fixing
 the guidelines the web content accessibility guidelines from the w3c and they provide soda fetty broad-brush you need to think about making sure people can use your website without a mouse make sure that he content in the things your building like a lot of accessibility actually most of this advice is just really good advice so comfortable to read is it's just common sense if you got something important on your website you know I'm preaching to be you think it's important because you put it on the way out there's no point in making it, too difficult for people to read search the web content accessibility guidelines and techniques on a whole bunch of different things you can do
 my bottle or nature. But it's some it's a good place to start feeling that you know there are countless blogs on places to go for information at the w3c has an email list w a i i g 4900 people he was very interested in accessibility.
 We can ask questions that is a guitar and slack Channel which is also Flex into IRC
 which is going to the couple hundred very technically minded accessibility people hanging out the ass so you know it's a great place to develop his two to come and hang out as questions I spend a lot of time talking and chatting with lots of people looks like a Dame has a lot of great accessibility information for tpg repost regularly on a Blog stuff out there
 did you keep track of the types of innovations that
 people try working on to fix this type of to fix your type of condition like a to fix diabetic retinopathy that's some sort of brain to computer interface or stem cell for eyes interesting what going on in in two different areas you mentioned stem cell research that's definitely one one area of research that has possibilities in terms of
 I'll be able to trade in my case to regrow my at my retinas which have have long since disappeared
 April 2nd of absent I'm actually being able to replenish Allure grow people who lost their crops to an accidental something at the moment I think I'm rather more helpful at the technology side of things but then so there's a lot of research being done in two
 technologies that will let you wear a camera on a pair of glasses and they will then transmits signals to a chip that will be implanted in your brain probably somewhere around the optic nerves send signals that you be able to receive trials with this way they've managed to do this quite successfully in a very very crude and basic way so we just talking you know tens of tens of pixels wide by Hisense implanted in their brain to try that again some pretty successful Trials of the reservation just in the years that I've been keeping an eye on this
 the resolution of what's possible in that regard seems to have improved in there still a lot of challenges in the long way to go but but yep you know that this already said a positive research being done in the area well is the interface between the brain and computers understood that a given that we seem to understand relatively little brown stuff but yeah you know what they say if if we humans ever stop to think about what we were doing a lot of the time we probably wouldn't make off the progress that we do so you know I don't know I think this that's some amazing possibilities on me you know I know this research being done into the ability to control technology just using your mind
 again some really significant steps have you made that I would just an extraordinary for people with physical disabilities. To see this now in a little bit of prosthetic limb development where you know that there are able to slip into the muscles and so you can actually control chicken for example in roughly the same way that you would control an actual hand but you know just thinking that you want to move and pick something up
 I'll make some gesture so we're doing a little research in the load of any kind of medical field without enough or pretty enough but it is new and interesting as the gaming industry is quite likely to have tried it first and more often than actually we can look to a lot of Medical Solutions from from those kind of Industries
 I have heard some interesting things about you know the cross section of research and gaming what what do you see there are some interesting things so I can write about some research that Disney was doing about a year ago into it with a cold it was basically using to provide tactile feedback the gaming so Pastaria cuz you miss the shop just using you know shop puffs of an you know other strengths and blasts she like can you know that's that's quite interesting possibilities from from an accessibility point of view if you can just kind of create the impression
 in a physicality
 and it going to have to convince someone in as-is organic Bulls just come whistling past 3 you know what you could do to try and help people who can't see and environment understand what's around them for example weiner creation new interface is old or new ways of getting responses out of our system so starting on the web sites and a Michaels the sound effects but that's no good if you can't hear the sound effects of the button might look like it's been pressed that's no good if you can't see that is being pressed soap using these kind of different interaction modes be in a high-pressure air you know vibration tactile feedback of one source for another kind of origins in the gaming industry
 I'm at the house have interesting possibilities for the ways people interact with kind of the weapon technology on a daily basis I think
 fascinating so I guess I'd like to be in the clothes off do you have any recommendations for like reading material for for our listeners like to either two things that have helped with your journey since Contracting diabetic retinopathy or just things that help with empathy for accessibility people who need accessibility Jenny any kind of resources that you think will be useful
 resource is a difficult to suggest the poly because I suppose I never really had to look for resources on a house instead of empathize because it was me that was going through the whole thing
 if I get off of one piece of advice would be
 trying to sweat it too much I have people and it will be talking in and they'll send me say you know I'm sorry I didn't see it but I watched it I still say you know I I I read that book it did I mean and then people get very worried about
 accidentally offending or or upsetting someone who has a disability and I'm sure you got some people with disabilities offended no matter what you say you get grumpy people get offended anyway that's what most of us you know what if you mean you mean the right thing with not enough to to know you meant the right thing we're not going to get tangled up on you know language and things like that so
 just get on with it just just talk to people use the language you would normally use you know are there any other projects that you're working on currently being mentioned
 but I do love what with the w3c so I work a lot of things like the HTML specification Aria pieces of that takes a lot of my time of just become one full coach as responsible for the web platform working group responsible full specs like HTML and I don't keep my LG model linen a whole bunch of other stuff so I don't think a lot of side project it's taking up a lot of time I'm pretty interested in SVG and accessibility the moments
 how to different people than you thinking about their self doesn't have
 a lot of accessibility so like I was saying that you know the Browns and knows what most HTML elements to and accessibility sense are we already have that in SVG at the moment it's coming in in ac2
 the right now if you put some some SVG you know into a browser
 browser doesn't really make any accessibility information available Source Creamery just kind of just look at it and go so we're looking at getting a cg2 more accessible natively but what I'm looking at at the moment with his friend is how we can use technology like Aria to add some of that accessibility information into SVG in the same way we used to do the same for HTML for a while now because so many variables this SVG itself different browsers different screen readers different techniques for the padding in the accessibility so
 add scratching satisfyingly head-scratching project to the moment
 well leonie Watson thanks for coming out of software engineering daily it's been really interesting talking to you very welcome it's been a lot of fun thank you for asking me

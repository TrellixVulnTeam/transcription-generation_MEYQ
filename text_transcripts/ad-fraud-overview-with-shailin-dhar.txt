Transcription: the internet runs on Advertising advertising is subject to fraud but then again so is every system of online transactions the amount of money lost in electronic payments fraud and e-commerce scamming is probably much greater than what is lost due to advertising fraud so why do we keep covering advertising fraud on software engineering daily well more of our audience needs to know about advertising fraud do people realize how much fraud there is an online advertising in previous episodes of software engineering daily we have explained how advertising Works how they advertising fraud system works why it's absurd disgraceful and why nobody talks about advertising fraud we also cover advertising fraud because I find it interesting and sometimes hilarious myself
these are the same reasons that I invited shawland are to speak at the third software engineering daily meet up Sean has been on the show twice before and he will be on again in the future he's made it a full-time job to expose add fraud and discuss it and he gives a great presentation on the topic in this episode he presented this at the third meet up and it was great because he discussed some of the things that he witnessed as in early on he was he was kind of a black hat his one of his earliest experiences in the advertising fraud space was doing this advertising fraud and he talks about the open like it so he's in the space and he stumbled into it's not like he initially be a fraudster but this is this is what a lot of people in the ad fraud space are doing is they stumble into it and they realize all of a sudden that they're working at a company that is committing advertising fraud because there's basically no risk for
Engineers who work at these places certainly a lot less risky to do fraud in advertising than it is to do fraud in something like the stock exchange but it can be just as lucrative and in this episode Shaolin Dodge into that a little bit so I hope you enjoy it

 everybody my name is Jalen I am in add fraud researcher and consultant and basically my time gets spent researching how add fraud is done and figure out ways for ad-tech companies to prevent becoming victims of it so fraud is not something new to any business but fraud and advertising particularly is very interesting so brought in any industry any realm lives in the shadows it doesn't make itself known and that's one thing with fraud counting fraud estimates fraud detection is it's actively doing everything I can to not be detected and not be counted and fraud when you speak to people that actually commit at frog none of them will be wearing their black hoodies and the basement and be typing on computers they are people with families they live in Suburbia they just look like perfectly normal people and you would never guess that they were in the
 and I tried it always starts out the justification is it's more of a means to an end rather than I am starting out on this fragile path I guess the way you can look at it is starting out shoplifting by stealing a pack of gum cuz you don't have any change on you and if that becomes a habit that you constantly shoplift then you become a thief but in that one in that's how they always get on this path is this is easy money I can do it from home and eventually they build businesses out of it so my focus now is advertising fraud happened by random series of events I studied economics I went to work for an investment Bank straight out of school ended up in advertising fraud the reason I think I ever tizing fraud is important is because advertising fuels a lot of our global economy consumer culture is built on advertising and as long as fraud in any Industries part of the fringes kind of stays okay
 but when it becomes part of the mainstream Foundation of any industry like we saw with the financial crash that's when we start causing problems so with any type of media there was always audits newspapers magazines Billboards radio ads tv ads there were physical ways to count the production of those media type so you could count the number of newspapers printed you count the number of magazines printed where Billboards were and that started to change with this thing called the internet where everybody had computers and it could be done digitally so the trajectory in advertising was right now we look at our computers were being faster with ads everywhere we're Focus now is how do we reach the right people at the right time before it was everybody's watching TV at 6 p.m. how do we send them the right message that's what gave rides to ad agencies and I don't know if anybody here is watch Mad Men but that was the Bay
 cuz the only thing they had up against their competition as an Advertiser was the creative that you were using the story that you were telling the commercial that you made the magazine that you made whatever that was so then would digital the supply and demand kind of got screwed up because you could create infinite Supply without any real overhead cost with newspapers are Billboards you physically had to go print a million extra issues of a newspaper to sell that much more advertising and with computers it was some server has to log a million extra clicks and that's all it really took to sell more advertising so that started with the cost per click model then we transition to What's called the CPM model and CPM is cost per mil so I'll ever tizing is sold on a cost per meal which is cost per thousand adds to every thousand dad's has a rate of what's a young the modern Market it's around $5 so every thousand ads cost $5
 of course you pay individually for every thousand so it'd be $0.05 by 10% per actual individual add and so with digital advertising you saw the original media publishers online like CNET and download.com AOL those cpi-m's were $100 or higher because you were buying the same way that you were buying print media now you have cpi-m's that are half a cent $0.01 CPM and advertisers and agencies have jumped on it because they look at it as cheap media I'm taking my eyeballs with but it's actually just fake robotic visitors to sights or no actual humans go and the reason that this whole traffic Mark and you can go out on the internet and look up buying web traffic and buy anything you want you can buy it based on time you can buy based on the number of visits and that started because everybody
 started creating their own blogs and now everybody had their own web properties the only logical Next Step was how do we put ads on there because we want to reach people wherever they are on the internet the advertising industry gave these people an opportunity to sell that had space and sell those eyeballs and now that those small sites had an Avenue to sell the ad space they wanted an Avenue to also get more traffic and nobody really question where the traffic was coming from so the transition between these big media properties like New York Times or Huffington Post was they used to get deals with agencies on what's called to fix deal so you have 2 million users every month we want to buy 10 million at Impressions this month for this fixed price and it's legitimate direct contract between the agency in the web publisher then that's what was based on demographic so you would buy ad space on the New York Times
 Financial page or the Washington Post sports page to focus on the type of demographic that visited that part of the site transition from that to what's called psychographics was targeting people wherever they are in the internet based on their behavior so cookies based on the cookies that you have now in your profile they could assume that you were this type of person interested in these types of products and so they could Target you with a specific type of that and that's what gave rise to what's called programmatic advertising and programmatic advertising is done through what's called at exchanges and you could basically put in a campaign and instead of saying I want to buy this website you say I want to buy these users and these cookie profiles I'm willing to pay this much CPN and I want to buy them from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. it was basically just buying users instead of buying websites now and so if you go into
 how does traffic modelworks this is all a fraudulent publisher really needs to work out their business model how much am I paying per click and how much money am I making on the ad space so the CPN in this example is $2.50 the ads on the page there's for ads on a page divided by 1000 and you break even at $0.01 cost per click and so if you can buy traffic at $0.01 per click you can break even on this model and we'll get to later side where you can see there's lots of sub Penny traffic available so this is how it's called rtb auction Works real-time bidding it's a hundred 250 ml seconds that's how ads are sold online yeah does not actually sold until you're loading the webpage and it's a second price auction so the highest bidder wins but they pay the price that the second highest bidder was willing to pay that's the way the options are set up so
 information gets passed from the browser to The Exchange and then bitters Cummins play and this example bitter for has the highest bid but they get price down to $2.52 because that's the second highest bid so the thing that makes everything easy to understand within advertising fraud is the financial incentives at each piece has so if you look at Publishers Webb property their financial incentive is to sells much advertising space as possible advertisers want to derive the maximum value from their advertising dollars weather that's tails with e-commerce or just brand awareness like Coca-Cola agency model for decades now has been our client gives us a million dollars to spend on media we charge a 10% management fee and so we take $100,000 but we only make 10% of everything that we spend so there was never an incentive to spend less or spend safely you didn't make your mom
 unless you spent everything that the client gave you and that's just not with the agency even back to the CMO level at a brand they never wanted to spend less money in a year because that meant the next year they would get a small budget so there's always is push to spend spend spend spend in online advertising at tech companies which are the basically the pipes that allow the serving of lads they make their money on servings of impression so they make their money on the quantity of that Impressions rather than the quality of a depression so if you have 10 million impressions at a $0.10 CPM or you have 1 million impressions at a dollar CPN the advertisers paying the same amount but the ad tech companies are making way more money then there's a spot detection companies which also rose with the awareness of Bot traffic online so Advertiser started paying attention companies to make sure their ads were not being served two Bots
 these are the financial models of the pieces in the industry

 this is a screenshot of my conversation with a company called easy manga and so this is the sales person from his anger telling me you can buy I ask filter traffic at 7:10 to the scent forensic filter traffic at 6:10 service at and all these filters are bot detection companies so they started selling traffic that was designed to pass spot detection filters so now you have this arms race of people trying to connect the box and people creating traffic that purposely goes around those filters and you can see in that basic model we broke broke even at $0.01 cost per click and this is sold at less than $0.02 per click this is a company called hitleap based in Hong Kong and they sell traffic on a Time basis so you can buy 10000 minutes of traffic for $9 you can buy 1 million minutes of traffic for 600
 it is not hard to spin up a profitable web property with lots and lots of visitors this is a very basic lot browser but you can see that it's going through the different sites that it's going to be visiting or referring from so that the website is visiting is up. V in and you could see it goes through all the referral site to change browser agent and changes its IP address just on the flight so it looks very random then there's a company called diabolic labs and their literal slogan on their website is software for Devil's that's where that's where those tears upon their slogan is software for Devil's you download the software and now you can create but traffic from your computer to visit whatever size you want and diabolic Labs actually sells you can do you to visit SoundCloud plays and basic just web browsing
 these are like the two basic bot detection methodologies is your either assuming everybody visiting the site is a human and you are going to try to prove that there are bought or you assume everybody is a bought and you're going to try to prove that there's a human so those are the two basic methodologies and depending on the company the traffic vendors use that to figure out how to bypass them this is a screenshot from a box section company called perimeter X this is a very basic illustration of how somebody reverse Engineers about the section filter base and many sources of traffic to the filter they see what comes out clean on the other end and then they only sell that traffic as I ask filter or no filter or whatever filter and it doesn't cost them very much the way they do this is they actually sign up for accounts with the bot detection companies as a website and then they'll say I'm publisher I want to scan my traffic and out they have direct
 data from these boxed action companies and shows them what's passing what's not and this is a very tough problem for about 2 Section company so because you have a sales team that's pushing and pushing and trying to find new clients to sign up for the service and they are incentivize to sign up everybody that comes knocking and then you have an engineering team who's scrambling to figure out how they're constantly being reverse-engineer and it's by their own customers
 tried again normally lives in the fringes would I prod visit screenshots from LinkedIn of people selling is filter traffic and other types of traffic that you can monetize bees go home search on LinkedIn you find it wherever you want you can buy shopping traffic for eCommerce sites it's all available so obviously this was not an easy pill to swallow for most people in at Tech or the advertising industry so I got called to wire a fear Monger all these types of things so I said alright I'm just going to go prove it to you so I created a site called East 11 news I bought it on GoDaddy for like 899 and I spent it up and that's the screenshot from the site you celeb news
 what I did was went out found a traffic vendor for LinkedIn
 one tenth of a cent per click and you see the menu here is
 so filter is filter mode filter forensic yes or no and it's just a drop down menu of what you want this traffic to do so then I picked my target which was an ad platform that said we guarantee hundred percent fraud free so I said okay you're basing this on interval add science which is a widely about the filter and because they're so widely adopted across the advertising industry their target for the traffic vendors because that's where they have an incentive great the traffic for I hosted on GoDaddy yet $8 months Linux hosting so that was the one tenth of a cent for click traffic you can see my user ID and So based on the date the number of clicks I bought and how much I spent and below is the Google analytics screenshot you conceive it
 96% or 98% of these visitors are new users that's a huge red flag with any website is the overwhelming majority there traffic is new users instead of returning desserts that should be some type of balance otherwise you're what is referred to as an Arbor trash site
 this is screenshots from Google analytics also the breakdown of the service provider so who's the internet connection all Cloud hosting companies and the browser break down which is anomalous to the general computer user Market
 the thing is it doesn't have to use Firefox you just passing something else so I monetize this site and I had four different companies for different bot detection companies scanning what the quality the traffic was bad because I was buying mote filter traffic is bizarre traffic doubleverify filter traffic is Major filters I picked two that were the major filters that were the targets of the traffic and to agnostic ones that were smaller companies what was one of the big ones and this is a hundred percent robotic Data Center Traffic they detected 38% thoughts
 Oxford by econometrics is a much smaller company they're obviously not a target of the top of the traffic vendors they detected 90% Bots and integral ad science which is the biggest spot detection company in the ad space they detected 17% thoughts and this is one tenth of a cent per click Datacenter traffic and so the question is how big is if detection is not very accurate how big is I'd really and so you can go through the advertising industry and see all the different estimates so the IB did a study with our young and they said 8.2 billion dollars a year is lost ad for at the AMA which is the association of national advertisers the big brands that do advertising their trade group and white Ops which is about section company they said 7.2 billion dollars is lost a driver yes
 graphic card free state of fraud detection companies are also tries on and if they're selling the claim that they can text products they're not even
 I think as far as they know they're detecting fraud that's the whole issue now they're not purposely not detecting it
 now did you I've tried to explain this it's hard for any of moat actually one of the companies that I wrote about in this report came to me and said okay help us improve and so what we did was went out and said okay we're going to buy milk filter traffic on the market send it to them and see what they can learn to help improve their filter rather than waiting to see what happens in the market actually study it and isolated environment and see how the traffic is behaving so different companies have different responses to this
 I would say 25% yeah the WFAA which is the World Federation of advertisers I'm biased towards this report because I was but our estimate was 30% that 30% of web traffic is fraudulent an invalid now why are these I'm sorry go ahead
 cash Arbitrage definition
 so they say the revenue relies on been buying traffic so they buy on a cost per click they sell on a Prosper Mill and they have to make sure that balances out where they make a profit so Darren this constant profit margin game so the reason at all these estimates are so different is the way that these estimates are done so you have one sample of traffic nobody scanning the entire Market they're taking one sample of traffic there taking one detection method and then they extrapolate that to the entire industry and so you have a 8.27 point too and we'll get to where this money goes easy misconception is all of that is going to quote unquote fraudsters but in reality it's going to everybody that makes money on human trafficked as well so the money changes hands the same for fraudulent web traffic as it does
 human web traffic and the ivy which is the interactive advertising Bureau did a study with price Waterhouse Cooper where they said 55% of programmatic advertising budgets go to all the technology layers in between and so if you're wondering why nothing is being done very seriously about an 8.2 billion-dollar problem every year it's because 55% of the money goes to the White Collar companies that actually serve the ads and so you know this is a little bit tongue-in-cheek but it's a very real thing is you look at the 3.9 billion dollars a year is fueling legitimate add tech companies IBS mimitate 4.5% company call dad looks came out with the report this year that said 12.5 billion every year that means 6.8 billion is going to legitimate site companies and then there's a company here in San Francisco distil networks that their estimate was 18.5 billion and that would mean
 .1 billion is going to add tech companies every year if all that money disappears a lot of these companies disappear and so because these companies are incentivize down the volume in the quantity there's not a lot of movement on getting rid of it it all comes down to cleaning up the supply chain and you can see why certain companies would be resistant to that because they know that's a big part of their revenue model so this is the only illustration I can find that really makes sense of this whole thing is we keep talking about fraudsters and fraudsters and hackers but it's actually the executives when they're not take that are benefiting the most because these technology layers for serving the ads make most of the money and advertisers control the ecosystem but they don't really know what to do there being told one thing by the press one thing by their agencies or agencies like don't worry about it it's all good we had this problem
 handled we have this filter in place and it's telling us that fraud is 2% and if you talk to these bot detection companies and this is one of the most insane things that I've seen is agencies will do What's called the Bake-Off and so they say okay we're going to audition by detection vendors we're going to have you guys 3/4 companies where have you scan the same traffic you report what rate of fraud you find and then we'll pick which one we like the best and surprise surprise they generally pick the one with the lowest fraud number so clients what we want we don't know but we want to right now so everybody wants it fixed but nobody wants to really do anything about it and the reason I think the supporting for the software engineering community is the most of the time when I talk to companies engaged in Mass fraud the engineers actually have no idea what's being done they're sitting there they're solving the technical problem
 everyday that figuring out Solutions everyday most of them don't realize how that technology is being used in the market I've spoken to engineers at the web Publishers that have 300 million a depression today and they don't actually realize that it's being monetized and a fraudulent method so everything is built on what software Engineers do now there's always some business guy in the spotlight you know taking credit for what the company does but none of it can be done without the engineering backbone and so the reason again the advertising fraud is so important is so many startups especially in the Silicon Valley San Francisco area get focused on her way in the building user base we have this many users this is our projection what's the point of a user base its to sell advertising eventually and so this constant cycle gets filled more and more by this business model

 I want to ask him a couple questions and then we'll do turtle audience questions I working out of there might be but so I started doing the podcast prices but I had been looking to do shows about advertising fraud because I worked very briefly at an advertising company and an ad tech company and it only took about a month to calendar stand that something was off about the way that the company worked and the way that it made money and I left that company not long after and in the intervening years between then and now I just learned as much about the advertising its ecosystem as I could and the more you look into it the spooky hour and doesn't make any sense how it works so my first question is your describing this Arbitrage we're basically a
 fraudster can pay for traffic that comes from a data center it's very cheap all cuz all it's doing is visiting web page and that webpage is also owned by the fraudster and the fraudster is running ads on that webpage
 how far can I take that business model and how much money can I make as an individual who is simply setting up websites like e celeb news or beef recipes.com running ads on it and paying for super cheap traffic that sounds like a great experience and the reason I know what I do about this industry is I used to work for a fragile that when I work that created tons of sites and used to Arbitrage traffic between exchanges when I started there we were doing about $500 profit the day and I was the first employee at startup surprise you know looks like a great position as first employee to digital advertising start up and I started and what they're doing $500 a day and by the end just me me spinning up random sites selling traffic through it $80,000 of profit a day
 I have no technical expertise I used an open-source ad server I would buy traffic salad into the exchanges and all these changes that we sold to would take me out to lunch every two weeks because we're making them so much and that serving piece and the account managers there don't have an incentive to report it because their bonus is tied to the revenue that their clients generate so traffic but I showed Is 4/10 of a cent for click the traffic I use for a celeb news was one tenth of a cent per click so you can buy for a hundred SEL for 500 you can buy for a hundred make 250 it really just depends on if you get the right to man Source from the adicts changes and you get the quality cheap traffic in businesses in Silicon Valley are Google and Facebook these are advertising companies
 do you have any idea how much money Google and Facebook are making alphabet what has been throttled so obviously if they're able to people generate traffic or able to like send their data through those filters and they can generate labeled supervisor but if somehow the clients are incentivized into some program like some type of certification like 50 clients like you give them and they start to demand is from you. The vendors in vendors and then they see a quake differentiate themselves by the longing to this program is there I mean Bears all types of certifications now there's what what I feel advertisers need is the it's not
 Family Resource intensive to build your own bot detection even some basic spot detection but but at least you have your own internal Baseline you know it's it's very strange to have two companies come in at 8 I detect 22% fraud we detect 48% fraud you have nothing to compare it to so if you have your own base line that says let's say 30% fraud you know that there's something off about the 22 that's detecting less so you need a lot of people just build their own models for classifying probably not fried or like some probability
 time. People can run it to your filter because you are the available change to fit you know if they need to have 30% returning visitors they create 30% for tournament starts it's mostly about changing the business practices of not on boarding every single site that comes to The Exchange it's dealing with the supply chain problem so early and I was like what's a run some sass business purple like some business advertising use the word
 brought it to Plains Montana seems like you're trying to fly actuality you are there any examples where the same as fraud has actually from Missouri high school history of punitive damages and there has been no legal consequences yet
 yeah but that's like I can have a ride solution to create they're going to figure it out right around so you see it before you see it going forward
 I do see it pop
 why because advertisers are getting smarter the only reason that this is continued is because advertisers haven't been paying attention they've had this inherent trust in the media that they buy and they're slowly and slowly starting to realize that hey maybe we should do our own dating somebody I'm paying an ad company the money to sell you know Coke ads on some somebody's blog Coca-Cola why would I keep throwing money at an ad agency doesn't actually deliver paying customers so you're still getting paying customers weather there organic weather Summit like 10% of them are from your advertising campaigns but now you have this Ry that you attribute to the money that you spent on
 and that's what field it so people say I get tax return from sending a million dollars on online advertising and as long as I get that next year the model works so liquid Coca-Cola the most advertisers don't have a direct response analysis says I spend this much how much should I get how much each sale were Allied they're doing brand awareness know but like there's so many advertises it just a brand awareness see as for Oreos and they just want to make sure of the Abyss whole thing and advertising scald share of voice they want to make sure that they're not being out Shine by their competitor stuff I'm Toyota Suzuki's buying more ads than I am I'm going to start spending more because I want to have my share of voice in the market
 actually good because the race of the bargain
 so why hasn't that hold payment model change when we don't pay for impressions today for results because not everybody's measuring results online you can fake play it's not just know it's like a different segment of the market then I mean think of
 are companies food companies Coca-Cola's every show me YouTube pre-roll ads are some dancing music commercial for a Pepsi and they're not looking at this person going to 7-Eleven and buy a can of Pepsi but there's no way for them to measure that it's all just about brand awareness for them
 like you said earlier, motivate others I want to be the top 5 WhatsApp Down Jason said it is if I could have hold even if a traffic between them
 I'm ready to turn by the membership which is Roi calculation
 registration for The Advertiser of the publisher
 so basically no no web publisher wants to limit their add opportunities to logged-in users
 sure
 I mean that would eliminate a lot of visits but
 and what are you buying
 I'm back. First dates and I don't by Bryson misses in act so I don't find pressions leaving play Taunton out there so it's the opposite thing but your questions and then we'll take a break
 instigation on both sides of the arm race
 Pokemon go player can weed out some of these thoughts like those the top. I would say that Google and white Ops was who's the company that released an order probably at the higher end of sophistication but again just basic theoretically like they're always going to be one step behind in the long run it's like antivirus and viruses sound like you never stop getting updates for antivirus system because the guys that create viruses will always figure out some pork round yes you mentioned a couple of boxes section then there's a big Delta and how about fixing that they tried to use that as an excuse or justification for the wildly different numbers because on the same traffic that's coming to the same site one was 90% 52% 44
 and 17% and part of that is the methodology of their box action part of that is a traffic vendors were targeting two of those companies as passing their filters but the rest of that is to save money and to sell smaller packages :-) packages to their customers about to start some companies will say we're going to sample 10% we're going to sample 5% to be able to sell them a package that's cheaper be able to have that customer but the problem is samples are only good if their representative of the population and if you're taking these impressions as they come with 10% one every 10 you don't actually know if it ends up being representative of the sample and that's the reason that they have such a wide disparities between them

Transcription: software companies that have been around for a decade have a ton of data modern machine learning techniques are able to turn that data into extremely useful models Salesforce users have been in a petabyte of data into the company's CRM tool since 1999 with its Einstein Suite of products salesforce's using that data to build new product features an api's Simon Chan is the senior director of product management with Einstein he oversees the efforts to give longtime Salesforce customers new value as well as the efforts to build brand new api's for things like image recognition and recommendation systems these are domain specific API that are really unique and they had to get a lot of value in that can form the backbone of entirely new businesses companies spend billions of dollars a year on sales and marketing and I want to understand where are the best opportunities for Salesforce lie Simon and I spent much of our time
higher-level applications but we did get to lower level engineering eventually there are 600 episodes of software engineering daily and it can be hard to find the shows that will interest you if you have an iPhone and you listen to a lot of software engineering daily you might want to check out the software engineering daily mobile app in the IOS app store you can access every episode of software engineering daily and we give you recommendations based on the ones you've already heard so you probably passed over some episodes that you might like we can give you recommendations on those I hope you like it and if you have any feedback send me an email Jeff at software engineering daily.com you can also talk to the creators of the software engineering Daily App they are actively looking for feature suggestions you can find them in the in the slack channel is the creators Craig and Keith holiday valued members of the software engineering daily community and you can find that slack Channel at the software engineering daily.com website I hope you like this episode
I sell podcast ads and podcast ads are a weird commodity many of my potential customers are not actively looking for podcast at so I can reach out to them with a cold email this cold email process is what lots of people go through whether they are marketing a software product a newsletter or an online course I know there are a lot of people who are listening to this who are building some kind of new software product and they're trying to figure out how to sell it if you're building your own business you have to learn to sell and if you're going to sell you have to learn to prospect prospect is the process of gathering email addresses and sending messages to potential customers Prospect. IO is my favorite tool for prospecting you can find email addresses of people at any company you can find email addresses of users on LinkedIn after you find those emails you can use Prospect Ohio to manage your prospects and to
send emails you can see when somebody opens your prospecting email and you can stop sending those emails when they have signaled that they're not interested if you're building a product you have to find customers to sell to how do you find customers by prospecting I've tried a ton of prospecting tools Prospect Ohio is my favorite Prospect Ohio is offering software engineering daily listeners 20% off your first two months just mention SE daily to prospect IO support after you sign up and if you're selling something tryout Prospect. IO I hope you enjoy it
Simon Chan is the senior director of product management with Salesforce Einstein Simon welcome to software engineering daily hi Jeff thanks for having me dear yes it's great to have you now I think of the term artificial intelligence as in many contacts to higher-level version of machine learning it's the product ization of machine learning products and video group that you probably agree with it some degree but I'd like this conversation to sort of start with a high-level exploration of some of the applications for artificial intelligence products and then we'll go into the engineering behind those so you work at Salesforce sales versus lots of opportunities for assisting customers with a i products explain the problem domains that Salesforce customers are facing that might be opportunities for AI to be helpful so it's super exciting topic and
is a very potent 50 years ago or even longer if people start exploring the idea of a i and as far as we think he is way too similar to men's to replace who is actually a lot of machines they try to do what humans can do and that's the biggest thing of AI right now nowadays a lot of businesses Supply day I to make customers most successful to improve the products to make things more intelligent and Salesforce customer is very important to us and we have to make it happen so the focus of AI in Salesforce is in CRM Salesforce about a year-and-a-half ago food Acquisitions off my company prediction I owe in a company were very sophisticated machine dining server
and I feel like joint Southwest I'm increasingly Amazed by how brought the scope of crms and I can see companies use sells was products in the entire customer success Journey from marketing to prospecting to manage to lead to another Miller's what leads is essentially the opportunities like stuff before becoming opportunity to buy your product services so people use us to manage to lead and just support customers to sell them products upsell South to do customer analytics in different channels so in Gmail in Mobile even in Connected apps social media and all this sounds was helping customers basically in every single touch point and applying Nai in this whole past form in this whole ecosystem is super exciting there a lot of opportunities
can explore we can make the smaller and more intelligent let's start with the example of a sales person like you said the sales person uses a CRM which is I think customer relationship management tool that's like basically holds all of your the data about people that are customers or my Venture become customers in a sales person who selling anything that you're selling vacuum cleaners or you're selling ass a stool doesn't really matter but in case if you're doing modern sales you're using a CRM describe some of the data sets that are available in a CRM and how does could potentially be leveraged for artificial intelligence company is used in Edisto scenario they use the CRM to manage keep track of the pro progressed so think about it you using your example Jazz if you're running selling vacuum cleaner
want to sell it to as many customers as possible so you list of potential customers and that's that you have so you have a giant list of fleets right and you have a great team top sales people but still time is limited everyday you can only make a certain number of course so you need to prioritize the list and Southwest provide what we called Einstein discovering so may I automatically help you identify who you should call you should call today the top 10 people that every sells people should we have in Salesforce broadly speaking there two types of data we called standard objects and custom objects
send an object is the standings in the Seattle Space account contacts genitti's leads products things like that so you can imagine like this music of getting a shower I'm up and running even more powerful is a concept called custom objects you can Define literally any types of datasets you want to put in Salesforce platform so you can create your own custom applications in your hole on top of this customer success platform you can create custom what fruit can we see some very creative ways of using Salesforce platform extend beyond just managing cells process for example some universities that use Salesforce to manage the admission process and they can use Einstein to protect which candidates are which applicants are more likely to accept the offer
what what impressed me is really the scope of Seattle and this broad is everything about customer example of little more flushing out the example of let's say I am I'm a University admissions person and I'm going to send out some emails to two people to let them know that they got accepted to my university what can you give an explanation for what are some of the predictive models that are being built behind the scenes that would be able to predict whether or not this University applicant is going to accept their acceptance into the university they're going to go with it. University like the kind of that the data sets and that and how those get pulled into a model on how that's going to predict things accurately the whole process involve a lot of a lot of components and maybe we can broaden the examples not just the Admissions contact
from the first that you do marketing and you send out a lot of emails one challenge emailed is is not structured data so baby write some really cool or really great copy writing text it just haven't got there in structured data and in your email you might include some images and images difficult to process in the machine and incense Einstein Einstein visions and Einstein language 228 that developers can use to understand what is exactly in the email and with historical data and now we can map say this can recipients he or she is more interested in certain keywords or certain color of image and interesting example as
cats and dogs right you can use Einstein vicios to detect an image weather is a character is a dog some people love cats a lot more like me and myself and some people would respond much better too. So by analyzing the email out and analyzing historical data now we can tell that marketers for this specific segments of customers you should on Taylor to emails like such and such for them and it will increase the response wait so you can also use Salesforce dashboard sales analytics to keep track of the result as well so is it really like a end-to-end solutions for us we would use a i to understand something that normally would reply human knowledge to understand but now we can do it in scale because API is Pokemon attic and makes it marketing campaign much more successful what I take that to mean is if
what's I have a campaign of 10,000 prospects and I send emails to to those 10000 Prospect and I have a series of interactions with those prospects you know I'm sitting here doing some a b testing along the way I'm sending some different images I'm sending some different keywords I'm just trying to sell all the vacuum cleaners and at the end of that maybe I sell vacuum cleaners to 500 of them and and then in that sense I have a labeled data set because I've got 500 leads that have converted into people that have actually purchase vacuum cleaners that also also got probably a bunch of people who dropped off along the way like people who maybe I had a phone call with them I tried to sell them a vacuum cleaner and I can enter it into my CRM that okay this person like I made a little progress with them but they ended up backing out where this takes us is machine learning that will or as many of the machine learning techniques that are that have been popularized recently are you are very useful for finding correlations
how long are unstructured data as long as that data is is labeled so could you could you explain a little bit more about you know what is going on under the covers to build models that the the properly can do those predictions like how is that unstructured data being Being Framed in a way that the labeling on that unstructured data can be interpreted as a predictive model so high on Salesforce we take advantage of one very important fact data is already ready on Southwest platform so think about it if you run a company vacuum so I can vacuum cleaner yourself teams is running the day-to-day operation on Celsius conversion is available
important foundation belt machine learning predictive model and on top of that we wants to understand number of things one s in Sanford Maine Stein segments to uncover casters of related customers in a personalized so understanding customers is important
 secondly we are meeting Sample about understanding the content or the product like to email contents are the products that you're selling with fishes with language understanding the machines can extract valuable information from just an image or even from like a voice audio files to understand the context of conversations or to understand your product so now you understand your customers ask the data historical data at the types of customers love this kind of product and this is all-powerful data set as Foundation to build Machinery model engineering techniques training data set is very important so just like you said Jeff you need to feed the machine on in our friends with successful examples
 better not successful examples as well so we call these kind of theater at then you can make accurate predictions and predictions you can make smarter decisions gramatik code sonar development teams improve code quality with static analysis it helps flag issues early in the development process allows developers to release better code faster code shown are can easily be integrated into any development process Advanced static analysis of C C plus plus Java and even raw binary code code sonar performance unique data flow and symbolic execution analysis to aggressively scan for problems in your code just like battleships use a sonar to detect objects

 so there's also these these api's that developers can use that I know are being built for do this this the Salesforce Einstein it's actually the thing that got me kind of excited about this I've been doing you know some shows about different API you know I got done shows about twilio and stripe and a p has a really exciting to me is a developer because I don't want to write yet another image recognition service I would much rather leverage higher-level api's and Stitch these together to build interesting futuristic application talk about some of the API that developers can use that have been built for Salesforce Einstein
 if he is indeed a great way to make a is accessible to broader audience through the developer communities they can build very powerful applications top of Southwest and we actually have a very long history of leveraging the developer Community think about Foster call Century that's the foundation in office as forest ecosystem customer can they use CRM process to people but they can build they can customize to see how I am however they want they can build custom business is business process on top of it and we extending this assess in Einstein
 so we offered number of ati's Einstein language is one Einstein language consists of Einstein intense and Einstein settlement so intense Einstein in town and can't help you understand unstructured data and if it's a label so for example of companies use Salesforce service Cloud to support customers when an email sent in you want to know which agents are which department you should Ralph's the emails to so with Einstein intent you can tell immediately and automatically just emailed us about billing problem this email is about technical support you don't need that humans to look at the email and automatically it to the right person
 the next one is Einstein Saturn and very importantly Einstein Solomon can tell you hey this email is lost if this email is negative but we did have fun staying here as when we feel the Einstein statment model will learn that is unique so I can tell you a funny story which we treated very sophisticated tomorrow to say normally you say your product is the hottest in Industry it is a very positive comments right you got to call Sprouts on Market but there's one customer they sell air conditioner your product is the hottest on the market is not that great in that context so we actually opened up the API its customer to train the old model as well so you can improve the model based on your custom industry knowledge and I
 we need to provide that possibility to make it successful and on top of Einstein language additionally we also offer Einstein Visions so you can recognize image and we sexy cast customers using it with great success to detect the brands like on social media they can say they can see immediately this photo can taste my logo and it's something say it about my company and I want to monitor that it is super useful for customers and we see more more developers using it very creative applications
 okay let's talk about that little bit so the brand detection model I found this interesting cuz I'm I'm working on an advertising product right now and small company building as it's like something we could potentially using but I think about it like I wonder how this is built because so so let's say you you want to let's say you're a small like peanut butter company and you make a custom peanut butter no seats really good peanut butter it's high-quality you know but there's probably a small customer segments that buys it you don't know who those customers are cuz it's at stores all across the world in so but people are taking pictures of it you know maybe they are there their they're making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and they take a picture of it and they put it on Instagram and and that's like something that you want so maybe you can I've got some crawler going over Instagram posts and looking for your pictures of your peanut butter so what how do you train that model like if I'm just a random peanut
 company how am I using a brand brand detection API or or or maybe you could just talk more broadly about how that model is trained how that that specific API the brand detection API the idea that I can upload a photo or call an API on a photo and be able to detect Brands within that how is that built you need to give the machine a lot of examples you don't want to kiss it machines the perfect examples like of course you can send the perfect logo to it and say hey this is the peanut butter logo but what we really want is photo that is not so perfect just one dining table and that's what we want and with that table you label that say this area is particle area is
 you don't need to label that you can just submit thousands of photo with that peanut butter jar say with in this photo. Out how you wanted to text it so Define API we have deep learning technology we spent a lot of resources lot of time to invest to to invent new as cutting Technologies to detect this kind of logo and so developers they don't need to worry about which Albert and we're using but what I need to worry about is how do I find more examples to tell Southwest Einstein and this photo we don't have a job and then you can figure it out we have underneath behind API we have some what we called Global model wave pre-trained data set so we train tomorrow to detect.
 this particular area is likely to be a logo and we traded with some existing information that we have but for smaller companies off of new products you can submit your old data API is also sign Stein and the tip learning engine to a train based on your data automatically and chewy the result to bite you in the result that means that you submit the image through the rest API of reporting to location and then we can return the result with some confidence called to say 80% with 80% confidence at 60% with 70% confidence that it is something else so it's not an absolute protection to say we normally prediction is
 but we make the best estimation best predictions through the data data and phone without developer is can't decide how to use it right it sounds like with if you have some kind of curation endpoint then you can also continuously improve the model overtime sometimes we learn new models periodically and sometimes we update the motto in real time so it really depends on the use case in the image recognition case we don't see the need of Butte I'm updating tomorrow sometimes like for example security or other areas that we see that we actually need to be updated so I have a photo sharing app like I said that I'm that I'm building and but just assumed it Instagram and I know that Einstein Einstein also has his recommendation system
 location API I want to use his recommendation API to rank my feed of photos like I've got there's a bunch of a corpus of photos and some number of those photos are going to be are going to be displayed to my to you know certain users I mean I like this idea of just having a recommendation system as an API because who wants to who wants to build yet another recommendations has been done so many times so explained how I would leverage an API to be able to build a recommendation system that's a perfect example. Wish I'd been standing is recommendation handling images news text recommendation or they may be good at looking at his Taco behavior and then based on Culebra
 best photo sharing is a very tricky example but thanks to Einstein Visions now we can extract very valuable information from image automatically sell Instagram example you upload an image Einstein Visions can classified image can't eat at what is it image how many of such objects are in the image so I said you upload a cat photo I always like to use to catch an example because I have classified ads okay this is like casual daily life photo and two cats in it
 now we understand product product means the photo in this case we need to understand users customer service means understanding customers so based on previous photos that you share or based on a previous photo. You like your brows more with all this information we have built we can build a really decent graph about each customer and not only that we can Custer customers say you are similar to this other a 50 people because they like this cat is a new cast photo even though you don't see it is tell us you like it but we sing. You might like it so we can recommend that photo to you
 go back to the basics of recommendation I'm sure Nana is really about understanding the product understanding customers and correlation between product to product customer to customers and customer to products can you talk more about what's going on in the back end with with this kind of API like when I using it's like what's going on at the covers that's my favorite topic actually prediction Iowa correctional officer is very popular spot space mission dining server and the technology behind we focus really on production scale and scalability when we train tomorrow is all distributed when we surf tomorrow is elastic is scalable
 when we build Einstein platform we got a lot of inspiration from the technology that we have built in the past one thing that is unique in Salesforce is multi-tenant when one single company building the model for yourself you just focus on your one specific date but Southwest we have 200,000 customers and more and we wants to be the personal data scientist for every single company is not just one company but everything we want to take to have a lifting do we do that for so many companies so we need to automate a lot of machine learning processes feature extraction model selection model testing
 we need Francis esqueda Technologies to automate every one of them which company so going back to that sentiment analysis example in some use cases we will build up Global model so you can just come in and use it but we also provide the flexibility 4ish companies to train update tomorrow for the specific needs what's the specific data set in some cases for example Einstein discovering we even filled every model based on every customer's unique data so you not sharing the model with automatic data so the scale as cute as you can imagine process lot of data make a lot of customers at the same time
 how do I turn the machine learning Frameworks that you're using the stand that one is of course prediction I was built on spot and definitely just a lot of standard technology like spots like a storm that we have in our machine on a pipeline we need to make sure that they have robust it stable and their scalable and we have very rigid test for for for all is okay so you've mentioned like spark and storm and some proprietary stuff just kind of gives him an overview for like what are the use cases where you have spark running under the covers where the use cases for storm and then where's the place where you had to build some kind of from scratch technology it is a very interesting engineering
 we always says that the product is always discussed when should we use existing technology and when should we start developing a load basic principle fanciful so whenever does existing product that can meet our requirements did robust they have a good strong community support and pass out trust security test of course then we will try to use them but that many cases that we actually need to go down for example to fulfill the multi-tenancy nature of Salesforce we need a lot of Technologies to automate the process to automatically scare the system to automatically train tomorrow to automatically store tomorrow and we need to update
 in-house just because we can't find comparable technology on the market

 okay so I did some shows about Sparkle while ago and I did some shows about storm and you can correct me if I'm wrong I didn't remember super well but my recollection is like spark is really good if you have this data set the memory you want to have a working set in memory and you just don't want to perform a bunch of different operations like a series of operations on this and you just keep it all in memory at the same time as opposed to the priests Park days where you kind of had like I do a series of Hadoop jobs and every time you run a Hadoop Java checkpoints to disk and that creates a lot of late and seeing as opposed to just having everything in memory of a spark and then storm is sort of more of like a workflow thing where it's like you've got the series of nodes in a graph and everything that's that's streaming that comes in your streaming through this the storm graphic
 so the two but I'm just trying to remember plenty of people saying for most things you can use either sparker storm it doesn't really matter just matters I kind of how you want to use it you know what's your preference but I guess I am just trying to drill down a little bit deeper into where you where you would select spark and where you would select storm we have a lot of applications write a different position lines for example we have cell service marketing Commerce analytics and other stuff we Einstein covers describes different data science Team Building Solutions for different clients sometimes we need really fast real-time processing example in iot case
 process time immediately can't even afford to have the Michael basch latency so you need to reroute I'm processing in this areas maybe technology like storms will be better we focus more on how well you can maintain the software code how well you can Shadow Cove used to code the technologies that the audience will be most suitable so we don't have a clear-cut to say Xbox shop so we are still in shop it really depends on the applications and teens the fastest I said we would not like to stick to only what's available on the market
 and sometimes we just have to developed in China Technologies to fulfill the examples come to mind of when you had to build something
 sew-in in a my team we focus a lot on the scalable data science side so we use a combination of existing Technologies and technologies that we built to automate the process data science problem we don't find another place since you have so many customers and you need to automatically extract information bill tomorrow for and mayonnaise tomatoes so management is one area we'd invest a lot of resources same to you we can get into the details but I can tell you that this is really one of ten talents to work in a company because this problem is challenging and it is so unique but at the same time you can bring if you can achieve that it would bring a lot of impact 2
 a lot of people a lot of a i petition is we want to make a I'm more accessible to customers and I think this is truly the place where when you built one solution that say you Bill Einstein live scoring you don't want applications and hundred thousand customers can use it which impact each of them has a lot of customers so we building a platform Einstein first one where you can build one application that you spot a lot of companies yeah okay I really want to dive into the orchestration and scaling of machine learning models cuz we touch on is a little bit and a show I did with Matt Seiler from clarify and he was doing was talking about how I think they're typical wait at a train and you deploy it to a container a Docker container and they I think they use kubernetes Docker container running on kubernetes
 and then put the problem with that is like you have new example to come in and you want to update the model so you know. Okay are you updating the model in real time we update them at the mall offline and then you know eventually you spin up a new container and and then you know gradually shift the traffic from the old model to the new model but you know that was with that so that was like a simplified example in their lots of caveats and it sounded like a really interesting problem basically this intersection of like you said Model Management and and serve orchestration to can you talk to talk about that a little more detail is that are similar to what you do Machining technology in several areas that required a lot of computation resources we start with training
 right you need to take a lot of data Tivoli Theater is historical data or image in the training station to go is to use this training data with labels to produce a model it requires a lot of computation resources training initial model or retrain the modern periodic least that's one stage if you're talking about if we need to be this is how do you use the motto so using the model of broadly speaking you can divide it into squatting so batch scoring targets you want to predict prediction
 so that's also very happy process but sometimes you want to surf the model on demand so we called a Time serving as I'm sure you have a motto you don't make decisions immediately placed on the route I'm Cherry maybe with some contacts on the flight prediction so it's difference between scoring Edge scoring and serving right one is more about real-time latency the other one is more about making a huge amount of production and you need to start a prediction effectively and then evaluation you need to see how well your motto is you need to run it again some evaluation metrics so evaluation is also and then the last one is model update so in the patch mode you can retrain the whole model again but in some scenarios you want to update the model on the Fly
 we called it online learning specially when a user give you a real like news about you want to talk to you tomorrow immediately so this other categories I would consider you request a lot of resources some of them you can make it up a batch job some of them would we end in the best job case then we need to ask to mate the size of the job we have developed technology to do that each customer is unique some of them they have really lost datasat some of them they're just getting started to have a stator so we automatically estimate the job size and all of the right resources to do this training job on the owners need to understand the application contest we need to determine whether this applications required reeltime Productions or just applications aspire to make it like
 and I think a lot of people confused about a batch and Route I'm so you can update you can still start the model in real time you don't need to have all things real time and all these decisions all this product questions guide us to determine what technology what's the best solution because there is so many applications in Southwest this an all interesting product plus engine in questions we were together and I'm actually very excited working in Celsius Einstein guess there's so many experts in in a team we have experts in infrastructure we have expert in data engineering with extra length in science so
 discussions everyday interesting okay so what about the the scaling orchestration with regards to the larger server capacity planning so you know you've got all these models that your building for customers and you know new models are being spun up all the time new customers are coming in your scaling up your scaling down how does that relate to like this overall server capacity planning where is the pool of servers that you're accessing and how do you cut a predict how much resources you you're going to need available just in case of spikes and whatnot Einstein rents on Southwest trusted or two 10in Cloud it includes both of us infrastructure so sometimes we just leverage existing technology to scale it as an example
 in some areas we have a scalable Technologies in our Datacenter so it's a mix of them I think what it would what is a higher level API show at lower-level API image recognition simple image recognition API what is in this image that's what kind of a lower-level API search something that's really good for for Google to do for example Google has been doing image search for a really long time but there's plenty of room for people to come in with higher-level API that are built on top of the lower level API so I'm curious if there are any API from other cloud service providers that you're leveraging cuz because again I think salesforce's kind of it in this position where you're at you kind of have a higher level customer customer base.
 like you know survive sales I know Salesforce have some some platform-as-a-service products but I think of it as the same mentality of why salesforce's more more about SAS than and then pass is a very good observations we have in did we do have different layers of offerings to developers if you look at the history existing offerings outside AI we have applications service customizable SS with developer I miss you and you can customize it however you want
 the layer that we have we show false we have four starcom Enterprise developer with a mix of some code a scripting language with some Michelle toes then you can build your customized applications and then going down to the next level we also have iroku iroku is essentially just slightly on top of adverse infrastructure developers as soon as you can select what database you use like or as you can see like what messaging system so we can get to really like the details developer choices and I think we are offering something similar in Einstein
 go down to the level of API we have image we have language API endpoint in create a custom applications going up a little bit we also have free boat applications for example like Einstein Beats cord or protective audience decide applications you can use you just like one parent and you enable that but at the same time you can also customize it and in between if you have some custom data you want to customize it also provides flexibility for you to choose your side of Manassas may be very different from other industry you want to customize it so we give this customer ecosystem is
 very important and we try to get some different flexibilities to soft soft the problem and so talking about the API going back to your questions we have to do sound technology when whenever possible Southwest music sells boss we use our CRM to do all cells service in Einstein we also use our vision API AI language ati's to do a lot of tasks so whenever Technologies available in house we use it whenever a technology is available outside we don't want to be in that's it for you but if there's case that we can stuff out customers better we will just got to take us to it and feel 253 technology okay makes sense I want to get to wrap up how do you keep up with this field because the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence is moving quite fast do you read papers do you go to
 conferences giving techniques yeah it's a fast-moving space several years ago I came over my address. Of different some research study was changed into Salesforce from prediction IO Industries is a combination of all the things you mentioned I speak in conferences exchange ideas with dahlias where speakers I attend conferences research papers papers we talk to customers so working in Salesforce we have the advantage to talk to customers and of time customers can tell you what's going on in despacito fake industry what is a need what's the pain pointer that's the also makes us really exciting about cells Einstein is that we're not doing pure research
 solving customer problems we are building so do you have any thoughts on what are the biggest challenges for for managing the Einstein project like cuz it sounds like you got a lot of service area to cover near do you mention you have a bunch of different teams bunch of different engineering teams you got a wide variety of customers just managing the project in and how do you do how do you prioritize in and manage the different teams in the biggest challenge actually sticky what is keratinization biggest challenge to me the possibility of Success Unlimited all the business lines on one hand we know that we have the capability we have the resources to do a lot of things we can make
 processed very smart we can help Custom Companies to uncover customer inside we can help them predict an event we can help them make smarter decisions automatically and faster AI in so many areas so of ideas of inside 10 shows we can't do everything at the same time so prioritization is important solution for that gas again is to talk to customers they can tell us precisely what they need next month what it needs next year
 so it's an ongoing battle to say so many exciting things we can do less focus on just a number of things make them work really well and deliver Valdosta customer alright Simon well it's been great talking to you about Salesforce and Einstein and all the stuff you're doing there I look forward to seeing what comes next exciting space and I hope that a lot more information about Einstein so state to into our new offerings okay thanks

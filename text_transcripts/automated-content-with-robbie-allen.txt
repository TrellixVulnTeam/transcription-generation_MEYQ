Transcription: you have probably read a news article that was written by a machine win earnings reports come out or a series of sports events like the Olympics occurs there so many small stories that need to be written news organization like the Associated Press would have to use all of its resources to write enough content to cover all of the stories going on Wordsmith is a tool for automated content generation and today's guest Robbie Allen is the CEO of automated insights the company that makes Ward Smith & Jerry's episode he talks about the wide range of uses for automated content and why it's not going to steal jobs we also talked about how to engineer a product that takes data from a spreadsheet and turns it into a human readable sentence Robbie is also speaking at the O'Reilly artificial intelligence conference in New York September 26th thru 27th if you're interested in checking that out before we get to this episode a few quick announcements if you're interested in advertising on software engineering daily send me any
Jeff at software engineering daily. Com there are more than 14,000 Engineers that listen to software engineering daily on a regular basis so it's a great place to get your product out into the ears of developers or to advertise available jobs do you might have your company also if you're an engineer that's looking for an open source project to work on checkout software daily at software daily.com this is an open-source news and information site about software it's being led by Jeff AAA member of the software engineering daily Community you can also check out software engineering daily.com which is the website for this podcast you can find links to the slack Channel my Twitter account my email you can find a link to sign up for our newsletter software weekly and with that let's get to today's episode is so useful that I've started using it on
my own personal projects snap CI from thought Works has the fastest setup I've ever seen I registered for SNAP CI with my GitHub account and after a few clicks I had continuous integration pipelines setup for a no JS application and a rails application that were just sitting on my GitHub account and I don't want my users to experience breaking changes so I want to run a large sweet of test for my application every time I push a change and snap see I will run those tests quickly in parallel on a worker that snap CI spins up and takes care of for me what do you have personal projects like me or you work at a company that is looking for the perfect tool to improve the deployment process go to snap. Co / software engineering daily snap she embodies the lessons that thought Works has learned from 20 years of software deployment the same lessons that have been written about by Martin Fowler and Jazz humble check it out it's nap
CI / software engineering daily it would support software engineering daily and you would get to check out continuous-deployment snap. CI / software engineering daily thanks for listening
 Robbie Allen is the CEO of automated insights Robbie welcome to software engineering daily thanks for having me at automated insights you are building a tool called Wordsmith what is Wordsmith Wordsmith is a natural language generation platform that helps people structure narratives are stories in a way that you can apply a data set and grade does Tundra 2000 about put from a single structure data driven driven storytelling a couple of examples that are some of our work around earnings report for we take that's generated by a public company
 yeah we were more focused on quantitative analysis in qualitative but still these have been in place for a couple years and we've been in business since 2010 generating over a billion pieces of content of year at this point for the people who are reading this continents get gets generated why would the people rather read the content rather than just reading the data itself before I did actually Sports analytics website called stat sheet and what I did with stat sheet was actually create all sorts of interesting metrics visualisations around Sports data but what I found was that Wilder is there a rabid fan base of sachy for lack of a better word that's actually pretty small audience in fact most people what they prefer is just to have the info
 describe a very plain English they don't understand in their native language what's going on with the data answer that was really sort of impetus behind automated insights was instead of requiring everybody to be a data analyst or data scientist we can boil down to the plain English accessible by Birch Lane sentences and paragraphs that are consumable at desirable to be consumed by humans we often think of the flourish is that a good writer will put into their writing are those flourishes actually important to having good written content or is it really just the fact that the sentence Bears some resemblance to the types of conversations that were having date
 so it totally depends on the type of content you're talking about so for example one of the limitations we've had running the longest is what Yahoo where we generate Yahoo fantasy football Recaps during the fantasy football season in Yahoo has several million fantasy users and each week after the season's over after the week's over we generator recap for every match at that occurred on their platform so it's several million Recaps that happened every single week and those are pretty snarky and nature so in fact that was sort of the feedback that Yahoo gave us is that they wanted him to be humorous they wanted them to be snarky they wanted to encourage you they wanted to highlight the things you did well but also highlight the things you didn't do well because what we found was that encourage people to play even more right they wanted to prove the recap wrong or they wanted to show Yahoo that they were better player than maybe with the recap had had described it again
 you can have a particular tone versus you know getting back to the AP earnings reports they have a very sort of in a financially oriented tone that you know there's no humor in those but there's a reason why you can't have either depending on the setting are you saying that Schumer or tone or snark these are things that can be automated just like completely dry reports absolutely in fact a simple sentence like you had a good quarter you know that that sounds very subject you had a good quarter what is what does good mean but actually there's no reason why you can't make that you can put a formula you can print it out to Define what good is and it almost any setting right it could be in fantasy football recap and if if you can describe something is good then you can also in a make a a snarky,
 about something being good or bad that again is very data-driven but there's no reason why you can't have that level of tonality built into it just says you do in your normal everyday speech
 if we're talking about earnings reports or fantasy football statistics and we want to translate those datasets into written content that will be consumable by human readers what is the format that a typical data set needs to be in in order to be consumed by Wordsmith and generated into human readable content with words so works and it has an API which means it has a ton of flexibility in terms of you know what you can do with the data and and also the content currently we support a sort of single row of data per report type of model where into a single row decadently access within a Wordsmith in LG template experience
 you know that was sort of your comfortable and it didn't seem like this complicated thing on its faces is not necessarily into a type of scene 4 lot of users write this trying to build conditional logic into your prose is not something that comes easy to a lot of people so you know keep the data requirements fairly simple the things that we've built in the past had all sorts of complex data in a multi table Arrangements in a lots of data crunching and things that went on behind the scenes that's what are internal platform such as providing tools to help you structure stories and we kind of collision at least for now
 when we are learning to write whether it's in high school English class or just working on our own getting better as writers we are not thinking in most cases about how can we write a narrative that has a purple permutations built-in for all future purposes of when I would want to use that narrative in so it sounds like that's the challenge that you were encountering in the early days of building Wordsmith is how do you give people on an intuitive experience for creating content structure that can be permitted across all these different instances of Davis I like if you need if you want to do the earnings reports thing you need to write a narrative that for a generalized instance of an earnings report but that generalized instance needs to be able to fit
 with each of the rows in the the set of earnings reports and it sounds like building that generalizable primitive experience was not simple that's right it is just for the exact reason that you hit on that you know most people challenge for us is if you think of all the areas of our daily lives were technology has had an impact over the last 20 years I mean it's just about every aspect of our life right at Technologies had some some major some major role but if you think about the writing process that's actually not changed a whole lot in the last 20 years right I mean we have software now is posted mechanical you know typewriters or even digital word processors or whatever but the at the process of writing is not really that much different than how you would have done it in grade school
 Wordsmith really is is one of the first areas where you know we're really innovating on the writing process and we're doing that buy essential changing how people right so there's an opportunity there right because we're going to enable you to do so much more but there's also a challenge because this isn't something you're familiar with more technically inclined people that people that have an understanding of data and how to manipulate data tend to do the best out of the gate but we're also encouraged by some of our Lee customers that even someone that just you know has a really good night for riding especially in assorted data-driven environment can also pick it up step through a little bit of how you use the text editor so if I am a writer for the Associated Press for example and I want to write some way to generate content for all of the earnings reports
 should I sit down in front of the word Smith text editor how do I get started writing with this this narrative that is going to be able to permute across all of the different earnings reports standard writing process that the way in which you can bury one way that you may get started as just a writer and report right so you experience is just a short one permutation Licious crate and then you can go in and start figuring out what aspects of this could change so you know there is a place where it said that there was an increase in Revenue this quarter compared to last quarter
 so now we need to go in and account for that and currently in the works in the better to there's really sort of three different things that you can do you know to just order them belly standard text one as you can add a date of Berryville which is what we call a just placing in Excel of data into the end of The Narrative change Revenue increased to 230 230 million could be a replacement or it could even be a whole sentence or paragraph replacement just randomly choose between you know any of the options you select so we said it had a good increase that had a great increase in had a you know above average increase you can have all these different words that are sexually active synonyms and then the third thing is called a branch and for us a branch
 the way to essentially derivation of of the text that text occurring right so you know we want to talk about Revenue going up you know or maybe we want to talk about Revenue going down or we don't talk about Revenue at all we could create a branch to says if Revenue this quarter Revenue greater the last word of Revenue then talk about Revenue going up else if Revenue this quarter is lower than Revenue last quarter than talk about it down otherwise talk about profit margin help understand and in crap one of these structures chip from a programmer's point of view this would look something like a switch statement where you were going to switch on the synonym you use or the branch of text type
 can you use based on what the contents of a given column in a given a row are correct OK Google is like if it's Dan else by Logic closed right series of product reviews or analysis of sports games or obituaries I can write one version of it and then I can label specific aspects of that analysis of a sports game or the product review and I can just label an aspect of it and say hey this is a area that is going to permute based on if a certain aspect of this Row in the database changes and you know along with different branches and different synonyms these permutations are going to see more now
 is that accurate
 okay so is this the same thing that like when you had human content creators like maybe 5 or 10 years ago when if it if you needed a fleet of cumin content creators to write all of the results from basketball games are fun in a fantasy football games if those were actually being written 5 or 10 years ago is this what they were essentially doing 5 or 10 years ago the same process that a human go when they're riding imagine you put a million fantasy football recap stories that need to be written in front of a person you know what is the thought process that they go through when they're crazy Sprite and it's a very similar as related to you know if a team blew out their opponent or if they had
 are the scored the most points in the whole league or if it was a really close match up or if it was a come-from-behind you at potentially draw from depending on what happened in the underlying data then you can go about writing and crapping story based on what will happen right and you can think about what is very similar except instead of you doing it on a single in a menus to essentially run with it without you having to do anything
 to a company that is creating automated content whose responsibility is it to use wordsmyth do the people who used to write the masses of content do they now use wordsmyth
 yes it was really depends on here we have a variety use of Industry using Wordsmith in fact when we first launched the beta back in October of 2015 in a few had to request access and the request actually she had to select which industry you you belong to you and there are 42 Industries in that list within the first week of people that have requested access and so does it generally applicable on the Flies across a bunch of and one of the challenges with that is that mean to type of person that uses only seen everything from digital marketing to data analyst date of the developers to even Executives analytics at sports franchise
 to be the most successful are folks that do have some basis for understanding release conditional key when you're really starting to crash some of these you have to be able to understand how to structure the story with conditional logic in a way that allows you to capture in a most of the key topics and in ways that the story may may turn out I can imagine these certain domains where words with makes a ton of sense like these product reviews or earnings reports and I can also Imagine scenarios where it obviously does not make sense like an editorial maybe editorial written about you know why Donald Trump is you know of viable candidate versus Hillary Clinton or something like that where there's not really it doesn't make sense to have words with be doing the work are there any areas that you feel are somewhere in between where you
 feel like wordsmyth should be able to work or maybe you're just on the cusp of getting it to work or you've been surprised by its Effectiveness or ineffective is what are the areas that are right in the margins between the disease more obvious automatable areas in the ones that are not automatable
 that's a good question I mean you know we're seeing is still pretty early days even though we've been at this a while now that we have a self-service platform in Wordsmith that essentially Nables anyone to to try it out at a relatively affordable price you know we're seeing all sorts of use cases that we never would have anticipated or never would have targeted in on her own everything from your non-profit type of reporting to Integrations with a b i Solutions like tipco and Tablo to e-commerce product descriptions and I would say your eCommerce is kind of an interesting one on the one hand it's it's a perfect type of shit for work because generally you have a whole catalog of you maybe hundreds of thousands of products and you need to create descriptions that you're going to put on your side and you know hopefully they'll be attractive attractive
 do well in SEO that we seen there though is the data isn't always as good as it needs to be and that really is sort of a key with an LG specifically is that not only does it need to be a sort of a good ability to have an SR22 to talk about the day to you also have to have the data and if the date is not in good shape then that's going to be problematic to create the narrative and so it does kind of the challenge that you have to consider when you're thinking about and what what makes a good in LG type of automated story well there has to be the story but then they're also has to be data to support that story so there might be where the data is less clean the data is less consistent and that makes it more challenging to generalize a narrative around that data
 let me talk to people they're like yeah it's just not a citrus or you know we can't see any application for this impacted tends to be the opposite which is the bigger challenge generally comes down to I think of five or six cases but I don't I can't necessarily get all the data for it and so data tends to still be the long pole in the tent as far as figuring out how to make worst network

 wealthfront.com SE daily thanks to wealthfront for being a continue to sponsor of the show now let's get on with the show
 let's talk about the engineering of Wordsmith can you give me a description for the technology stack at work Smith completely cloud-based solution although we do have an on-premise capability we run everything on Amazon we've been using Amazon since 2009 or 2010 Amazon Services goes but specifically for Wordsmith he was a pretty standard stock these days you know where a ruby shop we use angular on the front end you know we use postgres for the database we use S3 for storage you know it's it's it's it's pretty standard as far as that is that goes human has to generate
 the first version of the content for you. Given narrative that is going to permute three different versions of the data and then you're going to add synonyms branching statements things like that give me a sense of the data structures that are being used to generate this narrative and the permutate of abilities of the narrative as we've seen a little bit of everything from from clients hear everything from simple data sets in a 10:15 columns to figuring out what is going to be our limit what's the limit on the number of columns that we can support because we've had some people that come back and said alright we want to have a thousand column data set that we want to add in so supporting that is is obviously something that you know it is always something that you know we have to consider respect
 you represent like how do you end up in the parsing or what what is your you know your workflow parsing stuff and then represented in memory and you know getting it ready to be permuted what are the different steps there and how do you water the data structures that you're using to model those / mutated instances of parsed text her that it's actually takes one of our energy templates think about it as a you know it it's a it's a it's a mini program essentially right with with tax built into it because it supports you know if then else type of logic and so we have a template structure that enables us to essentially crate that you know will will when somebody in a click save or we automatically save it or if we can go to start generating
 content from data we can check the validity validity of the template and then from there we can start plugging in any of the data and essentially evaluating the template much like you would have a simple program in so that also enables us to have a compiled solution because we can if you think about these templates as many programs and essential what they are and we can compile those templates and executable code template is a program that can run completely on premise so we have blue cloud an on-premise Solutions at school so what who are the types of domains where they're looking for an on-premise version two primary ones are finance and health care you know those are typically the types of of customers that can't send their data over the internet in a 2-2 are pandas on in this case
 take me to have everything in house and so say they're wanting to generate reports about use some internal metrics that they're they're collecting they don't want to send those metrics to our differences in the cloud actually been a really big service for us because most sass offerings don't offer on print solutions or at least they don't very easily but our solution actually works out fairly well to have an on-premise capability
 there is this pattern of using were Smith where company might have a huge back catalogue of proprietary data and then maybe they've got some real time data that streaming in and they also want to have access to some public data sources and ears like in most cases or Riu most cases but in many cases it's not like you've got this you're the CSV to static CSV that the company has and they just want to generate all of the permutations for their words with a narrative right now it's like sometimes you might have all of these different disparate data sources and they're being updated at different time intervals how do you integrate these different types of data and how did they get streamed through a narrative give me some description of how that works so we made a conscious decision not to support
 complex arrangements with a Wordsmith out of the gate mostly because how to how to create a new tool tools out there that will help you focus on energy tool developers data Sciences go to if they are trying to to automated recording in Subway and so they are the date of plexity out of the equation by requiring it to be slapped now in just about every situation any data set
 getting to before some people requesting you know thousand columns Inn in the date of the throat loading was taken in most cases you can and so it's not to say that you still can't actually do what you need to even if you have complex stated it may require a step or two beforehand that we actually have a managed Services component of our company that will actually do this for customers that they needed in the process as people become more familiar and comfortable working in the data side of things
 Scag that makes sense cuz yeah yeah I guess it wouldn't be that hard if somebody hit has all these different sources of data and just to set up hooks to get that data into the format that it needs to be in to be words with compliant and that way you can focus more on the Wordsmith product development itself as another sort of integration Solutions so you know that that's another way too kind of handle the date a problem is since you haven't already eat somewhere and you want to just quickly be able to create a word that you can just do it straight from in those tools that say you had sells for something else and you wanted to create a works of narrative automatically when something occurs now is there is a pure inebriation you can do
 Easley interviewing these people who have started companies are there CTO or CEO seem like focus on a specific on a very specific well-defined aspect of their business is highly correlated with success and a particular D Ed knowledgement of the trade-offs of that focus and you know you can think of all kinds of adjacent product opportunities that exist to wordsmyth how in your structuring of the company in your your business strategy how do you determine what are the adjacencies to focus on versus the core business opportunities
 well for us since it's pretty easy early day because energy is such a new technology A New Concept for most people just focusing on sort of online experience creating the best API for it that just does the basics of it is super important right and then from there there's a dedicated research team which is unusual for a company of our Advanced capabilities for words that that's like experts in machine learning and you know all these things where
 you know we should be able to help user more than you know at least as well as tooling to to help make that process smoother and so you know for us there's there's lots of different directions to go into lots of integration opportunity like I said we've already released in Excel integration we have lots of companies exploring but you're making this the easiest in LG system to work with it and hopefully is much like such as happening and you're getting the SEC Advantage actually have an interest me at the description that we've given for the product so far it sounds fairly iterative it's like okay you get the make this static narrative and then you just
 use plug in all of the different columns all the different rows of data you have and why lie you have your generated pieces of content of course this smacks of a product that has opportunities for machine learning to What specifically are those opportunities
 yeah one of the you know it is this challenging because while it seems like an obvious area for machine learning it's actually anytime it comes to natural language is one of the most challenging areas to do something completely automated in fact even seen or some of your listeners I've seen some of the attempts to you know automatically generated novel or that is using deep learning to to generate Harry Potter text or to generate some of these other things the readable you can read it they don't make much sense and that's a problem is humans are so finely tuned the language that it's difficult just to be 75% right percent right to be able to pass and that's just extremely difficult to do you know with the existing technology
 send a text to say that there's not something that can be done a bunch of different ways to to Optimal way is it an expert system driven type of solution is machine learning improving or to add more variability in your text you know I think we're still pretty good ways away from being able to just have it and automatically generate the text that you want in a from that without any additional input input infinite number of outputs that you could generate right now there's the assumption that we will just give you my data I want you to generate the report I don't want to do anything well for any of that data said I mean we really could talk about hundreds thousands millions of things
 things you know that you're most interested in it so you know that that's where I think humans will continue to play an active role in the process but I do think you'll be surprised at how how much is able to hell why not maybe necessarily doing all of it for you is some examples some small examples of people trying to do some something kind of similar is that the system is like axe. That do the automated replying and scheduling of calendar events for you and many times they still have to kick the process to a human in the loop and have the human do the last mile of the scheduling and then also there were there was this a Fert by Google to do a system called smart reply where you could just easily you know you can if you're replying to somebody in an email
 maybe Google presents you with three or four different responses that you might want to. Just one click reply to people but these systems still seem like they're in their infancy they still send these are like fairly well to find domains what are the what do you feel is like the low-hanging fruit more specifically in terms of how you can mix I guess not only low-hanging fruit in terms of the automated content creation but the the low-hanging fruit in terms of how this is actually going to measurably benefit your end users and sometimes when I tell people so we eat your automated insights what's the name of the company and that's more than any other company in the world which sounds kind of crazy since we're
 it was small company but that's true in the only way that that is true because it's automated and there's been studies there's no Professor people have not been able to tell the difference on average but even though we generate that content people ask her why why do we need that too much constant already and I completely agree there's already there is too much content in the world the problem is it's a generic personalized overall number of pieces of content would be greater the amount that you would have to read is an individual to go down significantly and things like that so to me that's always been the opportunity is really cool personalized
 automated story that summarize a workout that you just had things of that nature of your portfolio of stocks summary of those are much more interesting than you going out and reading you know what's going on with Cisco stock what's going on with Facebook stock everything that's that's a great point and I hear I read these on your Facebook feed until like maybe it's like a long editorial about brexit and like you click on it and it's like 10 pages long and it's like oh my God in the internet age I don't have time to read this and you start to scroll through it is like so many things that are may be hard to understand if you don't have the correct context but at the same time you can imagine that that article would be a good important read for people at all different levels weather you
 New York Times article about brexit whether you don't know about brexit at all or you're well-versed in geopolitical dynamics that article could write in an Ideal World could contain different degrees of specificity different degrees of editorial flourishes different degrees of like level 1 like facts hey this is what the Eurozone is Etc in an ideal world like you know if you're reading an article from The New York Times there's no reason that couldn't be personalized for you I try to ignore the example I like the sports space right on I'm a big UNC Tarheel basketball fan I like UNC Tar Heel football football in general but not at the same level as you can see I like the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers the Boston Celtics
 football recap cuz I don't really want to read a page about every single ACC football and so any sort of negative Duke stuff you can give me I'll take that too right so why can't we have a sort of take my preferences together and just give me the things that I'm that's relevant to me versus having to go out and read lots and lots of content just to get the little bit of information that I really need to think that the the Baseline level of skill of a journalist is going to just increase in complexity like as a journalist are you going to have to think about how to personalize your content in the future
 well I think they'll be any different flavors of journalist writing one of the things that I get asked about a lot is okay so now you're what stories have been automated I guess that means there's a human journalist any more ridiculous for anyone else to write another version of the story right which clearly that's not what happened today right to vote Trump says something in a controversial and different stories written about one topic try just because one person wrote about the topic doesn't mean no one else writes about it and so I think you know what you'll see is that you know they will continue to be more more automation driven in The Newsroom it'll be more types of stories automated but automation can't cover all the things that happened in the news
 you know those things still need to be covered by humans and will be for the foreseeable future so while they will continue to grow and importance I don't see that sort of just taking over and being exclusively what what happened to The Newsroom tests where you have to researchers rani's where they take an article that ran by human in an article turn by automated insights and they measure the differences between them what are like what were the types of conclusions that were drawn from those Texas studies what what were they give away is that something was an automated piece of content the the people taking test couldn't tell a difference and see how they were a straight up so is this automated and it was sort of 50/50 in a close close to that that people just couldn't pick out the difference
 but there were some some general things that came out of that were pretty consistent or more sexually-oriented are they were more informative or they were more believable even versus the human generator stuff would say they're more entertaining or you know what would have more elements that would in a more variety of the types of coverage that that would contain in NC all these are very true but this still the point was that they couldn't tell one from the other but I think those are pretty accurate in terms of the sort of key assets that you know automated content brings versus human you know actually Orion is going to be in a very short information-driven human or in his stories in are going to have more qualitative aspects to them
 so what are you working on in words with j what are the biggest engineering challenges that you have
 the biggest engineering challenges still aren't you know sort of that classic story of the hardest thing in the world is to make something that's easy to use and and that's that's our challenge for sure right it's a you know what we're trying to get to create a new environment for people that they've never seen it before you know how many cases that even know it existed before they even know they needed it but now they filed it and they're interested and how can we make it such that it's it's approachable and something that's easy to use and so that's something that you know I'm sure we'll continue to work on for the foreseeable future testing infrastructure or or just making the right product intuitions or serving or users what are the the techniques of those I mean as a is a product person you have a lot of tools in the tool called that you have to rely on some of them are we're just going to go in this direction
 yeah I'm not one to say that you listen to your customer for everything right it if we did that we've never would have built this thing to begin with because nobody ever thought about having a Wordsmith before and so this is something that we invented so that you know we have to kind of go out on a limb here but I think you use customer feedback for course correction right all right this this new onboarding approach that we took didn't didn't quite hit the mark and so we need to change it in some way hey let's talk to her our users with surveys and figure out you know what are the things that there are not enough for us because we have this other challenge of you know it in many cases were selling cars to people that have only seen horses before you know we have to make sure that the way that were communicating our value proposition on our homepage is is really well Define because people may come in with preconceived notions about
 story for me and they're going to be disappointed if that's what they're expecting you know without having done any work and so we have to make sure that we communicate properly got it okay well Robbie thanks for coming the show's been great conversation I'm really interested to see where where Smith goes and automated insights perfect but

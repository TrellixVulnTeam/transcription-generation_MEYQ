Transcription: 42 is a tuition-free developer School for students from ages 18 to 30 it was started by Xavier and Yale a French billionaire who wanted to encourage a new model of sulfur education 42 has campuses in France and Silicon Valley where did you as very high standards for the students that admits because the students that get in are not paying tuition but they have 24/7 access to high-quality computers and a beautiful campus unlike coding bootcamps 42 last three to five years student to graduate are equipped with both computer science theory and the Practical ability to see projects through on their own Brittany Burr is the Chief Operating Officer of 42 coding school in Silicon Valley and she joins the show to talk about how 42 works and the future of programming education at 42 the focus is on peer-to-peer learning students complete projects of Their Own

Britney beer is the CEO at 42 coding school Britney welcome to software engineering daily as well and today we're talking about 42 which is a tuition-free developer school with quite an interesting backstory quite an interesting model for training developers let's start with the idea of a coding school which of these were actually around in the first.com boom I've ever a little bit about how there was a boom and coding schools back then it didn't work so well just like every aspect of the internet and you know that the late 90s but in Web 2.0 we've seen this boom in coding bootcamps developer schools a lot of them seem very successful very useful
what are the pros and cons of the modern coding school model 42 different coding school different from some of the other schools that are you about what we do here at 42 is worth 3 to 5-year program so we're not focusing on teaching students very specific skills to then put them directly out onto the market in a very short amount of time a limited knowledge which will could become obsolete from one day to the next
carrot 42 what school is we have a three to five year program where the students go on the devil into various different projects and so actually when they first start off one of the last processes for selection for admission into r325 your program is for the PC and so it's a 4-week session where students are learning how to program in C language to start off with and this gives them the base is said they'll need to be able to go on and wear to an ever-changing code Market once they leave here at 4:30 to start the map in ceiling
computer is messing with your program python a ruby which 10 up to look a lot like when you look at some of the time and so in addition to that in a particular coating essentially copy and paste and get really good at knowing what functions using what situation you have to think about what they're doing with the computer option is to use the language and to copy and paste were actually teaching the students how to think how to think about
you're going from low-level language to high-level as the program erase the email it's 42 a continuous for a student I find that to be an interesting contrast between 42 and other coding bootcamps because a lot of the other coding bootcamps I've seen in interviewed they start with Ruby on Rails or JavaScript and I think part of the reason they do that is because if you start off with those languages people get excited they see how I can build a web page really quickly with this it's nice it's cool you know I changed one line of code and it makes this image disappear and makes his image of peer it renders a gift something cool like that and if you're starting with C it's more like the hello world you know slower lead time to satisfaction however
I can see that making complete sense because with 42
 it's it's tuition-free it's a nonprofit and your you don't have the goal of giving the students a pleasurable playground of you know if seeing things materialize into web pages in and feeling like oh I'm super powerful early on you're taking the long game approach and you know if a student can't handle the slower gratification of working with see maybe they're not right for 42 in the first place so I don't know if you knew this already but I had actually passed the 42 program when we were in Paris France where you can send pictures about 30 minutes
 have a letter with stripes on your screen once you're trying to just print out some of the string letters or when you're able to actually learn how to count and iterate through a string you're able to communicate with the computer and to be able to quickly actually from start of the PC to towards the end of the piscine as well you're being able to start screen as well so it is it's a different it's a different type of pleasure and what it is you see on the screen when I start studying
 pure science in in college and job as I would say somewhere between C and JavaScript in terms of its how much Tylenol satisfaction you can get out of the language from a few quick hits of it for me shortly hello world or iterating through a string was exciting enough to motivate me to continue working on computer science you've talked about piscine a couple times and I was researching 42in Gunner Standiford what does PC mean is it's the early the earliest process of the code education at 42 and it's I believe 4 weeks where you are in the computer lab 7 days a week so it's like 28 straight days of programming it's very intense what's the motivation for that intensity for that is super intense beginning phase of students who get in
 42 + Who start learning
 swimming pool very good motivation tattoo French billionaire philanthropist to finances that's cool so he asked you actually what was where she had come from and why would she know you didn't score high school dropout
 42 a Traditional School System connecting with the system or the not excelling in the system simply because that's not how they learn and they have an incredible amount of motivation I'm so changing from the kind of traditional we decided to opt for one would take an individual had done it in there or financial pain is so intense because
 is it something that they really want to be there I mean I remembered on my Thursday is a PC one of the girls she just doesn't know this is too hard it's too much of a challenge for me tell him I had here I am trying to solve the equation and so I think it's a really good way for us to also be motivated to follow through with the program especially because it is a program which is completely free free education education
 just coming to ask for the test and preview of what it's going to be in the coming during a 3 to 5-year program on Shahs of Sunset it takes a lot of hard work and you're going to have to put in the ass to get where you want to get spring framework gives developers and environment for building cloud-native projects on December 4th through 7th spring one platform is coming to San Francisco spring one platform is a conference where developers congregate to explore the latest Technologies in the spring ecosystem and Beyond

 DP scene is further down the funnel from the top of the funnel what's at the top of the final describe the screening process for the thousands of people who apply to go to 42 all different kinds of background we don't want to necessarily take in first grade in math can be completed by anybody can people that have been fired also computer programmers before that one
 for an individual that doesn't have that kind of background logical State of Mind First Step would be to enroll online on a mission site and then they would complete to logical test online so simple they don't test your English or your French level is simply to games that you have to play and persist with and then at the very end we have to see whether or not did you succeed did you demonstrate that you had the motivation that you had the person.
 and so that's the part that's easy to thrive in this type of learning environment and 30 years old and that's a very specific range why do you only take students who are between 18 and 30 years old the meaning in France until they have been particularly specializing for those years education that exist right after high school so directly from high school into the education system
 age limit in order for you set up at school and so when they had created for prior to 42 always had 18 to 30 and then so when we decided to come to United States we decided upon launching that we would stick to what we know and that was right out of high school education so and between the ages of 18 to 30 you have any personal beliefs about the biology that's going on in the brain between the years 18 and 30 or any reasons other than his your own historical experience with people who are 18 to 30 years old beliefs about nature and nurture that make that a ripe time for coding education about 13 order
 obligations are obviously going to have much harder to voting and the 15 hours a day to code on a daily basis especially during the day it's right now in trance we have a program going with unemployment 55 that have been unemployed for 2 years or able to come and do an accelerated program program because they already have other obligations in their life and so we've been doing that now for almost 2 years and so we're waiting to get the results back. See how well that is
 do we have any which way is very successful and with that we did something that was much more simplistic so rather than putting them through this we work with bruvion for the kids to school with high school students that are looking to prepare for the AP CSP exam will describe the curriculum for 42 so you start off with the piscine and it's a brutal four weeks of training do you just like sit people in front of computers and then have them run through stuff or is it like classes what goes on during the piscine and then what happens afterwards
 so what goes on during the speech scene is very different in the education so what that mean to computer they're whining about the project that they're going to need to work on and then they have the freedom to be as creative as possible within the confines of the subject to final solution that project-based learning important actually going into application until what happens and what we've heard from any of the different Employers in the industry is that they're very dissatisfied with the individuals that are coming out of the Traditional School
 and so one of the things that this particular type of program has been very successful for you to create an application generate thousands of phone numbers in one session where can I generate so you should maybe look into several students are going to know what their objective is and they're going to be able to come up and generator on solution for that
 example from the teacher and then going and doing it actually driving directly into the material itself it's kind of like when your baby you don't necessarily sit through and your parents start talking to you about the theory of paucity or gravity if you're not going to sit down and have courses about going to pick your morning after doing so that's one of the reasons why is project-based learning is so important because the students are directly learning through them the way that education of our modern education system has developed like public schools and even College a lot of it seems to be holdovers from
 the Industrial Revolution we're all of a sudden we had a lot of jobs where the description of the job was very well defined and what you're going to be doing on a day-to-day basis is very well-defined and that's still how some jobs are today but it's quite clear that the direction that jobs are going in his more creativity more autonomy and those jobs are not well the students who have been trained with the Industrial Revolution mentality are not well suited to those those creative jobs would you agree with that assessment physical object
 so very different word for Need for individuals that have technical competencies that are able to produce chemical Solutions forces able to go and work in the manufacturing Industries you touched on Theory versus practice now over a three to five year. The students are in 42 for 3 to 5 years that's enough time to learn both Siri and practice so like these coding bootcamps we talked about at the beginning those I think are more relegated to the Practical aspects and the modus operandi for them is if you learn how to do stuff practically the theory can be derived from your practical experience eventually I think that's true I think it's also true that you could learn
 theory and practice concurrently or you could learn theory first and then build practical applications on top of that how does the 42 curriculum represent or describe how the 42 curriculum represents the the tension between theory and practice or or how you teach both of them don't really know how does Siri go into the 42 Cricket obviously the scenes are going to have to advance on a project to start
 if you are building a product for software Engineers or devops Engineers consider advertising on software engineering daily there are 24,000 Engineers that listen to software engineering daily on a daily basis and if you got a product or a service that you would like to get into the ears of those developers would love to have you as a sponsor you can send me an email and Jeff at software engineering daily, and I'd be happy to tell you more about our sponsorship options and some of the success stories we've got many repeat sponsors like hired.com datadog mongodb amazon-web-services these are big companies that know how to Market to developers and they have their advertisements run on software engineering daily
 send me an email Jeff at software engineering daily.com or if you work at a company that you think should sponsor software engineering daily tell your manager and have them send me an e-mail thanks again to listening to the show and all the listeners who support the show by checking out the advertisements you are much appreciated now what's going on with this episode
 chocolate bit more about how the school functions in the absence of teachers are there people that are like experience that are wandering around cuz I've seen the pictures it's it's just like a big computer lab and people are just sitting at the computers working there collaborating with each other are there authoritative people who are walking around who can answer questions in addition to the student asking each other
 do you have to be reviewing in the projects as they are completed are being completed correctly and are progressing and horny through the use the computer lab are they going to be wandering around in those classes and responding to this question able to say I did that in Traditional School we have one person who holds all the knowledge and not one individual should be the one that we always go to what that looks like when we go into
 how many times individuals are going to come up on a problem opportunities are go off and work into the workforce from the beginning where they have a question into what happens with one day you are that supervisor turn to have a different solution and so rather than allowing them to remain on that stretch and to ask the one person that hold
 deflation that didn't really exist before hand so you're going to have to think about how to go about and previously students are autonomously learning though there's two of those groups and people helping out each other how do you enforce that the students are continuing to work and continuing to learn how do you make sure that there's not some student this just playing games on the computers all day or something like that school when you have a teacher in the classroom better laying on their phone to different levels
 2110 ensure that they were sitting there another utilizing every second in front of the computers truly working on their project that we want to or not necessary to babysit them what they need for success and then it's also one of the reasons why we test for individuals that are going to push themselves to be able to encourage yourself
 to advance much like you were going to move on prototypical student from 40 to walk me through the life cycle of what this kind of person is doing before 42 and how their life changes during 42 and what's like after so very hard to come up with a lot of different profiles recently to know who used to be a pizza delivery guy was working at the place for several years before coming here to 42
 printing out looking for an internship at some of these companies English teacher for several years and after 9:40 to grab manager in a tech company you have other individuals we have a gentleman and to Italian recipe before coming to forward to coming up at the end of History Department Spanish Masters in European studies and then I decided to 42 and now I'm here working at 42 any student that we have because we have to go
 things about to be able to create new programs in the future all of the same individual training out the same people as before so how would 42 impact individuals and change their mind always be able to argue that 42 of them arrive at that achievement so working all the time
 improv Club want to go on another location to go hear some experience and a very very type of credit typical you personally made the jump from having studied Spanish you say Spanish in American studies was it and did a masters in European studies history political science professor at University
 and so that's how I kind of heard about 42 I wasn't necessarily understanding what they were opening 42 or did you want to write the the next great novel or did you want to write literary Theory or did you have a long-term vision for what your career was going to look like when you got that education that was more in the arch of the literary Sciences
 thank you for a long time I had to reach in Spanish for a short time and then afterwards I thought I mean it's kind of been this big xploration of opportunities are available to me and what type of experience for me and when I found computer science I was like all of this is the this is the thing that I can use to unlock my creative potential the show me different directions I can go in with this education and I think other people share this experience that when you if you find out about computer side specially like late later on in life computer science program whatever you want to call it and I
 we became quite an evangelist for cuz I was like this is so cool more people should know about this I have all these creative friends who are struggling to find the right mix of of creativity and their work environment and you know I became an evangelist and just start telling them like this is the path to using creativity in the workplace you'll love it it was hard to convert people though and I see I still have friends that are a lot of friends who are struggling because their work is somewhat mechanistic but their impulses are creative or they grew up with creative impulse impulses maybe they've lost faith in those do you find that to be an experience that mirrors yours at all
 Spanx wear for me when I started driving and I thought this would be a different program to help other individuals learn languages better international relations keep talking in a foreign language so I saw a computer program help study what's the longer-term vision of 42 is it going to be a city on a hill that simplifies how other educational institutions should work or is it to just continue to expand to more campuses and Jerry more students give me a picture for the long term
 goals for more individuals especially here in the United States to vacation to be able to dive into the digital world easier to access sowa Market as well to work in some of these different tech companies to help us evolve as a society in this new digital world that we are entering in age do you think people should start to learn to code how early on like if you could map out the K through 12 curriculum where would you start the coating process
 you start out with I think it's different for each individual I mean obviously kids can start at an elementary school program I know there's different adventures with different characters educational programs you've seen that make you optimistic things other than 42 optimistic about coding schools the ladder the ladder though coating education more broadly that makes me enthusiastic about what is going on
 which is in San Francisco school which is focusing more on long-term is definitely a step in the right direction fishing stuff you've seen out of the students of 42 do they find themselves programming deep learning software or starting businesses what would a huge success stories you've seen
 can you beforehand to be able to go out and get a position as a senior software developer at instacart we have three individuals who were taken into the Lincoln Beach program as well we also have other students who to call Jay gravity where the students are mapping out Dark Matter on the computer screens where I have been working on a project squared sustainable Planters where these Planters could be able to test
 well Britney's been great talking to you about 42 I find the coding school to be inspiring and I wish you continued success
 we are partnering with indeed Prime to give you some tips on driving in the modern work environment today's set of tips is about how to create and grow your personal brand as a developer and this is important because the best offers often come to you from people who are reaching out to you not a situation where you are reaching out to the company so it's it's a good to have a personal brand because then people know about you and if they've got a great role for you they can just reach out to you and say hey you would be perfect for this role and then you're in a great position where you have a lot of Leverage
 it also helps you define yourself publicly so if you develop a personal brand for yourself then if you ever want to start a big project in the future you can refer back to that public Ledger of credibility that you have you can say oh I've done thing X Y and Z and that sums to my personal brand the personal brand is great to refer back to if you're trying to recruit people on your big project so how do you actually build that personal brand you obviously can start contributing to open source projects you can build up your GitHub repository history of contributions you can have your own portfolio or your own website or blog
 you can make YouTube videos you can tweet a lot of interesting things on Twitter and become an aggregator of sorts on Twitter you can give talks meet up so you can submit conference talks for these things you can often start small like a local conferences or meetups there's always interesting meetups around that you could probably submit a talk to and then people start to say hey who's that person who keeps giving that interesting talk on JavaScript performance I want to I want to have a conversation with that might want to have perhaps invite them to come work at my company could build a personal brand that way you can also do podcast setting up a podcast is very easy as a great way to build a personal brand
 you can find out how to work with people who are already known in the tech World there are lots of people who seem like big names because you see them on Twitter all the time maybe their CEO maybe they are the you know the head of a big open source project you still can be remarkably easy to access maybe you want to intern for that maybe want to volunteer for that maybe you just want to have a quick phone call with them by reaching out to these people and engaging with them you are going to to become that with that can help you build build your personal brand yourself because engaging with these people who already have a brand themselves helps you understand how and why they built their personal Brandon and you know often times they built that brand that personal Brandy and you like you recognize people I call Scott Hanselman like how did Scott Hanselman build that that brand around him that makes him Scott Hanselman diagnostic of
 Hanselman who works at Microsoft
 I think he built that by being subtle in his communication but his projects and his output speak for themselves that's true of a lot of the people who are most impactful in who have the the biggest personal brands in the software engineering community almost everyone who is successful markets themselves they they know what they're doing they know that their marketing themselves when they write that blog post or make that tweet or whatever and if they don't seem like marketers that's because they're doing it really effectively and they're delivering value in their personal marketing their personal branding so it doesn't really seem like marketing or Brandon cuz you're just like well this is great content that I'm consuming or this person made a great podcaster a great open source project and it makes you gravitate towards them so I hope this brief set of tips has been useful and if you if you like these tips or if you're looking for a job go to
 deed.com SE daily and you can check out indeed Prime which can help you find a better job if you don't like the job that you're currently in or maybe you don't have a job maybe you're you're just you just been relaxing and you're looking to get back into the job market indeed Prime makes it easy and I hope these tips will help you acquaint yourself better with the job environment as well thanks again indeed

Transcription: Docker is an open platform for distributed applications Docker allows for standardized container run times and will be an important piece of infrastructure for many years to come every software engineer is probably going to need to learn Docker but if you're new to Docker the technology can be confusing and intimidating what is a container why do I want to put my application in a container today's guest prakhar srivastava wrote a long tutorial explain to the fundamentals of Docker as well as a detailed explanation of how you can get started with Docker for car explains why do soccer is useful how Docker works and how you can get started before we get to that episode a few things software weekly is a newsletter that we put out every Sunday evening to condense what happened in the world of software over the previous week we would love it if you signed up and give us feedback on Arlen's of the world of software you can sign up for software weekly or join our slack Community which is also getting quite popular at

 prakash shrivastava is the author of Docker for beginners a comprehensive introduction for developers looking to get involved with doctor for car welcome to software engineering daily temperatures we're going to reiterate some Concepts that we have touched on in previous episodes and I think this episode will be a really great place to start for programmers who have not heard of Docker or and they haven't worked with it and it'll be a useful review for programmers who just have some exposure to the doctor but they don't really know how to use it so let's let's start with the obvious question what is docker
 good night okay so ago and it's the one I've been getting a lot of attention and I would say is is is a wave at you can automate your deployment of stock applications using containers and I think the key word here is his containers and note is that people that you would go good with the people who has in containers and so there was an update in the Western rewards reservation but I would say the dog make it popular operating system to help you understand why you would want to check out.
 Mighty Machines on my system and run DMV whatever your favorite position and then how do you say hi to setup multiple you know.. Rating systems running from top to bottom as well as what you can do is all of them share the canoe and the only provide something like the process isolation ale traits of the upside of this is that on my machine at my book Pro laptop I can.
 when was as good as a as running avoid washing machine belts like extremely fast and the good thing is that they provide a very flexible and very neat API is to do a function so I can put the volume of sharing mode volume is transfer data within the villain the containers of the API also there is a strength in the standardization of Docker and you've written about this right that the key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit Why does the standardization like how does that differ from how containers worked in the past and why is standardization so important
 right so I would say very honest division but it is part of the kinetic movement site survey illustrate the difference is that I say you have an application and it's a title application and you have and you have you make sure that all dependencies are Nike slip-on package of Jason code online but then you say you are using Amazon ec2 right you said Avenue Glenview you login you know install you said the operating system installed node dinosaur mongodb
 I know what if I send you a pic is no longer working production I just love the most common complaints that Oprah has that my machine and the problem is that you don't now ship that I saved your degree. What you do is your ship to expensive along with the entire operating system let's roll a D20 no right which probably is running inside of one too and that's what you have so now you don't have any such Persian of dependency letter say some African version dependencies not turning on my machine but it falls on shipping code in or shipping
 and then Santa Claus on everything in one Sunrise unit and that's where you can reply so the sanitize part is basically is that so you don't have no other container location services so now they're Cuda kubernetes and that you can use these containers and the application so this is where the great and we had virtualization for a long time and virtualization is in some ways similar to containerization you know you think about shipping an entire operating system often times in the past that would mean you virtualize entire operating system it's like you know I know when I got started at several companies you know the way that I would on board with the company is the company would deploy a VM to be assigned to me in the DM would come with all of my other things that I needed how does how does a container compared to that like what what is what is new about containers
 makes it more efficient than the virtual lies premise Right image on a graph on I think. And that's what are the differences so horsepower rating system Academy Mac OSX and windows what you do we basically you set up a hypervisor in this condition is emulated Buy washer box and then all this guest operating systems sit on top of it right so now you deserve it looks like this so imagine on top of each other Midwest pancake is yourself on top resides your host operating system which in my case letter says Mac OS X and then you have stacks of independent
 isolated washing machines I need directions to bring his own best operating system that their own boundaries they have their own unless they have their own card are all the commands rate that pancake rocks and broker is quite different so is the dog a service basically the container service what does it's shared a diagonal amongst all these applications but it was processed isolation so that you have someone process is I should forget about this site if you said you're taking some schools or even just running application process it's not easy but it's impossible to see a python application with one v share something with you
 USB memory that is being used by another process in Savannah next provide the nation as a container so now you have its own operating system and that's very what should I say the efficiency gains from libraries and the cat Commander the docker Docker service at the. I think the doctor Damon cast with the hypervisor like I think I think we dive into that a little bit can give us an idea of how like how we're getting better economies of scale with with with Docker vs. virtualization so the docker Daemon is this background service running on the host and manages the docker containers he gets them
 does isolation like you said get some more detail on the responsibilities of the doctor service the doctor Damon and how it works
 okay so it's of the basically sorts of broken even has a lot of other things to write and the keep I would say the advancement is which provide this or container or an isolation is is called it is basically was initialized or by I think OK Google Engineers are not sure your contact call c groups and that's what allowed glass containers to buy for isolation and so don't think it's an old Bean you going to say something else I'm not sure of the exact featuring example responsible for managing controlling images for talking with the containers is the T groups
 getting into the discussion of how we use Docker and how we from the developers perspective we should Define the term Docker image so what is a Docker image and how do I build a Docker image in what am I doing with that Docker image images is a snapshot of your of a parabola state in in a container right so think about it so they understand now if you want to use of the point right
 Ubuntu and on this image is basically the best describes tobacco resin how you can set up your 5 system and how to build using images right so don't start navigation and I want to start a container using this image to do is basically and use it like a stand-alone VM or any Automotive in to install libraries in salt content writing everything YouTube on Saturdays in Detroit so so we talked about this initially mean there's no you have anyone to him and I could use all of that I know you want to
 I know I can call this my fancy chat application and doesn't know anybody who wants to know you don't have to install anything don't have install node.js they don't have to install more when they don't even need to have anything on the machine I just need to have the doctor's appointment which is worse to be functioning and then using this thing up and running
 so this is one good thing about it but we might argue about this day seems like a lot of work right and that's true so it is that I didn't deploy no justification of doing it so it's so common so people have images on which all of the largest image and there may be a bison image on Michigan download it has almost everything set up for everything you need to do is just copy copy of code for me local machine to the container and then and you're done I've been told I do they can operate almost like a git commit history so explain
 thanks so sad about it right so you have lettuce image which is an operating system and you install 1/3 dependencies the music image 2K so I use an image to create a note this application and the application so I think of you every single time if you look in the toilet fill out the application text it take 750
 where does Alexa Vega snapshots like a comedy show in your court what did she do you write code and then coming to take snapshots at this point everything is working and the kind of side work until this point I can share the same and some from back of the from that, Don Words Their history the 33 star to the right so then to be are you coming to his basic can you add stuff to your birthday mr. Certain point and then you just started breaking into a fork and when you add a note j7 disease and I think this is so now we have this birthday Cheryl Burton Cummings Center Commons 20 minutes to get from a bare-bones won't notice application and you don't dangle Duncan Tim doesn't remember all of that and so that's where the shavings the Savings in terms of in terms of the size of this comes up
 back in time and say okay so I installed this version of data saved imagemagick which is a key difference but I want to go back to a previous date and you can just do that thing that you had your meeting changes in the tub is this registry of Docker images can I use Docker Hub to pull down images and compose and tire applications from those images exactly exactly the point of alcohol is basically Good Hope for images right so the way you do that is you and is basically cut into kind of a message so when are the official bills which is supported by The Rocker by the faucet okay so what they do is they making sure everything's up to date
 security prefixes and it lost dog have also does other users like me and you probably to share our images so for example if I want to create a flask application settings really cool and my friends so I can reply that image on Enchanted image on Docker Hub and they just need that one come on basic you to put it down and don't start running on the machine Docker files what is a Docker file a lien to election something very beginning so is basically a set of commands that how you get from state-to-state be in an image
 so you have a set of steps that I want to install turn time I want to install npm I want to install mongodb and probably some applications with his teammates you might somehow leave the company leave the team and other you can but the idea behind if you can just write down the steps as a sin tax rate of which the belko side as a set of steps what allows your kid a new image remember the pain
 you go to get to write and your check out this very cool project Club another project you want to and diko basically open source you if you want you can what I can do as you can and you just run. And that's it all the steps you need to build a Docker image from scratch that idea other people and they can get the same container container of a few steps to compose an application of multiple Docker container so how do I get these communicate with each other right and you
 police small certain kind of images that are very small applications one. But yeah but if you're running things separately you want some more communication right using network is allows your applications to set up networking between containers start or run Docker container and he said the time in this network Windows 8 is it allows a bridge between these containers when they can't talk while using an IP
 application so you don't have to remember IP address is you don't have to remember Laura consecration you just said that and whenever you invite me in a in a network then there's the horse that I can call to lucky for you and that's so basically you get containers Corporation what are some best practices for how we should divide or applications in two different Docker containers so the best practices I am I'm sure but but let's try to say your application consist of or should I say
 find me to do it is you have everything in one container and you done it but but the problem is so if you want to have lettuce if I have containers that you're happy and you have a good chunk of traffic company website then it's just make sure that the data is in one constant location based stain later but what you do is you can have one second service containers running elasticsearch service
 elastic plastic containers so it sounds like you just answer the question of why Docker is often associated with the term microservices yeah so it's oh yeah right so that's a good Segway so I think you don't and you don't want everything to be on one monitor application running with services with Theresa and Tire customer base what do you want to wish you understood this independently problem in different languages by one team so you have probably one team which is running rich is running some music
 you can use containers which which is said and done on a machine have its own they're definitely ways and their ways to have one machine done multiple containers so many containers are how do I make sure that I'm using my machine right effectively machine you can definitely have multiple containers and then they're different tools that you have received this Cardinal how they work as a single pole quest
 yeah we have an upcoming show that is going to touch on Docker swarm so we don't need to worry about that too much but you have right now docker-compose and multi container Docker applications to become easier with docker-compose what is docker-compose fixes agricultural but allows you to set up an application so sorry about last step equation and you want to make sure that these two matching bookcases but anytime you want to make sure that one of them both of them should be up at the same time it should not be that your container Corp
 that means that you can specify at home I talk application how much do some applications this is the configuration for this and it sets up the entire set of containers the application everything been different documents what is the entire application which can all decompose 5/6 continue using one command
 that's right the benefit ride absolutely good use Docker and a high-level what are the steps do you take the reader through in this tutorial teaching Docker right so I'm currently a student at Columbia and I took a class assembly on Cal Computing and all of her students and what are you so I have I have had something of an experience working with the bring some I can see that some of my most of my colleagues really struggling so they were used to running at beginning of system on the machine but when it came to the latest news on
 MBS Automotive Artistry lotion there's a new system and the point I saw that this to people who don't have any expertise with managing the next match in containers managing p.m. and then and it could eventually lead to some sort of vacation that he is coming up and running and I would say most of the stuff that I do and I think so and so. And that's where I came in and I wrote this so it's getting back to the original question this guy starts is is the Golden Lamb basically is that if you start running from the start to the finish your thought you would have to know for container
 Buckeyes applications running on the cloud on AWS that you can share with your friends so it goes through a series of steps from the next story of how everything works and it starts at building step by step sober so I thought we start with the bank and run multiple, I can probably do it on the container and said everything is going to work fine start with a static website witches images kidding around. And then deploy movies on us it's very simple application
 navigate to first page then lastly we covered because I feel like that's all applications they have multiple components does hunting application Play Somewhere Between and that's where I felt that a multicultural environment would be useful and that's what I listed how we can build an application called beside call DSS food trucks mapping application which where you can search for good food good food to eat in San Francisco right at the bank and to provide you with your search so it's the best application again and it to power a success and I used to make sure to let us know how we can build and manage application
 irritating is one of the highlights of this is Baby Depot all of this to be continued service and we make sure and so I can get the feel of it tomorrow they have a project or any such a case for a better tutorial when people can really engage with the material and then have something to show for it at the end where they're like yeah I built this and it was really cool and and now I feel like I can bootstrap that to other projects so that's really well what what are the aspects of Docker that you find frequently confuse people
 are the icing Ravena should last text about images and containers right and people don't exactly know what exactly is an image can I download image what is a container can I talk about something still not a lot of people are unaware of and that's bad for production what I've read online and would have spoken of your friends is that still running back rice applications which consists of like under the container is still not assault problem that still does the good news is that deserve to live in the day and night at 11:40 o'clock but there's a lot of open questions and best practices that I still need to be sort of this is how we run big Market application how do you enter them how do you make sure that they are working fine logs security security
 sentence that provides as much isolation as running fever gems in there some issues with an and lastly I think some of it has been recently released in August 3rd birthday was running Docker on Windows and Mac so before that happened the way you were supposed to run a Docker container on a Mac or Windows is that you supposed to trim the bushes box box and then you can until a few months ago and then now you can run fully native containers in the next and in Mac OS X and not Windows as a no and you can books
 which I think as of now has been a little bit complicated
 yeah so I'd love to talk about some of the slightly more advanced topics around Docker of a scheduler what is the scheduler
 okay so scheduler at a very high level from an operating system point of view is basically a demon or something like that schedules all this abuse abuse time to go to manage right so you have my boss and his running and its leaves between processor to make sure you have a process and operation which can be Network weight of these things take different orders of magnitude of time when Edward called might be orders of magnitude slower than the system should I have been a good processor in process on your ring system and asking for Network then rather than starting making an application making the process of making process weight and operating system what does tamale process for example to some of the process to make sure that by some other process
 come into his job very fine job of making sure that the CPU PlayStation is as much as high as possible and 11 and going to an even higher level of these different schedulers that have a tire companies or products built around them these things like ECS and May shows and Cooper net and the D unit of atomicity that many of the schedule is uses the container to you know with when they think about like wow okay how are what are we scaling up and allocating resources to show what is new about these types of schedule is how does how does a scheduler on the level of a distributed operating system dealing with containers how does it differ from the traditional type of operating system level scheduler
 right okay so somebody I just might keep you in sight system and that's why you have to share right but you have machines in that scenario what are you do is so let's talk about everything you have been running a company and you have this big database of lettuce a logs that you're correct I know you want to run some a little jobs on this now if you right and you're good luck way to solve the problem when you don't respond Legacy 1010 systems it can be a container. It can be a VM and no job and within you tired okay I have this
 and I want to run this many jobs right and then to the scheduler sticks in and then it has to make sure but I said you would my jobs on these workers on these customers of the book of every what when where and how these are orchestrated on Manitou that I can utilize my resources efficiently. Obviously if your man is very big company right you have the steam of you make sure if I'm doing my job it should not be together everybody else is halted can be so certificate and I just happen to other kinds of so what do you want to do now is why you want me to buy some other user to make sure that my secrets are Tyler and I'm your everything as much as I can today is such as of now
 this coming to picture of nature that the way you have a scheduling open in the process of abstraction and management at the one Machine level you're not doing that for the Metro machine the cross tarot classes so you manage that one machine and it takes all day so you should be the job based workflows I think there's also I did the show at kubernetes recently and kubernetes is interesting because in the writings about it the Google Google to develop kubernetes they talk about how in the past before kubernetes or far before her nose there is there were these two systems babysitter and job queue or something and basically there are two types of applications at Google which are you know this batch jobs that you just talked about and then there's the long-running user applications like what I access my Gmail
 Nitro FX I'm spitting up a container somewhere on Google infrastructure that's long-running you know it's going to it's going to live for for you know some undetermined amount of time until I take one of the interesting Promises of these distributed container systems is that you have a layer of infrastructure that takes care of thinking about scheduling things to to both bats jobs and these long-running jobs because they take different types of resource sets
 okay right right that's right yeah so anyway what's in the future for the docker ecosystem what do you see coming forward
 right I think for me I'm most excited by the latest acquisition of the frosting right a cigar bunch of five nights of your tracking so I think the project name is open so it doesn't show me the folks from the thing but what were required by doctor and I think that a very KIRO to play on the native to system definitely love to see what the dr. has in plan as far as a so I think the company has one to two changes when is getting one more example even the University of the containers of the container movement about how everything is going on. I think there is a good folks on make it as easy as possible for people to get a charge of a dog and I think
 as far as I'm concerned recent acquisitions going to definitely be a long step forward not setting up voicemail box not having a big download anything in this type of wood is a lot of I would say using station and tunic require to make sure that I should have. It is something that you can't deploy in production to manage your very very big applications so is that oh. So it is good for running small Dural applications for running your mini project but when it gets down to the countries of containers then you have actually big thing on your hands and not off open questions on how to get on those issues and how to monitor and so I think that side and search occasionally how that nature. Lepow needs to go is there
 play something that I'm excited about the movement of Ocean Communities system and then all the big one with all the big table with sharing your images on a private account but you don't have to pay that is privacy security whatever and let's see how to make a very cool and the way it makes belly management of developing and managing applications it's effectively it's fun to work on
 you mentioned that you're at school and that the class that you took around cloud computing and some people who are somewhat confused should should school be teaching container technology or I mean it sounds like it's if the people were already confused and containers weren't even involved maybe containers are would be going too far but I mean certainly there's a point where schools should be teaching Docker just like they teach python or get so when do we get to the point where school should be teaching docker
 I ain't I so understand if I don't know why she was there two cans of Plasti Dip at least one kind of classes that you take a computer fundamentals class right so they can be your algorithms closet systems for networks and in Mike in that case it might make sense to do something as advanced as Alexa containers but again from not from I would say an application for the view right and so if it gets around holiday advancements in Japanese system and how is the moving where can I buy technology computer science programs are required to be sold who has containers and what something interesting from a certain point of view but teaching them Dockers or something so application-specific might be a bit. I am not sure that is required I think either as a as a student and things I had The Phantom Menace from the biggest I said that I've taken a matter of being aware so the class that I took
 Amazon glass which aims at teaching teaching his concerts and that is why something like this could be useful but I know that something as something as application-specific like darker should be apart that's what I feel things I've received a long ways people really like that they have depart something on the cloud and which is what the site was missing from a lot of Orioles and respect is so you could have said are able to set up Google containers and run of machine from what I heard is something you can get up and I don't know I think that's where my support and it sent it walks through each and every step
 carefully on how we can get screenshots with everything I think it's sort of thanks for coming out the software engineering daily it's been a real pleasure talking to you and I think your doctor darker tutorials awesome I'll definitely put the show notes anybody learning Docker should check it out yeah I guess so much more music

Transcription: note is one of the most successful advertising technology companies in history after building a business from measurement of a depression was sold Oracle for $850 advertising Powers the free content on the internet measurement makes it easier for Publishers to monetize their content at software engineering daily we know this from first-hand experience the podcast ecosystem has barely any ability to measure success and that can make it very hard to entice advertisers in podcasting it is very difficult to understand if an advertising campaign is a success because the data feedback loop is not as tight as it isn't display advertising why a moute is important improving the analytics on Advertising helps Publishers and helps Brands it helps ad agencies and helps add tech companies decide how to allocate their capital
why is it hard to measure advertising success why is this a difficult engineering problem because there are so many players in the space with conflicting incentives a brand wants to show ads to people who will buy a product a publisher wants to display an ad that will maximize Revenue ad tech companies and ad agencies want to take the biggest cut possible from the transactions between Brands and Publishers in the midst of all of this fraudulent traffic providers offer cheap services that drain money from anyone who is not keeping a close eye on their dealflow
in this fog of War most goals to provide transparency where possible mote CEO Jonah goodhart joins this episode to talk about advertising analytics viewability and fraud if you like this episode we've done many other shows about ad Tech and advertising fraud you can check out our back catalogue by downloading the software engineering daily app for iOS where you can listen to all of our old episodes you can easily discover new topics to my interest you you can up vote the episodes that you like and you can get recommendations based on your listening history with 600 episodes It's hard to find the episodes that appeal to you and we hope that the app helps with that
who do you use for log management I want to tell you about scalar the first purpose-built log management tool on the market most tools on the market utilize text indexing search and this is great for indexing a book for example but if you want to search logs at scale fast it breaks down scaler built their own database from scratch and the system is fast most of the searches take less than a second infected 99% of the queries execute in less than a second that's why companies like OkCupid and giphy and Careerbuilder use scalar to build their log Management Systems you can try it today free for 90 days if you go to the promo URL which is software engineering daily.com scalar s c a l l y r
that's software engineering daily. Com scalar scalar was built by one of the founders of rightly which is the country that became Google Docs and if you know about Google Docs history it was quite transformational when the product came out is this was a consumer-grade uy product that solve many distributed systems problems and had great skill ability which is why it turned into Google Docs and so the founder of Riley is now turning his Focus to log management and it has the consumer-grade you why it has the skill ability that you would expect from somebody who built Google Docs and you can use scalar to monitor key metrics you can use it to trigger alerts with pagerduty and it's really easy to use it's really lightning fast and you can get a free 90-day trial by signing up at software engineering daily. Com
/ scal why are software engineering daily.com scalar and I really recommend trying it out I've heard from multiple companies on the show that they use scalar and it's been a real differentiator for them so check out scalar and thanks descaler for being a new sponsor of software engineering daily
 Jonah goodhart is the CEO of moat analytics Jonah welcome to software engineering daily thanks Jeff thanks for having me so today we're going to talk about a variety of angles on the Internet advertising world and I want to start from the top down and eventually get into the engineering stuff but at the high-level there are two kinds of Internet advertising there's direct response advertising and brand advertising so we could break these down into more granular verticals but direct response is the type that you hear on podcast add so you hear inter promo code X and you get a discount and this is easier to track because of this direct call to action that gives attribution to an ad in display advertising when an ad appears the call to action is usually to click but there's also brand advertising where the advertiser is just paying to put the ad in front of some eyeballs
 YouTube online advertising is brand advertising it's a great question it's a number that's been getting bigger and bigger with every year I think when we started back in 2010 the split was something like 2/3 or even 70% direct response think about things like Google search which is predominately direct response driven you search for something very specific you take immediate action you click on the add you go to the site you do something ran ever tizing traditionally is really what's made up advertising it's been television it's the ads for the Super Bowl it's Pepsi ads Coke ads PNG add so on and so forth and I think over the last bunch of years we've seen a pretty rapid increase of brand dollars into digital I think like you described it's a really hard problem when you think about how do you track success I think the thing that I that I try to remind myself is that the vast majority of purchase behavior in the US on retail products is offline
 so while most of us have accounts for things like Lyft and Uber and seamless web and open table and all these great things that we can use that to buy things online 90-plus percent of all retail transactions in the u.s. still happen offline so what that means from advertising perspective is that if you were a brand and you're trying to reach people and they're not going to take some immediate action and you're going to buy the product and the offline World there exists this this Gap what we call a measurement Gap and that's really what we tried to set out to to understand but it's exactly that transition from the internet being largely composed of direct response advertising to incorporating brand advertising in a big way I think that that lettuce to that the interesting times that were in right now can we say with any evidence that brand advertising works or is this kind of almost like a religious belief
 no I think we can say with hard evidence to Brand advertising works for example if you look at at television the entire television medium has been based on but I'm really brand advertising the largest portion of advertising on TV and when you ask a brand how do you measure success for brants right for it for something that is not bought immediately for something that's not an impulse purchase what brands will tell you is as you go through a pretty scientific exercise where you look at two markets you spend money advertising on television X as an example in one market you turn it off in another Market that looks demographically similar to the first and you look for sales left difference it's another words in the market where you had ads running did more people buy your product and if they did the ideas that you can do a causality study to link that difference to the advertising it's the media that you bought so I would say empirically yes we are very comfortable and confident that brand advertising works I think in digital people are a
 questions about well okay does that mean that it works all the time everywhere on every site and every format on every mobile app what about if the ads on part of the screen what about if he has never on the screen what about if you can see it but you can't hear it I think all of those components come into into question and digital that didn't exist in the same way and other mediums and so I think there are new questions that we are asking in digital that are critical to understanding brand advertising effectiveness
 explain what the term you ability means you had a great question viewability is dead simple it just means that you bought an ad that somebody had a chance to see it if you went to Times Square in New York City and bought a billboard your expectation would be quite simply that somebody walking through Times Square can see you're at that's it right so if you ability it's just the idea that somebody the intended potential person has a chance to see the ad that you bought well that's pretty simple in television that means that the ad ran in the newspaper it means that I got printed in a magazine same thing what about an internet well I got a little bit more complicated because if you go to a webpage on your computer or on your phone and you don't scroll all the way down as an example there might be an ad that somewhere on the page that you don't get to that never physically shows up on your screen and therefore is impossible to be seeing is not viewable yet somebody is bought it and so the challenge in digital is that you have this interesting dynamic
 how Pages have been design and how ads lots of peer where there's not really a consistent way that that adds are shown to his results some pages have one or two ads some pages have 20 as some pages have an infinite number of ads and so you get to this place where an Advertiser might pay for a bunch of ads on a page that the person ever scroll down to and none of those ads are viewable on our view is if Dad's not there then then it probably had no value for the for the marketer and so that's cubility became a really big issue and digital where I think it's not been as big of an issue in another mediums you said that half of the ads on the internet are actually not viewable why is that how did we get to this place where the infrastructure of the ads ecosystem across the internet produces a world where half of the ads are not viewable yeah great question I think I think part of it is that the internet was not designed think about how a different one web page
 it looks to the next think about how different one app what's the next your favorite social media app looks very different from your favorite email app for search app or whatever else you have in your phone and so if you think about the way that design functions in other mediums ads are pretty consistent most newspapers look and feel the same most newspaper presentation of ads you have a full-page ad a half-page at a quarter page ad in television you have 15 and 30 second commercials and they run for 8 minutes of of a lot of time during a 30-minute piece of content there's a lot of consistency in other mediums if you think about digital what's the size of an ad well it depends what is an abnormally look like well that depends too sometimes they're big Spencer small sometimes they have images attached to and sometimes there just text sometimes there you know almost advertorials call native advertising sometimes that take up the entire screen snows they have video animation so has they've audio soon as they don't there's not the same level of consistency and digital and so what happened is if you go back I
 visual about 20 years ago to go back about 25 years ago in the first Banner ad was run somebody put up that first dad and somewhat of a random size 468 pixels by 60 on a web page and said that's what's an advertisement is going to be on online and it was one of the first online advertisements from their people began to add different sizes different formats but there was never a consistent sort of what's all sit down and figure this out together I don't know if that would have been possible given how the internet should have olives in and showed it grows on its own but none the less there was no system there was no sort of consistent approach for this is how it works and we got to a place where there are I would argue no rule so you can put up a web page if you want to have 10 ads on your webpage accept any has anyone page if you want to have big ones small ones if you want to have them y'all banner ads going to have none of them be banner ads you can do literally whatever you want and it's not to say that you don't have that kind of flexibility and other mediums it's just other mediums are much much much more consistent
 television is very very consistent you don't have 9 second ads in 3 second ads and some ads that are on half the screen the same as that are on 3/4 of the screen you just have TV commercials by and large that are 15 or 30 seconds and that's 90% of Television advertising that the mass of market and so the lack of consistency I think in digital led the issues I think there's a second thing to happen which is that as programmatic advertising got popular people realize that if you add another add tag to your webpage you get paid and so now she went incentives enter into the world of digital advertising well if I get paid for adding another add tag to my page what am I going to do well I might add more add tax until somebody says will hold on a second nobody's actually seeing any of those ads quickly the ones at the bottom of the page maybe we won't pay for them and US enter the world and challenges of viewability but this was something that evolved over the last 20 or so years
 you're the CEO of moat analytics which measures web and mobile ad Impressions and content to use give a brief overview for how Motor Works yeah absolutely well first of all so I'm the CEO of mote and mode analytics is one of our one of our products but as a company what we do is we fundamentally do two things we provide analytics information data to help marketers and Publishers make decisions about whether consumers are seeing their ads whether they're paying attention to them and whether they're awesomely driving outcomes and we also provide intelligence if you go to mote. Com there's a free search engine that's been around for now about 6 years that has many of the creatives of many of the World brands and so if you type in any brand in the moat., you can easily find creatives for just about any major brand out there and it gives you a quick way to get intelligence get information on what people running with ads look like what creative looks like so honest
 4th and so we have these two worlds what we call intelligence and analytics and in practice we are in the business of helping people make smarter decisions when the business of helping marketers like Procter & Gamble at Unilever Nestle make smarter decisions about what media they buy where they buy what creative Works what types of platforms work best for their offers and at the same time we're helping Publishers helping companies like NBC and fox and Snapchat another's figure out how do they reach consumers that are on their platforms with the best type of of advertising and how do they measure that they're seeing it in and paying attention so it's a pretty important function we think that really sits in between both advertisers and Publishers and tries to add value on on both sides
 you have a software project that you want to build everybody does I love building products but I know more about how software fits together then how to actually write the code itself I don't spend a lot of time writing code but I do like to build software that's why I use top towel top tall is the best place to find reasonably priced extremely talented software Engineers to build your projects from scratch you can get a pair of Apple airpods when you use top towel.com SE daily to work with an engineer for at least 20 hours and I recommend it I think it's a great way to build your projects if you don't have time to build them yourself there's a misconception that Engineers have to build all of their own project just because they're capable of doing that it's not true
 top towel has only the top 3% of developers they turn away 97% of the developers that apply to work on the top tell platform and that's how you get a matching process unlike anything else I've seen in the freelancer marketplace and I've tried a lot of different freelancing platforms top talent has such high quality engineers and they listen through the design specification do you have the hand pick the perfect developer for your project and this is save me countless hours in my development process is really nothing that compares to top Talbot I have seen so you can get a free pair of Apple airpods when you try top tell at top tell.com SE daily find an engineer that's going to help you build your side project and get your MVP off the ground

 absolutely so brief history about what I have observed in an online advertising I did some work at an advertising company 3 or 4 years ago and my early Impressions just getting involved with it and starting to see how much fraud there was how many problems there were to become really cynical and basically be like oh my gosh you know this just bought traffic everywhere and these large companies are getting completely bilked and brand advertising across the internet must be a mistake because it's just such low-hanging fruit for fraudsters and to some degree that assessment is true it still is true today but on the other hand some of it does work some of it must work it because you know I know I see add to cross the internet I know advertisements affect me but there's this huge question about which adds are working when people see it
 and which adds are even making their way in front of people I've had further confirmation advertising Works since I started this podcast which is ad-supported and I know from first-hand experience talking to advertisers that oh yeah actually working getting a first-hand experience for it and really getting my my hands into it and understand the advertising actually does fulfill a needed role but on the other hand I've done a lot of coverage over the technical aspects that enable advertising fraud and some of the techniques that people have employed to pull off complex fraud schemes and if you know that serve provokes my cynicism once again to keep an open mind to this stuff but I don't know what I'd love to hear your contemporary views on how prevalent advertising fraud is how it affects the internet
 yes it should two things Wilson packet of it so first of all advertising fraud is absolutely real we call it invalid traffic and there are all forms of it both should have purposely done decorated fake traffic people who have written scripts to generate traffic to a web page which has ads on it that they somehow a profiting from that is is frauded some would say that's criminal many would say that's criminal actually and I think that's a real issue and it's being addressed by lots of different folks and and considering she's in the industry there's also by the way invalid traffic that is simply Bots Google has a barcode Google bot the biggest pot probably on the internet that crawls around the internet and and generates effectively fake traffic but it's tracked in such a way is that you take it out of your reporting to take it out of your analytics to take it out of your results and there's lots of good Bots that go around the web and collect information in a way that's that's helpful so one thing to recognize is that not all that generated traffic is
 is that in fact some of its good and some of it we rely on in our in our daily lives for that the part of it that's bad the numbers that we see it's something the magnitude of about 4% so somewhere around 4% of digital advertising is not human is not real and is pretending to be real and as a result is costing about 4% of dollars in the industry and if you look at our industry is 170 billion dollar industry it's about 7 billion dollars right so it so that's a real number the association of national advertisers says in 2016 the losses were just about that 7.2 billion dollars that's a heck of a lot of money and it is an issue that we should all be paying attention to that said viewability as a related sort of topic is a 50% issue of all the ads are not viewable and so when we look at those to view abilities I order some magnitude bigger in terms of challenges that that we need a software what we generally say it
 is you want to reach human and viewable of course you want to you want to have a human being that has a chance to to see your ad and only if you have a human being that has a chance to see your ad will the add have a chance to be effective now there's some controversy around the ability which I think is fair because people are asking questions about the definition right what is the definition of a viewable add does the entire ad have to be on the screen what if 99% of the ads on the screen should that not count does it have to be there for a second or two seconds but if it's there for you know 1.9 seconds as opposed to two seconds all of those things matter and I think there's a healthy debate happening but I think what everybody agrees is yes you have to reach a human being and they have to have a chance to see the ad for the potential to be effective I want to go back to a statement you made earlier about does advertising work and you were saying some of your experience that you've seen the of course that advertising does work I'd remind that the viewers that advertising after all is storytelling that's whatever time
 advertising is simply telling you a story just like we tell stories about other things but it's a paid story and it's a paid story that has it has a goal it's meant to instill some sort of trust and belief that the consumer will be interested potentially in and making a purchase or and checking out a particular product and so what I would tell you I should have a simple example of Storytelling and advertising that works one of my favorite examples is movie trailers movie trailers are at right there ads for movies which are paid and they're encouraging a person to go make a purchase go out and see a movie download the movie but somehow transact on a movie and the way that people are encouraged to do it is by seeing clips that are put together in a 15 second 30-second excetera trailer and so from my perspective advertising can be great advertising can help point us in in the directions that that we want to go and it has the opportunity
 play to in a positive way influence our society what I would what I would argue is that it has endpoints are Society in a very big way most of the big brands that most of us know about in the US at least and this probably changes someone market-by-market put in the u.s. brand advertising television advertising has been a staple of our society for a while now a lot of us myself included at 8 at night on a Monday or Thursday we don't sit down and watch TV anymore and so as our activity has shifted towards digital towards our phone towards our devices so goes and so must go the advertising and so what's happened at a macro level is that advertising Works Brandon Works storytelling works but we're shifting away from watching TV and they scheduled program 2-way like we used to by the way the number of of scripted series that are created every year is up over the last couple years you mount a TV content is being created as up so we're in a great place from a TV content consumption
 perspective and we're consuming more and more video content than ever we're just not doing it in traditional in 08 8 p.m. must see TV Primetime kind of ways and so as that behavior of shifts to digital powered environments to consume video on content still goes with that advertising and I guess from our perspective is less about does advertising work we know it works the question is how does it work better what's the right way to do it in one environment what's the right kind of consumer that you want to reach what are the right metrics that you should use to judge success and how do you ultimately do that in an efficient way so that you know you are you're spending your money to get the most bang for the buck and I think that's really what what most all about can you explain the 4% number you mention that 4% of traffic on the Internet is bought how did you come to that conclusion yeah for 4% of dollars spent is the is the approximate number so the association of national advertisers which basically represents the top
 advertisers in the United States so I think any major Advertiser in the u.s. is part of this group they did a study and they came back from the study and said 4% of of a dollars go to to non-human traffic to to add fraud something along those lines that equates to about 7.2 billion dollars was there quote we come out mote comes out with quarterly benchmarks where we tell our clients what percentage of the media that you bought or if your publisher what percentage of the ad Impressions on your site where non-human were invalid and that percentage ranges from about 1% to 45% depending on the format depending on was it mobile in-app video was it desktop display was it directly bought forces programmatic excetera excetera but that the sort of order of magnitude range is a couple of percent that we see from our data and it happens to coincide with the numbers that this trade Association came out with
 what are the techniques do you use to disambiguate a human from a bot yeah great question so there's a group called the media rating Council and the media rating council is a essentially an oversight group they were were put in place at the best of Congress about 50 years ago to have oversight over measurement companies and what they do is they they essentially look at your technology they look at how you do measurement and they ensure that you're following the right practices that it's reliable that it's accurate and specifically with Bots they have laid out a framework for how they believe measurement companies in there for the industry should think about tracking box and what they talk about is two types of traffic they talk about General invalid about traffic or general invalid traffic where they called givt and sophisticated invalid traffic or sivt the difference between the two
 who is General and dollar traffic as an example is the IP address that the person came from is attached to a data center which is doesn't have human beings that sit inside of it it's a virtual Data Center and therefore we know with a high degree of confidence that it's not human beings coming millions of hives from that data center that it's it's a computer system that's generating that that traffic that would be considered General invalid traffic sophisticated invalid traffic is much harder to detect and you're using a lot of different signals you using signatures profiles if you will of what box look like and so you're learning over time based on looking at a lot of traffic and we've had the fortunate position at mote to be able to have a lot of the biggest Publishers and advertisers leverage our platform so we get the benefit of being able to see a tremendous amount of data on both sides including for example when somebody is logged in on a legitimate site where we know this is this is highly likely a real user
 and then we can look at traffic from a suspicious source and we can look at the two profiles and we can look for indicators that tell us that is not human I give you a really specific example so there are very specific things in browsers in the signatures are browsers for example something called ActiveX control Well turns out only certain browsers have ActiveX control Internet Explorer is one of them chrome doesn't have ActiveX control and so if you see a browser that is a rendering itself as Chrome and it has ActiveX controls you know there's something off there's something that we would call in congruous and that would be an indicator that there's there's invalid traffic coming from that source and so you look at all of these different pieces of information you use machine learning and you have to be in a position where you you can devote I think a lot of time resources and effort to doing it and you can get to a pretty good place in terms of understanding what's real and what's not here's the hard part it's never going to be perfect in the reason is that people who actually
 great these body systems are doing it in many cases for fraudulent reasons for criminal reasons to try and it to literally take money that's why they call that fraud and so as a result they're attempting to purposely trick the system they're attempting to purposely find their way around and get their box to still run and so it's something that we have to be very focused on as an industry to try to stop there things like the trustworthy accountability group or tag which is an industry run group that great black list of IP addresses that that the companies that fish bait Institute and once IP address listed comes out from this centralized group than everybody ads that to their own internal list and it sure is that that traffic is not being counted as human so there's a lot of different levers that are being pulled to try to fight against non-human traffic is how we can even say with any degree of confidence what percentage of traffic is bought and what percentage of humor
 because Virginia power of fraudster yeah but I would do would be to put a keylogger on top of my computer log every keystroke and mouse movement and train a machine learning model to replicate human behavior based on my own behavior and then I would run this on my Mom's computer and my sisters computer and everybody I know is computer and I would average those different models together to create a bot that just replicated human browsing behavior and I would just change the destination address is 2 n o websites where I've got some you know survive set up some WordPress sites with beef recipes.com and I'm running my own display ads that I'm running display ads there that I'm getting from some exchange and you know I could deploy this to to a bunch of data centers and then go spoof the IP address is somehow an if I were to do that from the technology that
 I've seen it I don't know how that would be identifiable and so what that makes me wonder is how we can even be sure that the metrics that were gathering on like if we're staying okay X percent of traffic is bought X percentage human how can we say that with any reliability if we don't actually if we can't do it actually have the tools to disambiguate a bought from a human under the circumstances of a replay attack yeah I mean I guess what I would say is that first of all certainly it's a difficult area so I think you're right and and if somebody you know is is steadfast on committing a crime then they may be able to commit that crime and they may they may not get caught right away I think overtime though there's crumbs stairs there's things that happen and without going through all of the specific some of which would we I think better off not not share publicly because we are trying to detect these things and and stop
 this type of behavior where we can but there are things that you can look for there are signals that you can look for that indicate activity that doesn't look normal and so why you might think hey I'm just going to mimic normal activity and then replicate that usually there's something in that replication that's identifiable there's something in that automation that's identifiable we're human beings don't don't quite functioning exactly same way but it's not a perfect world in the sense that there is no way that you can say in all cases no matter what can every company in the space stop document traffic from from happening I do think though that we are making good progress and I do think that when we say something is not human we are really confident that that's the case and I think when you look at it at the numbers on your point could it be even higher than 4% it could be but we feel pretty good about about the numbers that we have them for her for whatever it's worth there's one at the only company in the space there's four
 different companies that offer these types of services and in from an order of magnitude perspective the numbers 10 to 10 to agree but yeah could there be somebody who came out with something that fraudulently and criminally figured out a way around one of these systems for a little while maybe but our view is that our technology is getting pretty good and we have a tremendous amount of people and investment going into trying to stop the Stop and we have a lot of data we know what real traffic looks like we know what real IP addresses look like much harder to be fake traffic at scale for a long time I think then then you might think

 whole fake news that the narrative that the fake news was a government conspiracy like a Russian government conspiracy I was like okay you know maybe that's possible like okay maybe it was a Russian government conspiracy to be that complicated somebody was putting up salacious news to draw traffic in to generate advertising Revenue it was kind of like mind-blowing at the time that you know if you follow Occam's razor like it's just somebody is doing it for the money it's not this vast Russian conspiracy but I don't know that do you have any thoughts on that like yeah so not know whether it's a Russian conspiracy and I have thoughts on what I do what I do have thoughts on is the fact that I think fake news is a real issue I think that there is and whether it's right for you know conspiracy purposes or just to make money okay
 but it is real issue there's there's what seems like what are pretending to be new stories that are being produced that are being put up on the website that are being put up on social media with intent to at the very least get people to believe something that is not true and maybe with an antenna that goes beyond that I guess from my perspective with my advertising industry lens on at the very least I'd like to not monetize that advice not have ads like to not have advertisers paying for the dissemination of fake news and so we joined in a partnership with a company called Story full and the City University of New York school of Journalism as well as a couple of other folks to create something we call open brand safety and the idea is to basically get a bunch of people together who in many cases are disinterested their parties akademiks universities folks that you know aren't buying or selling advertising that that should have don't care on either side of that but who do care about getting accurate information out there who do
 care about trying to create environments where our kids can consume news and not think that something crazy just happened it didn't actually happen and so I think what we hope will happen is we'll get to a a better place than where we're at today and I think that that the the power of valid information is critical the power of the internet is incredible we've all seen that we've all lived that that a story can come about everyone can suddenly believe that is the case and seemingly and turns out it might not be real and that's a real difference from what it was like 5 or 10 years ago or 15 years ago when we got all new I got our news in different in different ways than we can we do today and so I think those changes are are critical and I think we have to pay attention what I would tell you from the advertising perspective is advertising on the Internet by Google 90% of Google's revenue comes from digital advertising 95% something that order of magnitude of Facebook's Revenue comes from digital advertising so those two companies combined have
 market cap of something like one point 1 trillion dollars 1.1 trillion + so 90 to 95% of their business model that's funding a 1.1 trillion dollar ratio value is digital advertising and therefore in my belief digital advertising is funding the internet is funding the ability to find things fine people communicate message all that great things that that we love and so I think we have to be very thoughtful and focused and careful that we protect the great things about that we all love about the internet and it sure that we're not funding the things that that I think most of us would agree are not beneficiary to the societies all
 sync Google and Facebook's incentives are aligned with the companies who are running ads on their infrastructure I think it's complicated right these are really big companies first of all so I think one the predominance of their revenue is digital advertising so I think they're very much aligned in wanting to have a healthy internet wine to have a healthy should have marketing landscape where people are able to to communicate with each other including paid advertisers I happen to to believe that both companies do something that's pretty powerful for consumers have a hard time operating my day without interacting with both companies as a consumer and so I think that the value that they create from a chore perspective is virtually unmatched unlike anything that that certainly we've seen in in our lifetime I think and I think in terms of you know what is that what does that mean in terms of where they're going at I think it means
 certainly of all the revenues coming from advertising or a lot of it they're going to continue to ensure that advertising works but they're also incentivize to make sure that advertising works right there in San advised to make sure that it's a safe place that marketers can reach the the right people that marketers can can get the word out particularly because TV watching habits are changing particularly because the number one TV show every year gets fewer and fewer people that actually watch it simply just because we're going online and in some cases watching TV online but we're not watching traditional TV in the in the way that we once did and so as a result as a result of that changing landscape in the background I think they're strong and centers in place for marketers to figure out digital and they're strong incentives for a lot of the companies who are facilitating that transition to get it right so I think we're generally in pretty good alignment on that is there going to be hiccups along the way is there going to be challenges of course this is a big industry and some massive industry to change remember advertising is a 600 billion dollar into
 digital but total 600 billion dollars annually spend on Advertising which I believe fuels Commerce I think it fuels a lot of what we buy as people and so I think there is a huge importance that we should place on it and increasingly has become a digital I think these are issues that we have to work out so I'm happy as a as a consumer that companies are focused on trying to make advertising better the companies are focused on trying to create better user experiences that companies are focused on trying to make sure ads irrelevant and that we're actually showing people ads that actually turn into some sort of outcome that people end up taking an action as a result at Summit ocation that they like what they what they saw so I think all of those things are positive but it's a it's a work-in-progress none of this stuff is is easy and I think it's going to take us it's going to take us awhile to to continue to to iterate but it's something that I think is is critical to the future of the free and open internet which is I think Corte to at least what I
 she is that the future world that I want to live in the Google and Facebook ad units are tremendously Innovative and they are probably under rated for how Innovative they are and you know for all the complaints about Google and Facebook's duopoly I think there's plenty of room for Innovation on the front of other media companies other internet properties what do you think is going to change in future add units where they were talking about augmented reality add spaces or I don't know whatever other Buzz lingo you want to get into but I guess what are the what are the Innovations were going to see the next couple years I think advertising goes where people go and so where do I think people are are going when I did virtual reality for the first time I was blown away I was absolutely blown away when I did it right and have the right headset on and did the right experience I felt like I was there I literally felt like I was I had
 transported somewhere else and so I think things like virtual reality things like augmented reality obviously there's been a lot of activity in the home around voice with Alexa and Google home and other products I think that we are going to see the landscape of what is of what is digital of what is the internet why didn't significantly we've talked about it for a long time but I think we're getting to a place where everything is is going to be digitally enabled at some level and a many kisses simply in the background and so something is happening without us having to the store couldn't go go online or get a device or take some take some hard action and so as consumers change the way that they behave The Leverage augmented reality or leverage virtual reality in a new way ultimately I think advertising well will flow to those environment because marketers want to tell stories where where people are and so when I think about the Innovation I don't think it's just going to be on format I think that advertising is going to change pretty
 definitely both in format and how it presents itself and how we judge success and how we pay for it how it turns act on it and there's a lot of things that are going to change but what will be the truth I think I'm the other side of this whole transition will still be that a marketer is going to want to story-tell in order to reach a consumer and they're going to want that consumer off Emily to take some action even if it's you know talking the device and telling the device to buy their product it's still going to be about communicating a message in order to get somebody to take an action and so the mechanisms will certainly change and I think that's part of the excitement and part of the fun of this space but I think in the end of the day the core sort of thesis of what advertising is is going to continue the other thing I would say I'm a big fan of Warren Buffett I was obviously very famous investor not the most famous investor and buff it talks about this connection that consumers have with brants it's a trust he says and intangible thing he says when you say the word Coca-Cola everybody has their mom
 something specific that mean something to them about Coca-Cola whatever whatever it is and he says it's really hard for brand to build that kind of awareness for brand new build that kind of instant intangible connection that they have with consumers and buff it talks about what protects companies from competition ultimately is what he calls their moat which was actually the reason we need the company mode and he says he wants to invest in companies that have these big wide moat sore in my words is really strong brands that is really strong intangible connections with with their consumers so then it's awfully hard to compete with them and so I feel pretty hopeful and optimistic about the future about innovation in advertising about getting through some of the issues with ADD prod Insite design his in the end of the day I do think that we like to buy things we like two to make things and I think that we're going to continue on for for the foreseeable future pretty strong
 yourself that I've looked at a lot of these different kind of companies that are somewhat in Motes Payson from just talking to people and looking at the different offering stressing like mode has the most are you talking about a brand motasim to have the strongest brand among these different types of services and yeah I mean I'm optimistic to like I am I I like to scrutinize the traffic stop and I find it really interesting and I find it a difficult experiment to observe like how much human traffic there is how much bought traffic there is but I'm pretty optimistic like whatever you know whatever verifiable human characteristics we can transpose the internet today we're going to have a lot more in the future when we get to retina scanning and whatever else other human verification anyway John has been great talking to you of Washtenaw detox online so it was a great treat to have a chance to interview you thank you so much Jeff thank you for taking the time and I think straight when listening in okay

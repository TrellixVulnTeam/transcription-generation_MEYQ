Transcription: online advertising is heavily affected by a set of delusions and fraudulent practices that few people in the ad tech industry have an interest in stopping or disclosing this is the Curious perverse nature of the world of online media some of the online advertising that we see does fulfill its job on the rare occasion when an ad successfully conveys a meaningful message from a marketer to a consumer but there are reasons to be extremely skeptical of the way that online advertising Works in this episode and several more to come software engineering daily will be diving it deep into the ad Tech business to understand the bot fraud and the mass psychosis that bolsters artec media Giants

 Bob Hoffman is the author of the ad contrarian a long-running Blog about advertising welcome to software engineering daily how are you this is the first of a series of shows that I'm publishing about the online advertising industry and start with you because you are not an engineer I am the farthest thing from an engineer you know the later shows the later shows are going to focus on ADD Tack and add fraud and there's more technical topics but I feel like you can introduce the listeners to some of the things that are at the top of the advertising funnel that lead to the sorts of Fraud and misbehavior further down the stack so with that in mind let's just start with like the simple relationship of a marketer trying to sell products to the consumers that are being messaged so as we have moved to digital advertise
 what has changed about the relationship of a marketer to that consumer that the marketers targeting
 it has become much more of a one-to-one direct response cell most advertising well I should say must have been a lot of advertising in the traditional advertising world was what we called brand or product advertising and and then there was some of it that was direct response advertising and they come from two different genealogies so there's the there's the Madison Avenue style of advertising which we were used to before the web which was TV and radio and outdoor and it was about building Brands and it was about promoting products and then we also had what we used to call junk mail which was direct response advertising and 800 numbers and the objective of direct response advertising is to get people
 now the objective of the other genealogy the man Madison Avenue style of advertising what's to build Brands and since the since we have online advertising has become ascendant I would have happened is that online advertising which we thought or many of us in the advertising World thought would be like traditional advertising in that it would be effective brand building advertising has really turned out to be mostly from the other genealogy the the direct response kind of junk mail advertising the advantage of that direct response advertising is that the the response is something that is a little more measurable than the idea of blasting out or sitting up YouTube putting up a billboard that is for Tide detergent
 and just kind of putting your finger in the wind and hoping you can get a sense for how much that billboard is helping your brand while so but the problem is as we move online this creates a perverse incentives for for companies to fudge the numbers because you have you got these data-driven marketers that are addicted to seeing a number connected to how their advertising campaign is is functioning on the internet and that number can be Juiced it can be messed with show what are some of those numbers that were talking about here and how what are the ways in which that relationship between the marketer and the consumer has been made a little dysfunctional by this data-driven numerical analytics industry that has come up around that
 genealogical like you said the direct response genealogy well it's more than slightly a problem if it's a big problem First Market is have gotten addicted to the idea of instant gratification so they see a number immediately and that's what they love and the problem is that the numbers are tremendously unreliable because of many things including at fraud but the other problem is that that's not really how ever tizing works I advertising is like exercise right and if if I go out and I run 10 miles all of a sudden today I'm not going to I'm not going to feel better or feel healthier tomorrow matter fact I'm going to probably throw up and feel terrible but if I do it everyday for a year a year from now I'm going to feel a lot
 better and be a lot healthier that's that's how Exercise Works and that's how it and that's how brand advertising works when you advertise today you're not suddenly going to be successful tomorrow you're going to you're going to have to do it for a while and a year from now your brand is probably going to be healthier and in better shape and more popular and more successful than it is today but the problem is marketers are getting used to the idea of instant gratification and short-term ISM and that's and that's one of the big problems that online advertising is creating
 now there's also the idea that there are certain brands that are they don't really have competitors in the marketplace and so I'm pretty sure what your perspective is on on that because it take a brand like Tesla there's they don't do much brand advertising as I know as far as I know you've talked about the same thing with apple which I found very interesting about how Apple doesn't do I'm sorry they don't do online they don't do the online trackable advertising as much as they do they do more the pervasive brand advertising you see apple on Billboard you see apple on commercials you don't see apple advertising that is like click driven and data-driven as much and it's retarded exact okay so what why is Apple doing at why do you use apple is that example because is it because Apple doesn't have any substitutes and it's more of like they just won
 pervasive what it like why why doesn't Apple do the data driven type of advertising and why are they more motivated to do to do Billboards and stuff like that because Apple Smart Apple is the most successful company in the world and they know what they're doing and they are not I mean Apple doesn't have a Twitter feed her Facebook page State they do what has built their brand very very successfully and it's not that they don't have competitors they have tremendous competitors but they are very smart and they know what they're doing and it's remarkable that here is the number one technology company in the world and they do almost no online digital advertising their there they're below the line stuff we go below the line stuff like documents and and and web pages
 they do a great job of that on mine there online stuff is brilliant but it's not their advertising their advertising is television and it's outdoor and it's print and they do it very well and they're very successful at it and it what's remarkable to me is that the rest of the marketing industry hasn't learned from Apple about how to be successful with advertising so now I think the the overarching message that I get from what I've heard you talk about what I've I listen to your podcast the ad contrarian podcast I have read your blog and my impression from reading what you said in from looking at the advertising industry is that show this newer generation of advertisers that wants a data-driven approach to marketing they want to know how many ads lead to conversions they want to know how many ads lead to an actual purchase of a
 t-shirt they're not necessarily wrong and they're not necessarily incapable of tracking the purchase of a t-shirt from the click of an ad and on the other all the other hand the brand advertisers of the past who would in the past might have wanted to just plaster the internet with a bunch of ads for Tide detergent put their finger in the wind and hope that it's affecting their sales in on a macro level that may not be as traceable those people are not necessarily wrong to to want to do that kind of brand advertising on the internet even though that type of brand advertising may have decreased over time and gone towards for the trackable neither of the sides are are wrong but the issues that you talked about as I understand are the fact that the marketplace exploits the the behaviors of both of those types of marketers in the in the brand advertising land the the marketplace xploitz those brand advertisers
 by placing those brand ads in places where nobody is ever going to see the ad the only person that's going to see it is a bot and end the the sleazy part of the industry can get away with that because these brand advertisers can't really measure it even in the best case scenario and then on the other side of things the people who are who are driven by trackable advertising those people are exploited by very sophisticated botnets that are doing things like getting all the way to the end of the shopping cart you know they're putting the t-shirt in there shopping cart and then they're just dropping off from there and then these these these data driven marketers are like all look how good are campaign when you we had all this you know all the shopping carts with t-shirts in them but you know they could drop off so is that accurate do you get the sense that both of these types of ever has just been completely exploded yeah they're not being you know completely exploded there are some people who are using at
 successfully end of using online advertising successfully but most but most advertisers are not most advertisers don't know what they're buying they don't know who they're buying it from they don't know what they're getting they don't know how much they're paying but they're doing it because everyone else is doing it and and and as you say the the in the analysis they're getting is not reliable it's often fraudulent but they keep doing it and they're there so much uncertainty about what you're getting when when you're buying online advertising that it's remarkable that it keeps growing at the rate that keeps growing now do you have does anybody have a good picture of how pervasive these
 botnets are know what we know is if you want to make a lot of money fast get into the edge fraud business according to you let Packard add fraud has both the highest payout and the lowest risk of any type of online criminal activity billions of dollars are being stole of being stolen from advertises every year and almost no one is ever prosecuted in fact it's not even clear that all kinds of online at fraud or illegal Nobody Knows the size and scope of of advertising for people think they know but they don't all estimates of the size of at Florida based on highly conjectural assumptions
 they range from the airport they range from 2% to 90% which is another way of saying we don't know we don't have the slightest idea so many things and I know you get really irked by the way that the end of your sponsor this I get erect too it's it is I think it's really just frustrating and disgusting and it don't want one thing that's frustrating you talk to people in the industry in your like okay so there's tons of fraud in the industry is this fraud getting priced into the cost of online advertising. Yeah of course and you're like okay so how does it get priced in if the market is not smart enough to even to even describe what percentage of the advertising on the Internet is being served Bots how is that getting priced it like this is it like an inefficient Mark even if you're efficient market hypothesis dog
 dogmatist you have to admit that if the market has a information asymmetry they can't know if the cost is being baked in of course if you don't know the extent of the problem how can you possibly take the costume when the estimates go from 2% to 90% how can I how can it be baked into the cost that it's baloney and a you know the one of the problems is that one of the great beneficiaries of add fraud inadvertently is the marketing industry because the ad fraud comes into the into the process after the advertising industry has taken its cut
 after the agency has been paid after the DSP gets his cut after the after the tech of the ad tech companies get their cut then the asteroid comes in and and but meanwhile but the marketing and illegitimate marketing industry inadvertently has already made its money so so there isn't probably as much incentives for the legitimate add industry to do what it should be doing to get rid of bad front
 okay so explain that more days so so are you saying that like chill like let's say it let's let's let's take this like from from the market or to the to the down to the marketplace for if your Procter & Gamble and you're putting his bunch of advertising for tide in Tide detergent into the marketplace what are you saying about how the marketing industry actually so it always the relationship that that that that Procter & Gamble goes to a third party marketing agency in hit says hey can you play some ads for us or are you just driving there according to the World Federation of advertising okay so you the client investment is a hundred percent you're spending let's say a million dollars for online advertising so the agency of record will take I'm giving you average figures okay will take 5% and then the trading desk will take 15% and then the demand
 side platform will take 10% and then add Tech Middle Men doing data and targeting and verification will take 25% and then there's an ad exchange that will take 5% so now you've already spent what 2030 6570 percent of your dollars before it gets to the publisher so there's 40% left and the the the assuming a 10% fraud the the publisher will get 36% and the fraudster will get 4% and assuming a 30% fraud the publisher will get the 28% and the the fraudster will get 12% but in the meantime 60% of the money only 40% gets
 ever gets to the publisher where the fraud occurs 60% has already been taken by the legitimate marketing industry by the agency of record by the trading desk by the DSP by the by the ad tech people and by the exchange so am I make myself clear is this to make sense so I can show talking to other parties that that benefit from a social one thing that I did it creeps me out about this is that the the most ambitious estimation of how much farther is are typically like 7.5 billion dollars are in a 7.5 billion dollars is being taken out of the advertising industry for fraud but then I look at like the biggest what are the biggest add two countries biggest tech companies are Facebook and Google and would I don't know how much like how can we say that
 only 7.5 billion is being taken out of the industry due to fraud when Facebook and Google are worth a lot more than 7.5 billion dollars a piece like out how much you know how much are they how much do Facebook in Google make from this right because it seems like they are somewhat incentivized to not totally police the fraud like they're there to a certain extent but not entirely but but let me answer that two ways first Facebook and Google are essentially the online expertise against I'm in between the two of them there's probably I'm guessing 65 to 70% of online display advertising doll online advertising dollars are going to Facebook and Google the rest are rats and mice
 so so in a sense they are they they are profiting from marketers to scism about fraud every place else and they assume that because Google and Facebook are so large that there's probably not as much fraud there and therefore it's a safe place to go with their online advertising. Whether that's true or not I have no way of knowing that I think that's the psychology of a lot of advertisers but getting back to your knee or seven and a half billion for a minute that equates to about 5% of the global online advertising spent but most estimates play sad fraud much higher than 5% in fact the world advertising Federation estimates that add fraud is probably near 30% which would take that 7
 .5 number up by 6 times and believe it or not if add fraud is 10% if that is 10% of online advertising by 2025 in just what six and a half years eight and a half years
 a tad fraud is going to be the second largest criminal activity in the world second only to drug trafficking it's astounding how large is this what kind of position is Facebook in Google in here I mean can they can they do anything about add fraud or or should they do anything I'm really not this is a very technical question which I am not in a position to answer I don't know how to fight at front I just know that it's huge and and up the problem with ADD fraud is that the one of the big problems is that organized crime has not yet gotten into it in a big way but organized crime is going to get into it in a big way because there's way too
 much money there for them to for them to bypass I am and a right now most of add fraud is being done by black hat marketers that you know people who used to be webmasters or have CEO SEO backgrounds and they're highly skilled marketing technologists and they're doing a lot of the fraud and then their illegitimate ad networks and then they are a common cybercriminals but organized crime is not into it yet in a big way as far as we know but they're going to be into it because there is so much money in it what about me let's talk about the legitimacy again Force per second to to play The Devil's Advocate or however you are
 rephrase it so I mean
 when is advertising effective in who was it effective for like what does it take to just take like a a CMO who is really dedicated to doing it right in and then it's going to be an effective strategy like when when is advertising actually effective we talking about online advertising I think online advertising is effective when it is aimed at direct response I think that's the that that's where it can be effective the problem is that the click rates are so low the the average click rates for for online advertising are 7 Clicks in 10,000 odds you have to run 10,000 online display ads to get seven people to click that I mean that's remarkably low but still I I think there are people who know how to do it right and they are at and they
 are the the the they are benefiting from from online advertising most marketers don't know how to do it right in there just throwing money at it and if your CMO you have to put your yourself in the place of the CMO the life expectancy of a CMO is that when sane Lilo you know if you last 18 months are two years at your job you're probably about average and answer your first priority as a CMO is to stay employed right and and if you invest money in online display advertising you may be one hundred percent wrong but you're wrong within the normal range you're wrong in the same way that everyone else is wrong and you probably won't be fired for it but if you're not doing display advertising on your boss the CEO ask you why now
 you may be a hundred percent right but you're not in the normal range anymore and you can get fired for that so what do you want to do is you want to stay in the normal range of your CMO and do what everyone's doing and the same is true for that agencies it's very hard to explain to your client why you're not doing display advertising or social media or content marketing even though it may be completely ineffective because you're outside the normal range and it and it's very hard to be outside the normal range these days in the marketing world and survive
 Apache Kafka is a modern message broker and it provides the messaging backbone for building a new generation of distribute applications you can listen to a podcast I did with her roku's engineering team about Kafka and how the team at Heroku built and is using Apache Kafka as a service using Kafka on Heroku can save your team hours of tuning and configuration and maintenance work provisioning and operating apache-kafka is often a challenge so check out Apache Kafka on Heroku you can get a great introduction to that product by listening to the episode I did with Tom crayford of Heroku Kafka I did it on October 25th 2016 so you should check it out thanks to Heroku for being a sponsor software engineering daily I don't do episodes for every sponsor I am very particular about the shows that I do and Heroku
 is a service that I've used many times in the past so I am happy to do a show about the architecture of a key building block of a service that I use on a regular basis thanks again to your Roku for being a sponsor software Gene Kelly
 you were in charge of at least one Ad Agency show of of to add agencies but the most recent slate only one yes right so when you were in charge of those did you did you try to have these conversations with raspberry like you know I don't think you should do this and they're like but that's not normal I tried unsuccessfully yeah I was you know you can't stay in that mean one of the reasons I retired from the agency business not the only reason but one of the ones is that I couldn't I couldn't tell the truth anymore and it became a very uncomfortable for me I couldn't say what was really on my mind because my clients wanted to hear something else that you know it's very hard to to convince someone of something that they don't want to believe and and I was always fighting livid my class
 I want to put more money into online advertising and and I I felt the advertising was ineffective I felt that the day that we were getting was not reliable but they wanted to believe it was very hard for me to just say what was really on my mind so this is what is so weird to me about Center Street cuz this stuff seems like it is at this point you could considering how much of our hold digital economy has developed as a result of online advertising this to me seems like a Michael Lewis scale Financial I don't even know if you want to call it a financial Scandal because he even the people that are at the losing end of it are kind of complicit I mean you do it it's not as much like the mortgage crisis where it's like you know you have people who are at the
 end of the socioeconomic Spectrum taking out mortgages that they really can't or shouldn't take out you have Reno Frito-Lay getting bilked out of a bunch of money but it is the remarkable thing is that
 online advertising seems to be serving no one's purpose I'm good that the three largest stakeholders in online advertising are very unhappy with the state of it first or the consumer's right consumers are very unhappy with online advertising the the user experience is abominable we have 400 million people who are using ad blockers Ducks Earl says this is the largest boycott of anything in the history of humanity write a recent study reported that two out of three Millennials in the US which is the group that every Market or seems to be obsessed with use at least one ad blocker ad blocking is growing every year by double digits and the only thing that's
 venting the universal use of ad blockers is ignorance according to one study 80% of the people who know about the existence of Ed blockers use them so that's the first state that the consumers are the first state girl holders who are unhappy second other publishers
 40 to 70% off store or some of their blog or use site right and write 40 to 70% of AD Revenue that should be going to those Publishers is being siphoned off by middleman buy at Tech Middle meant leaving very little money for the people who are actually producing and Publishing the content the guardian the the the the the newspaper in the UK did a study a few weeks ago and went in and they did a very smart think they bought online ad space on their own website okay to see what happened to the money and they found that as much as 70% of the money was going to middleman and they were only getting 30% of the money for Fourth of the of the advertising money that the
 the advertisers thought they were spending on advertising space so the Publishers are unhappy and third the advertisers are unhappy over 70% of marketing executive say that they are unhappy with the current state of online advertising so who was it serving if the consumers are and happy if the Publishers are in happy if the advertisers are not aren't happy happy face them is the system is still good and they're doing a baby I mean they are doing such a great job. I mean it's hurting everyone else but but they are remarkable and pay there in a story of course you don't want this think about it
 Facebook started
 if your Facebook started as a social medium right you were going to put a page up on Facebook and it was to be free and people were going to post about a brand on Facebook and that was going to be shared with their friends and their friends were going to share it with everyone else and it was going to end paid advertising because of the social sharing of brand exuberance and it all turned out to be complete bullshit bullshit they say that a soda little bit I'll make that money from Social them do anything they are traditional Advertiser you go you put traditional paid advertising a big fat at right in the middle of people's Facebook feeds right it is the idea that it was going to be social sharing and people going to share their enthusiasm for rent it was a fantasy
 it was a complete fantasy study by the guardian and I looked at that and just so listeners understand so the guardian which is a new online newspaper makes 20 from ad Revenue basically said okay we've been giving our we've been we've been basically publishing stuff and letting somebody else handle the advertising stuff we basically have this ad space we let some other companies or middle men take care of when ads get posted we've been getting revenue from this and they say hey you know what let's see what happens when we take control of this and we allocate like we figure out this disbanded a little more granular level and even when they did that there was still a large percentage of their under no I'm sorry they bought ads right where would I go
 Fresno the guardian is Big newspaper in in the UK they have an online version of course and they wanted to see how much of the advertising money that that that they're advertising clients are spending actually gets to them and how much is siphoned off by other people and they found that you know if I am Bob Hoffman's whatever I make what's a I make automobile waffles Baba Frozen on the Guardians website and I spend $100 the guardian whines up with $30 and all the attic middlemen and everyone else binds up with $70 and I think I'm buying $100 worth of advertising space on on the guardian and I'm only buying I'm spending $100 but I'm only getting $30 worth of advertising
 but let's talk about that what is going on there so you have these middlemen image of so you would dance like I'm Bob's frozen waffles I want to buy $100 of every has new the guardian go to the guardian and say hey give me $100 worth of ads on your site but in actuality there are these layers between the advertiser and the publisher like right open Tasker app Nexus or all kinds of other stuff explain what is going on what are these layers of exchanges and stuff in between the publisher and the brand wants to advertise on that publisher there was a black box of adtech that I don't understand and I don't think anyone understands that is in between the advertiser and the publisher so for example if I want to buy the
 a page in the New York Times newspaper I go to the New York Times and I say I want to buy a page of advertising and I give them you know $10,000 for page of advertising and I see my ad on Page in the New York Times for some reason which you technology guys understand and I don't that kind of Simplicity has been squeezed out of the online advertising industry and there's all kinds of layers of stuff that get between me the advertiser and you the publisher for I'm not sure what reason I don't understand why the online advertising ecosystem is built this way and I don't know who it serves other than
 the the middle meant I I don't think it serves the advertiser I don't think it serves the publisher and it certainly doesn't serve the consumer who's annoyed with with the ad Tech stuff that's getting in the way of what they want to do if if advertisers could just buy
 a page from a publisher if I wanted to go to the guardian online right and just buy an ad on their on their website I don't see why I can't just do that directly with them where I need to go through all these middle men who are sucking up so much of the money now theoretically the reason for all these men middleman is that they optimize the buy it makes the buy more efficient the fact is that it's hard to believe they make the buys more efficient when there's only 7 clicks for every 10,000 dad's how much less efficient can you be I mean I don't understand how people believe that this is creating more fishing stuff will one way it does that I can see it creating more efficiency and I can understand how the started to develop is if you know if your the guardian
 you want to think about the stories that you're writing you don't want to think about the about selling as you don't want to think about that back office stuff so you can say hey exchange can you just find me so mad that will run on my on my page and we'll make sense for my viewers for my readers to see and on the other on the other hand you can you know that the advertiser doesn't want to think okay I need to Target middle-aged males who are single and don't have a lot of time so they want to make frozen waffles for breakfast you you just want to say that that's what you wanted that's what you want to be able to say to the distribution network of your advertising you want to be able to go and say I want to start at these demographics I don't want to need to go to the guardian and ask them hey do you dear readers like frozen waffles and so the there it makes sense to have this distribution platform
 as a middleman theoretically theoretically theoretically theoretically it does the problem is it hasn't worked for example Procter & Gamble is the world's largest Advertiser okay and they have been using Facebook for what it's called Precision targeting and instead of targeting demographic groups as light as advertised as would normally do Facebook promises them all this data that will get them directly to people who want exactly that product with Precision targeting so Procter & Gamble has been doing that on Facebook and they have found that it is working less effectively then demographic targeting which is how they traditionally do advertising and in fact they have cancelled their
 their Precision targeted Facebook advertising and gone to demographically targeted advertising as they used to in fact last year their sales dropped 8% which is it in in in the case of of Procter & Gamble is over six billion dollars in sales drop and a significant part of that has been attributed they have attributed it to being too precise in there targeting in fact if you're a mass marketer and you want to grow your brand you have to do Mass advertising all this Precision targeting stuff that the online advertising world has promised us has turned out to be as far as I'm concerned so far mainly below
 and if you want to prove that to yourself the thing to do is to walk through your local supermarket and try to find a brand of anything that has been built with online advertising what you're going to find a branch that have been built by television and radio and outdoor French and there's almost nothing in the supermarket that you can find that it's been built by online advertising then go to Walmart and do the same thing then go to Target and do the same thing in fact it is my belief that if you want to do successful mass-market brand advertising and build your brand the way to do it is not through the Precision the quote Precision targeting of online advertising
 are you sure that's not because we are just now figuring out how to do that cuz you look at Dollar Shave Club and Casper mattress and these highly vertical lized brand does seem to be like a new form of advertising where they they have a blended strategy of brand advertising and direct response that actually seems quite effective yes there are a few brands that have been built that way but for the most part they have not been built that way you can name a few brand chicken name a handful of brands that have been built that way through either social media or through online advertising but they are very few and far between now the brands that you do see at a supermarket when you're walking through Tide detergent Bops frozen waffles
 Etc
 did did these things did the black Tide detergent to Tide detergent manage to cross the chasm into the digital age because they maintain their foothold through online advertising or was it just did they already had their foothold in being and having a presence in the supermarket or television commercials like that's all that matters or well you have to understand that advertising is only a small part it it it's not the only part of brand development and when your Tide detergent and you've been selling detergent for generations to families and when you have shelf space in supermarkets that helps you a lot and distribution is a very very important part of of marketing success
 but the the whether or not breaking into the online advertising world has helped them maintain their status or not I can't answer that I it it it that seems to me to be a proposition that would be a difficult to prove and based on Proctor and Gamble's experience where they at where they took in in 2013 or 2014 they took one third of their advertising dollars and put them online and have experienced horrible sales losses I think would be very difficult to make that case if you're an Advertiser what should you be doing today with digital advertising hot can't do you at can you actually use digital advertising to your advantage
 I think search is effective search advertising search advertising is effective I think email advertising to some degree is effective I think social media is a good way to keep in touch with your best customers but it's not going to build your brand I think content marketing is only effective for very popular brands that nobody is interested in content about pencils and mayonnaise and frozen waffles if your Nike if your
 you know if your Apple Shore content marketing will be effective cuz people you're very popular brand people are interested in social media is mainly you know if you're a rockstar if you are this year of actor if you're a famous athlete social media is great if you're making once again if you're making pencils and mayonnaise nobody gives a shit about your tweets and your Instagrams display advertising is highly suspect I don't trust any of the numbers I think that the amount you know the problems with viewability that almost 50% of all display as that you paid pay for don't even appear on a page where anyone can see it then you had the problems of Fraud and you had the problems of banner blindness it's a very
 risky proposition is for I'm not a very good investment as far as I'm concerned unless you're a direct response marketing her and you can measure and and your measurements are reliable that you're getting a reasonable Roi from your display at Investments what if I left that what other kinds of online I must have some stuff you know you know the what is the one thing maybe is like what I would has been really effective for me and I consider myself a user with a lot of scrutiny I'm sure most used. Probably consider themselves at though we're really works for getting me is like these Brands were they make like a really compelling YouTube video or Facebook video and then they like attach these track of ways of tracking me through the internet and then I'll like I'm on Facebook and I or I'm on YouTube and I see you some viral video
 attached to a brad like Old Spice Old Spice does really well with it the shower guy that and and and then like you know after I've watched that video or then I'll start to see other little like callbacks to that video or that experience that are like prodding me throughout my navigation through Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and stuff and that stuff it has been I feel pretty effective at least in getting me to associate a brand with like a sense of humor or a certain lifestyle or something and I'm sure that gets me at some basil level absolutely and that is the value of great creativity because when you do great creative work it doesn't matter what Medium you're in a good spot is a good spot on any screen and a bad spot is a bad spot on every screen and a few day of the
 as matter fact the Old Spice guy that you're talking about starters a TV commercial and then they then they went online with it and they use it very effectively and yeah I find in you know it's not to say that online advertising can't be great it can be it's a question of doing great creative work and getting it in front of people and if you do that it's going to be effective but sadly most of the online advertising is horrible most of it is it it it it's from that direct response School of advertising which nobody likes which is annoying and and and consequently is ineffective on search advertising search advertising seems good because you're already in the market for something right you don't go to Google unless you're looking to buy some
 Emmet search marketing is effective because
 it it's not about creating demand it's about fulfilling Demand right I go to Google when I've already decided that I'm going to Hawaii when I made a buying decision then I go to Google to find the best price and what hotels to stay at in all that kind of stuff right that's what search is great at its great at fulfilling the med but it's not great at creating demand as matter fact it doesn't create usually it doesn't usually Kratom and it's where people go once they have decided on that they're going to buy something or do something it does also strike me is more resilient to fraud I'm not because I'm not 2% sure about that but I'm not sure I really don't know the technology of a fraud as it relates to go out of Technology of anything as fraud relates to Google I don't say I am with you I guess
 that it's probably not as Laden with fraud as the display advertising industry is yeah and that's that's the The Beacon of Hope I have for Facebook and Google also in just also the fact that they are these identity platforms we have an identity of a very reliable identity that can be formed by a specific person that can can verify if that person's Behavior interactions brand is legitimate or not but I'm sorry I wish I could get somebody from Facebook or Google to talk to me about this stuff but they are extremely tight-lipped about in fact that is the other than that I know that's the other thing that works you about this is the closed lips of the ad industry and just how they will not talk about fraud and detail
 well it's not just the clothes lips it's the fact that they will not allow themselves to be measured by the same third right measurements that all the other advertising forms used now if you are not hiding anything why would you do that why would you not allow third-party impartial measurement of your status of your numbers but there's only one reason that I can think of to not allow that and that is you're hiding something and I can't prove it but I have a strong feeling about you so if you are at Facebook or Google and you're an engineer you should be asking questions you should go to the ad Department and ask question you're a liar I honestly I think this is like a moral imperative I mean look look look at what happened with Facebook just a few weeks ago it was determined that like what 80% of the
 of the of the video viewing that they claimed turned out to be wrong turned out to be fraudulent and how can it how can it be that for 2 years they were claiming 80% more video viewing than they were getting and none of these Geniuses who were supposed to be digital experts realized it right all these media buyers and and the digital experts in the people who are who are
 about the information in the end phrase for this stuff for 2 years they were over estimating by 80% and not one of these people caught it how could that be it's because nobody knows what the hell's going on yeah that's the problem yeah nobody really knows everyone thinks they know but nobody really knows yeah well that's a great note to end on Bob I want to thank you for coming to show everybody should check out the ad contrarian blog and podcast and you got some great Talks on YouTube as well so don't forget my book marketers Are from Mars consumers are from New Jersey it's available at Amazon thank you you can find in the freezer aisle of your local supermarket

Transcription: Edwin chin is a data scientist and blogger he previously LED data science at Dropbox and Google Edwin welcome to software engineering daily
 but you could be here we've done a few shows giving an overview of what data science is for this episode I'd like to focus on what a data scientist does you were the head of core data science at Google what were your responsibilities there
 show me a couple
 so when large chunk of it would be on my own work and so by elaborate a little bit more by coredata science I Google I focused on Star Trek Discovery at YouTube the effect of things like crowdsourcing and musical station that will be my old work so I might be riding in that produced job to pull data for presenting this analysis to a bunch of different teams that might find it useful or I might just be running some different machine learning algorithms to say improve YouTube recommendations or to improve CTR on the Google Play store management role or was it more of a actual heads down analytics roll
 focus more on which a lot of other people do you have for me personally it was a mixture of both focus on my own like individual contributions and Google data science track is quantitative analyst II and you've written about this a bit what type of work is this level of engineer doing really depends on the team that European so Google has a couple different quantitative analyst / data science games for second two different teams has its own team and they're all kind of different kinds of work depending on what
 so the people in Google ads trying to predict CTR or functions to advertisers and yes I like very very good decisions Mystics and more on things like a user analysis and business intelligence and so the people who worked on the swapper statistically or they might come from
 oh my God user analysis are working on products or entry level data scientists at Google have to know Technologies Beyond sequel that they have to know how to run mapreduce jobs
 definitely a lot of people like most people actually who come into Google didn't ever written an offer to stop before so I wear as you might be like I asked if you know what the concept of mapreduce is an interview and you might kind of expected to know how it works is the interview process for the data science type rolls the same as it is for software Engineers I know there are two different ladders so when is a software engineering ladder and so you'll be tested on typical software engineering things like like a gorilla memes or distributed systems quantitative analysis letter and they are totally different question so these will be things like stats questions already asked me to
 are both of those types of energy tracks whiteboarding with the high-pressure whiteboarding situations
 it really depends on your interviewer so most interview or would you prefer a whiteboard in but there are actually some in a few minutes. Who all I gave you a laptop and a security code on what are your thoughts on those the types of high pressure whiteboarding jobs or or just like you know even even on the on the laptop you know your Broad and you got the 45 minute session with the interviewer to do the interview Under Pressure do you think that makes sense for interviews
 so I meant I never asked any whiteboarding questions myself or I never ask a question denim Alston unlike some extra math or just write something down but whenever I ask any questions I'll just give him a laptop and ask them to court up that laptop when possible today you know you can actually write something and see if it runs and I do like a lot of companies nowadays they are doing something we're pretty designs candidate still give them an actual date 45-minute interview a couple hours to go through the data set and like yeah
 Don the other end of the ladder from the introductory data scientist or quantitative analyst there's the principal quantitative analyst and a quote in one of your post where you said there were a few principal quantitative Analyst at Google who couldn't tell you what Bayes theorem was or even with a CSV file or mapreduce was does it say anything about like our preconceived notions of data scientists or like what the benchmarks for a data scientist should or shouldn't be
 yes I think what this says is more about the so I definitely think that any should know what is a should know basic statistics
 like it's like you know whenever you're doing any kind of work you're obviously going to be manipulated at the house and see if I was and if you don't know what he thinks it's hard to know whether your weather in ounces are cracking her dress and so I think that like Google and that there are just so many pauses going on and especially with the hot wire is Google made it to the bar for a lot of people with higher interesting so I can a choir would happen and somebody who's getting fired like that you don't don't have a good roll for him so you stick them in the principal quantitative analyst role in it and then it dilutes the quality of principal quantitative analyst correct correct
 you're not always charge that the like you don't have to say it past it the past the saying like a rigorous interview process that other people do and so a lot of times you just kind of scared to slip through with your party
 dissect a difficult data science problem that you encountered while you were Google Google what was the question of how do you get people to increase steroids increase their YouTube usage on so maybe someone like watches you to one or two times a week or maybe the only watch you to whenever someone send them an email containing like a cat video and so how'd how do you like turn them into someone who starts watching YouTube Everyday this is a hard problem because it's I'm getting at the notion of causality and interventions like we want to do something that causes you to it to return more war as all the all the data that we have in the long as it's just really correlational so we know how people who will come to YouTube Every Day different kind of watch a lot more music videos they tend to watch a lot of gaming videos
 where is someone who only will come see you tomorrow night 2 times a month my only watching like funny cat videos of funny dog videos correlational it would be like if we send emails to people who only watch cat videos telling them that they should watch like Starcraft or League of Legends or just random gaming videos like that's not very difficult question because it started between cause and correlation like even though everybody says it's statement that doesn't like body help you forgot what does need to causation interesting text you think people have about correlation vs causation over and over again on that people will Coral
 an old findings and try to use them as a something bad I member when someone else on a different email YouTube to work on wise if we look at people who watch YouTube Everyday they tend to watch like 10 channels or a more diverse channels and people who only comes YouTube twice a week and it doesn't really
 like it it's kind of obvious enough and like
 obviously not a close doesn't really help you at all as as a reason for sending sending people more and more emails introducing them to you like new artist in you YouTube creators that I've never heard of before and at the end she said yeah but yeah we know that correlation is not causation just ended up resenting does NOS anyway and using it as a reason to basically do whatever they wanted
 so I think it would just know that is love people will say that grow in correlation is not causation kind of just that the wrong way Commons right before you worked on ads quality at Twitter what is ADD quality and how do you strive to pursue it so every quality refers to the question of how do you mask users with high-quality relevant ads so just would be things like the machine Learning Systems to predict the assistance to run advertising auctions to figure out which ads are they winning
 how big of a problem are Bots
 Autobots were they shoot problem when I was at Twitter but it was still big enough and big enough in the future that there was a there was a team dedicated specifically it is the is the battle with advertising Bots similar to the classic war of attrition between like email spammers and Gmail anti-spam filters
 yeah I would imagine so I actually had not work I did not work on the advertising bought for myself that's what I said don't know much about it but I think so I could sleep on the phone with his dad and as is that you're just have bought two are randomly clicking on ads on the ads on your competitors in order to like I got done to you have to pay up for these empty eye clinics that don't actually generate any value for them and like I said okay well as far as things you actually did work on what are some engineering tactics that you use to ensure add quality some tactics are on data science so we had a lot of machine Learning Systems sell or machine learning systems were separated into two parts one part of it would simply be to find candidate ads
 good idea is you know we might have like a million as in her system but in order to reduce the set of Canada as we might show you we want to nail this down to like a hundred or $1,000 first so once part of a machine racing near Rhode Island entire set of 200 that's what did you take these Canada as and to predict their CT are so giving a user an ad we would be this information Learning Systems to try to predict whether to use your more recent work you you posted a product analysis of airbnb's search and Discovery process on your block and this is really in-depth study of how Airbnb does certain flawed things in in the search process in kind of a proposal for ways you could
 they could be improved you don't work at Airbnb but what was your motivation for writing this post so am I the one I've worked on this kind of analysis at allowed to park on the side of my house I told her yeah can you describe your approach and more details pretty interesting so I think the problem with most of it with a lot of machine Learning System that different companies is that people will so do analyze a search and Discovery system
 call Metroplex CTR nyctrs high or like what our problem is that I could be improved with the iron golem and so you try to find an Airbnb listing and just like write them for me and tell me why they're good or bad and so I find this really useful because one gives you a lot more data than you can get buy something look at your logs like you look at your logs you don't really understand the reasons why someone didn't click on the video like the reason someone didn't put on a video or because it was a battle this thing or is it bad video but like
 I'm acting like right moment you watch the video or maybe they did already seen the video before or maybe it was like the Cubans for all the reasons they like or dislike when it's over commissions they get it just needs a lot more insight into what's wrong with your heart or what's good about it and then based off of that inside you can't end like the policies and better like that are possible fixes to make sure you got them to go on Airbnb and you said hey like search search for some places imagine a vacation you want to take and try to find an Airbnb that would suit that vacation were the results of the potato set that came back to you there are probably too big problem is with MB Airbnb surgery they have them as it currently stands when is location
 but even if I like someone was trying to search for search for places to stay near Disneyland near Anaheim California but then for some reason the MLB search search I want you to take into account other one is keywords so if you look at a lot of things but this listing but only if you stayed here for a minimum of 3 days so just like all this kind of textual stuff that the host says in description that isn't part of any structured data set that everybody has and so if you like even if you were trying to search for a listing on everybody and you specify that you only want to stay like when one night or two nights you'll get in the search results
 is how to say that you are you need a 3-day minimum and so it's kind of analysis of research so why is this a data science problem why is search and Discovery a data science problem so I think it's just because so much potential for machine learning learning systems and means that you need a lot of data in order to improve lost a design problem and I'm free just because you have so much data and so many users interacting with search history that gives you a lot even more worried about these users data science help understand what it is you're doing and why from the perspective of the machine learning Engineers on the side of Airbnb we're trying to improve this service
 do to improve it one one thing you can do is just got more features so I mentioned that MD search mechanical NASA currently stands is that it doesn't really understand what the host has written in description of the Spy that there's a 3-day minimum stay if they may be the host has a lot of rules stating that I don't no kids allowed or you need to clean up after yourself and so if everybody could describe more features about all these listings that would be super helpful it's another are you can think about is photos of many people want to stay in all those things that are that are really pretty for the things that are going to clean and sober
 how difficult is it to augment a search engines pre-existing model with new features
 I'm so it will say it depends on how your search engine works so if you have a machine Learning System Charlie machine learning based add this as another feature into your black box machine learning search I roll them and your kind of fun challenges to gather all these features and make sure that they're cracked or not noisy and that you have the infrastructure to actually support learning and training or all these features but if it's a black box game system based Google search engine for example is actually pretty famous for having relatively little machine learning it's actually right very role-based
 only recently started experimenting with want to make sure if they roll them all then I'd be enough feature can be pretty complicated because it's kind of hard to tell how adding a new feature War affect the way in this experiment you also studied hotels versus Airbnb what type of person tends to stay in a hotel despite their knowledge that Airbnb exists
 I need them so I think a couple reason people prefer to stay at a hotel sometimes so pissed at Shoppers off of Brodie stay in hotels because it's easier you can I get the listing every time and you know what you're getting like where is a maybe it can be a bit
 uncertain about the quality like you know know if your host is going to be there on time you don't quite know is the the pictures in the hostess things are going to match up with what you actually find you're pretty much guaranteed equality with the hotel people who are the best budget conscious so about people who use to be a lot cheaper
 interesting so you recently wrote a post on quora about when a b testing should not be trusted when should we distrust a b testing results
 yes old you are a case I think when when you run an AP test at 10% a pretty significant what you see when you watch TV test you under percent of users of that is so often times a week do you want me to 10% / users we might see something like a 30% increase once we watch that you are very sweet actually seen no games at all and so the reason for that was awesome because of budget effects
 and so what this means is that when advertisers on ads on Twitter or basically and you have a system to do something like say they only want to spend a million dollars so up all night off and it rises is maybe your abs when it's one on 10% of users its uses up in advertisers entire budget so just when I was trying to show Dads from Despicable Advertiser Sierra and it didn't show ask for anyone else and that's why I'm really well when you want you to Cynthia brott's and no longer has budget to expand Beyond a baby test user base you basically
 that problem yesterday solution it's what is to ramp up your AP test checking to see if your baby tested positive results for Noah Cyrus in it when it was launched to 5% / user base and then immediately launching 200% of users if it did you would do something like maybe wrap it up to like 15 or 20% and its positives and like maybe continue to be testing failure that you describe just called cannibalization and crossover you gave an example of how this can occur on a Marketplace like Airbnb can you explain that example
 suda idea cannibalization
 and maybe test on Airbnb and what you say is what it does is it the worse the price of every single listing in your experiment and now the suppose that we are Bob who would have bought a listing on Airbnb even if the price haven't changed
 and but I cannot if he sees a lower price he decides to buy something and he decides to choose a listing from the from the experiment instead and so even though you would have bought something in the face in the ending non-experimental version of Airbnb buys it anyways and so looks like the experiment is basically positive like I get some more bookings then then the people who are in an experiment but it's only because it's cannibalize from the people who were not an experiment okay but the control group projects are you working on now I think you left Dropbox recently so what do you do with your time
 I am so I spend my time on my project so I'm putting up a form so whatever you need to do with whether or whether it's to like Call of a business or you so whiny somebody Honda usability side I think a lot of people who would want to use Mechanical Turk but don't
 you don't use it because it's something else like a really difficult and confusing interface
 people don't know how to pay workers in order to even create a task which is a lot of people but I hate running so I thought you a lot of people who just can't get good quality on Mechanical Turk like I seen people who had to reject work I got myself like I've I've seen I've seen cases where are some of my iPhone myself have been like 20 to 30% spam entirely so can you tell me more about how your building out your platform like what the user experiences like in higher architecting it
 is like what's a you know
 you know nothing about Mechanical Turk or a thousand businesses and this is like the spreadsheet that you got from your sales team or maybe the latest spreadsheet of a list of potential customers and now what you want to do is stick figure out their phone numbers and so instead of the normal process of you having to download a spreadsheet as a CT in CSV file and then going to make out of wood for banana pudding as you see if I own a running for some instructions and am I creating some HTML and then like checking all the state of her quality will you will you kind of want to do is love you so I have to do is just click a button in this spreadsheet will just get sent to like thousands of workers and then another call on me and it said she will just get it out for you based off
 responses at all this to do your Airbnb experiment to clarify how these are space worst can you can you describe how you use it what you were submitting and what the workflow was like so what I did was I ask people to you
 two to think about a place they wanted to travel to and then they would do a search for that plays on everybody and try to find a good listing and put away that work on my spreadsheet open and I have like a couple different times and it was like where do you want to travel I never call him was like how good you would you write the persisting and bye. And so basically all I had to do was especially Cox and out to the hundreds of workers and not based off of the empty call on with you just filled out for me
 is the goal of this platform specifically to make it easier for data science teams to get training data that's one big application should I gather data on Twitter I had to go to the classifier what gender are users actually were using system. I think I need information on but I think you're a lot more presentable we can use this to do a lot of user research and find a super useful because they need to find a contact information about their potential sales candidates
 startup sword Technologies Facebook or magic where operator required is kind of human element to DARE technology and so I like the ice machine Learning System itself
 interesting do you think is is this like one end of the gradient of the gig economy ultimate economic effect of these types of these types of platforms are the economics as well. Very very good for my workers form you can't really get another job because I have to stay at home and watch their kid or maybe they're like they recently suffered an injury so I can get some broken foot or try to work and so this is a good way for them to make money like everybody find any other job in. Since it's very good economically
 differences between this and other like economies like Uber or they store instacart starasia credit they have very localized in a sense that people in Chicago don't have to compete with people in India you kind of do in the sexually like Charlie online platform and so is it when there are these like to aggressively get the prices to converge where they should be yeah it's a bit hard because I because pricing effects quality so much
 and because I get the difference between you workers experience rockers it's the word of God speak about this potential solution I had was like you get the workers in a situation where in order to gauge subjective situations you force them to wager on things so it basically gives them skin in the game know if there's a 6 payout you QQ make a dynamic pay out also so basically like if they say you don't like it if you're if you're like a Turk task like hey identify picture and like the turkey supposed to say hey that's a cat or whatever how sure are you this is a cat and the only way that they can describe how
 sure they are is they have to wager so you have the quality built into the fact that they're wagering on it actually do something kind of Summer where do I look on the catheter Kylie still bonus people if they do but it really good work as a kind of way of making up for the fact that the the Baseline which may not be a great guy you worked at Peter teals fund clarium Capital he has a saying big data is off and dumb data
 so I admit I actually had not heard him say that phrase before so I don't know what he would actually agree your interpretation be in is that like actually sounded like very very true I want a contrast my experience and Clay reimbursed like there's a text as well it's that you basically often times don't try to do anything smart with it if you don't you don't analyze that way you don't run as complicated as you're kind of a little bit less rigorous and I wear as you kind of got a little fancier you un Pais things more deeply when you have I called and I think City for two reasons one is like off and I like a lot of data they're just so many possible things
 like Tony Parker wins and somebody possibly impactful things that you can do that just kind of no need to to go deeper in the second reason is that like honestly it's just too expensive to to run that complicated or answer when you have
 soda companies mostly have more data than they can actually and analyze these days
 I actually completely agree I would pretty much always sample it to just like fire 10% of users first and that would be more than enough and
 it's
 I guess I could be doing a lot more if they send me step down since the day they were able to work faster faster I think I don't have any don't have any data scientist
 how do you identify the point of diminishing returns like when you're collecting too much data I can if you like what you are like they're 10 most important questions are or if you ask anyone else have company like what are the 10 things you wish you knew but you don't right now a lot of people can't even come up with those like they have no idea what it ended questions are there nobody like what the 10-day got questions if they knew the answers to these questions try to compete most board like most companies don't know that and so if you don't even know what those questions are then
 and so I think that's a sign that you bought that has any question you want to be meaningful
 micro yeah you should stay I actually always say this I I still find like Twitter's they decided on the like my favorite Us in the world just because it's like it really is like a window into the world and where I was going to say the same thing as facebook facebook as well I kind of like immediately without a huge privacy concerns just because there's a lot of structured to
 so I was late for the result that I want to make a news article or interview with you were you said you were considering using the Twitter data feed to find out if people eat McDonald's when they're sad but did you actually do that I did not but I wish I'd done when I was at your door that I never had to do
 Amity self I was using Twitter to figure out with people eat McDonald's when they're sad
 what's ESO
 is right now so one way is to use some playoff
 so at first I need to go to some kind of like sentiment analysis class fire to see like weather at weed is happy or sad and so soon I've already I would try to see if I can I guess I can soon after a sad sweetie or maybe before I decide to see if they mention that they're eating at McDonald's more
 I see if there's a difference between like these have compared to McDonald's in The Roundhouse Suites South one way I would do it another way would be to try to use whatever I geolocation data Twitter has in it somehow I guess I'm going to see if I keep are like checking in at McDonald's or treating from McDonald's when you're happier Saturn
 interesting do you have any other like interesting stories of ad hoc Twitter analysis you've done
 if so I actually like one of my favorite office is trying to see like weather Twitter could have predicted the election results so just like during the 2012 election election were saying that they were voting for Obama or what voting for
 with the overall control the companies that you've worked at and that fascinates me because I personally I've never worked a job that I've enjoyed as how do you find joy as an employee
 yeah man I've had my ups and downs as well but thanks for me what I look for or things like I like doing things were Adida is Oxley like going to be super useful and anywhere I think I can come here when I was I drop box because I didn't find that people cared as much about theater I drop box as I was hoping it was very happy and then I got outside of data type of sauce I guess just like working with like a huge motivator what were the ways that you wish you could have use data more aggressively a Dropbox
 so I think short box is in a state where is it
 when is
 doesn't know what products it should be building and so I think data and user research can help a lot with that and then to it doesn't
 I haven't fought Charlene enough about the
 weather D trends that have supported it until now or going to continue in the future and what I mean by that is that people like turn to Dropbox initially because they wanted you
 this is me away from each other or do you want it back up there that was like 6 years ago and Showbox doesn't really know whether that's a product Trend that's when I going to see you in the future and also doesn't know whether that set up early users
 like that said early users might be over very different from like the next one building users that I need to pursue and it doesn't really know whether those that's a different side of you exactly a couple broad question to close off how will recommendation systems change our world in the near future
 increasing Trend that I've seen designers in more and more on as opposed A of scientist is do you say good idea is you know where bombarded with so much information that if we could like recommendation system filter all day like the noise from us so that we could just like focus on our lives being distracted by all these things in art or science
 I like the science behind it to make sure to anything you mine and it's actually rigorous and hopefully true and then it's an art in that you need to be working on the right questions I know that sounds kind of cool but which I think would never really have any attacks on the product and the information. I think that begin with the right questions that you should be trying to
 the final question who is the engineer that has impacted your life the most so I would say but there were a couple
 couple engineer as I knew I Twitter who I really have a huge respect for and that I think I'm going to walk from and so these would be rant and Oscar Boykin
 so I can send to you.
